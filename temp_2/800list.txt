                The Viking BBS's Bi-Annual 800 BBS List

                        by Sysop of The Viking BBS

        This listing of 800 Bulletin Board System Numbers come from
        a small town Bulletin Board System called The Viking BBS. The
        Sysop of The Viking BBS, after a lot of frustration with other
        BBS Lists, has compiled a list, though a rather short one, of 
        WORKING 800 BBS Numbers as of May 8, 1993.  Since there are 
        not as many 800 Numbered BBS's as there used to be, this list
        takes a while to compile and be sure that each number works.
        That's why this list will only be published every 6 months and
        will be distributed via modem.  We hope you enjoy this list
        and if you would like to contribute to this list, call The 
        Viking BBS at 207-548-2316 weekdays between 5:30pm-7am EST or 
        24hrs a day on the weekends and leave a comment to the sysop
        with the name and 800 number of the bbs.
