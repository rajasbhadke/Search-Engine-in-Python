about/. Action planning activity: Country action planningxxiAction planning activity: Country action planningAims of the activity:To allow participants to connect with colleagues in their country/region and develop 
their team work skillsTo allow participants to generate actions for their country that will help prevent 

some of the negative impacts on health from climate changeTo generate a sense of action, enthusiasm and pride in participants at the 

culmination of the training.
Required resources:Tables and chairs at the back of the training room that groups can sit around, or 

floor space (if comfortable)Flipchart paperColoured markersBackground music and speakersTiming: 30 minutes
Delivery notes for this exercise:Set up the exercise carefully Œ ensure all participants are in a group that works for them. For 
example participants from individual Pacific Islands without colleagues from their country 
present may choose to group together with others for a subregional or regional grouping. 

Encourage participants to decide together what makes most sense as an action planning 
scale for them to work on. It is possible for one person to work on a country action plan, as 
long as they draw in others and rework the action plan with representatives who will need to 
be involved once they get home.Allow for independent work Œ Encouraging participants to work together and decide how they will tackle this exercise helps achieve part of the purpose of this activity, which is 

to give participants experience in working together effectively as a team Œ something they 
will require when implementing the action plan.Consider the format for the presentations that will follow the exercise Œ You 
may want to change the room set up (in the break) or invite external guests to see the 
presentations, in order to increase the sense of significance given to the action the 
participants are committing to undertake in their country/region.Instructions for delivery1. Ask participants to come to a clear area of the room in a huddle, and introduce the 
idea of country action planning.
Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
xxii ﬁYou™ve had some time to make a plan for your own work and how as health 
professionals you can help protect health in your country from climate change. We 
now want to give you the chance to gather with others from your country or region 
to decide what you would like to do back in your country to together tackle the 
health impacts from climate change.ﬂ ﬁPlease arrange yourself into country groups. If you are the only person from your 
country here, you could form into a sub-regional or regional grouping, or you could 

develop a country plan on your own Œ whatever feels most appropriate for designing 
a climate change and health action plan that can be implemented. So please move 
into groups now, and stand with your group mates so I can see that everyone has 

decided on their grouping, or that they™ll work solo.ﬂ
 Watch the group and check in with anyone who looks confused. Move amongst 
the groups and check everyone is happy, asking if everyone knows who they are 

working with. NB: Have a fellow trainer count how many finalised groups there are.
2. Ok, now that you™re in your groups, you have the next 25 minutes to create an 
action plan for protecting health from climate change in your country or region. I™m going to leave it to you to decide as a group how you will go about this, and 
what format you™ll come up with. At the end of the 25 minutes Œ at 
X pm - you need to be prepared to give a short presentation to the group (and invited guests Œ if relevant) on the action plan you come up with. In this room you have flipchart paper and markers, and a whiteboard one or two 
groups could use. I™ll give you some time reminders as you go. Are there any 
questions before you start? Ok, go for it.ﬂ3. Set timer.
 Work out the length the country presentations will be able to be (see the session 
plan for the total time block for presentations), based on how many groups there are.4. Give time reminders at:
 Œ
10 minutes (15 minutes to go), and tell groups how long they will have for their presentation Œ
18 minutes (7 minutes to go). Encourage groups to get working on what they will present if they have done already, and ask groups to decide on two 

representatives to present their action plan; and Œ
22 minutes (3 minutes to go).5. At 
25 minutes ask participants to finish their action plans and pack up their materials. If a break is scheduled, send people off for some fresh air before they sit through 
presentations. Otherwise start straight into the presentations, asking for a group to Action planning activity: Country action planningxxiiinominate to present first. Remind everyone of the time they have for presentations, and that you™ll be giving them a 30 second warning and then a wrap up signal.
 Use a timer, ‚30 seconds to go™ sign (if desired Œ this can be written on a page or 
coloured post it note) and keep to time to prevent the presentations from spilling 
over.
 Encourage applause at the end of each presentation, and then call for a next 
country to present. Ideally pages will be stuck up on the wall or a spare whiteboard 
for display, where they can be photographed one by one.
6. At the end of all presentations acknowledge the action plans and ask for another 
round of applause. If there is time, call for short reflections from other trainers or 
invited guests, giving the participants a sense that their action is significant, and that 
following through on their action plans is highly valued.7. To document and share the actions that have been generated, have a trainer or 
photographer photograph all the action plans if possible, and let the group know 
how these will be documented. Ask each group to decide what they will do with the 
hardcopy version, and ask a representative to come and get their plan at the end of 
the session/training (whenever the photographing is completed.)GlossaryxxvGlossaryAdaptation: The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to 
expected climate and its effects.Adaptation assessment: The practice of identifying options to adapt to climate change and evaluating them in terms of criteria such as availability, benefits, costs, effectiveness, 
efficiency, and feasibility.
Adaptation Fund: 
A Fund established under the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 and officially 
launched in 2007. The Fund finances adaptation projects and programmes in developing 

countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Financing comes mainly from sales of 

Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) and a share of proceeds amounting to 2% of the 
value of CERs issued each year for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. The 
Adaptation Fund can also receive funds from government, private sector, and individuals.
Adaptation measures: This refer to actual adjustments, or changes in decision environments, which might enhance resilience or reduce vulnerability to observed or expected changes in climate.Ambient air pollution: Air pollution in the ambient environment, that is, in outdoor air, but 
able to enter homes.
Air pollution: One or more chemicals or substances in high enough concentrations in the air to harm humans, other animals, vegetation, or materials. Such chemicals or physical conditions (such as excess heat or noise) are called air pollutants.Air quality guidelines: Value at or under which a pollutant is considered to have no or 
minimal impact on health.
Anthropogenic: Human made. In the context of greenhouse gases, emissions that are produced as the result of human activities.
Atmosphere: The gaseous envelope surrounding the earth, divided into five layers Š the troposphere which contains half of the earth™s atmosphere, the stratosphere, 
the mesosphere, the thermosphere, and the exosphere, which is the outer limit of the 
atmosphere. The dry atmosphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing 
ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together with a number of trace gases, 
such as argon (0.93% volume mixing ratio), helium and radiatively active greenhouse gases 
(GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2) (0.035% volume mixing ratio) and ozone (O3). In addition, the atmosphere contains the GHG water vapour (H2O), whose amounts are highly 
variable but typically around 1% volume mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds 
and aerosols.Atmospheric brown clouds (ABCs): Are regional scale plumes of air pollution that consist of copious amounts of tiny particles of soot, sulphates, nitrates, fly ash and many other pollutants.Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
xxviAnnex I Parties / countries: 
The group of countries listed in Annex I to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Under Articles 4.2 (a) and 4.2 (b) of 
the UNFCCC, Annex I Parties were committed to adopting national policies and measures 

with the non-legally binding aim to return their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 1990 
levels by 2000. The group is largely similar to the Annex B Parties to the Kyoto Protocol that 

also adopted emissions reduction targets for 2008 Œ 2012. By default, the other countries are 
referred to as Non-Annex I Parties.
Annex II Parties / countries: 
The group of countries listed in Annex II to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Under Article 4 of the UNFCCC, 
these countries have a special obligation to provide financial resources to meet the agreed 
full incremental costs of implementing measures mentioned under Article 12, paragraph 1. 
They are also obliged to provide financial resources, including for the transfer of technology, 

to meet the agreed incremental costs of implementing measures covered by Article 12, 
paragraph 1 and agreed between developing country Parties and international entities 

referred to in Article 11 of the UNFCCC. This group of countries shall also assist countries 
that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.Anthropogenic greenhouse emissions: Greenhouse-gas emissions resulting from human 
activities.
Biological model: a mathematical approach to determine the relationship between environmental variables and an outcome of interest (e.g. the distribution of disease vectors) 

using biological associations between the environment and aspects of population dynamics 
(e.g. how insect development rates change with temperature). Unlike 
statistical models, this approach requires detailed understanding of disease population dynamics.Carbon dioxide: A colorless, odorless, nonpoisonous gas that is a normal part of the ambient air. Carbon dioxide is a product of fossil fuel combustion. Although carbon dioxide does 

not directly impair human health, it is a greenhouse gas that traps terrestrial (i.e., infrared) 
radiation and contributes to the potential for global warming.
Carbon monoxide: Colorless, odourless, toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion of carbon containing materials.Capacity-building: In the context of climate change, the process of developing the technical skills and institutional capability in developing countries and economies in transition to enable them to address effectively the causes and results of climate change.Climate change: Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e. g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and / or the variability of 
its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate 

change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of 
the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition 
of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on 

Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: ‚a change of climate 
which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of 
the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over 
comparable time periods™. The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change 
attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition, and climate variability 
attributable to natural causes. GlossaryxxviiClimate prediction: A climate prediction or climate forecast is the result of an attempt to produce a most likely description or estimate of the actual evolution of the climate in the future (e.g., at seasonal, interannual, or long-term time-scales).
Climate projection: A projection of the response of the climate system to emission or concentration scenarios of greenhouse gases and aerosols, or radiative forcing scenarios, often based upon simulations by climate models. Climate projections are distinguished 
from climate predictions in order to emphasize that climate projections depend upon the 
emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which are based on assumptions, 
concerning, for example, future socioeconomic and technological developments that may or 

may not be realized, and are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty.
Climate scenario: A plausible and often simplified representation of the future climate, based on an internally consistent set of climatological relationships, that has been constructed for explicit use in investigating the potential consequences of anthropogenic 
climate change, often serving as input to impact models. Climate projections often serve 
as the raw material for constructing climate scenarios, but climate scenarios usually require 
additional information such as about the observed current climate. A ﬁclimate change 
scenarioﬂ is the difference between a climate scenario and the current climate.Climate-Sensitive Health Outcome
 is any health outcome whose geographic range, incidence, or intensity of transmission is directly or indirectly associated with weather or climate.Climate Variability
 describes variations in the mean state and other statistics (e.g.,standard 
deviations, the occurrence of extreme events, etc.) of climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural internal 

processes within the climate system or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external 
forcing. 
Cholera: An intestinal infection, caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which results in frequent watery stools, cramping abdominal pain, and eventual collapse from dehydration. It is thought that zooplankton in cold waters may carry large number of cholera vibrios on their bodies. Zooplankton feed by grazing on phytoplankton which bloom with sunshine and warm conditions. Thus, a phytoplankton (algal) bloom may lead to an increase in the 
population of zooplankton which carry the vibrios.Cobenefits: benefits (often health benefits) associated with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. For example, reduced emissions of air pollutants can have immediate 

health benefits. In addition, there can be cobenefits of adaptation measures, such as new 
surveillance systems that monitor climate-related and nonclimate-related infectious diseases.
Conference of the Parties (COP): 
The supreme body of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), comprising countries with a right to vote that 
have ratified or acceded to the convention. It currently meets once a year to review the 
Convention™s progress. The word ﬁconferenceﬂ is not used here in the sense of ﬁmeetingﬂ 

but rather of ﬁassociationﬂ. The ﬁConferenceﬂ meets in sessional periods, for example, the 

ﬁfourth session of the Conference of the Parties.ﬂ
Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules

Dengue/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF): An acute febrile syndrome caused by dengue arbovirus type 1Œ4, commonly transmitted by the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti 
and Ae. albopictus
, which breed in small water bodies in containers, car tyres, etc. Dengue is often called breakbone fever because it is characterized by severe pain in joints and back. 
Subsequent infections of dengue virus may lead to dengue haemorrhagic fever, which can 

be fatal.Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY): 
An indicator of life expectancy combining mortality and morbidity into one summary measure of population health to account for the number 
of years lived in less than optimal health. It is a health measure developed for calculating the 
global burden of disease that is also used by WHO, the World Bank and other organizations 

to compare the outcomes of different interventions.Disaster: A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.Disaster risk management (DRM): Processes for designing, implementing, and evaluating 
strategies, policies, and measures to improve the understanding of disaster risk, foster disaster 
risk reduction and transfer, and promote continuous improvement in disaster preparedness, 

response, and recovery practices, with the explicit purpose of increasing human security, 

well-being, quality of life, and sustainable development.
Drought: The phenomenon that exists when precipitation has been significantly below normal recorded levels, causing serious hydrological imbalances.Dysentery: An infection of the gut caused by shigella bacteria. Symptoms include acute bloody diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pains and fever.

Early warning systems (EWS): A system consisting of Mathematical models and surveillance measures designed for the early detection, prevention and control of an epidemic of infectious disease or other abnormal event (e.g., famine or heat waves).
El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO): El Niño, in its original sense, is a warm water current that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. 
This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of the intertropical surface pressure 
pattern and circulation in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, called the Southern Oscillation. 

This coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon is collectively known as El Niño Southern 

Oscillation, or ENSO. During an El Niño event, the prevailing trade winds weaken and the 

equatorial countercurrent strengthens, causing warm surface waters in the Indonesian area 
to flow eastward to overlie the cold waters of the Peru current. This event has great impact 

on the wind, sea surface temperature, and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. 

It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world. 

The opposite of an El Niño event is called La Niña. The accepted definition is a warming 
or cooling of at least 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) averaged over the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean. 

Typically, this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of 2Œ7 years and lasts nine months to 

two years. The average period length is 5 years. When this warming or cooling occurs for 
only seven to nine months, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña ﬁconditionsﬂ; when it occurs for 
more than that period, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña ﬁepisodesﬂ.GlossaryxxixExtreme weather event: An extreme weather event is an event that is rare within its statistical reference distribution at a particular place. Definitions of ﬁrareﬂ vary, but an 
extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th 
percentile. By definition, the characteristics of what is called extreme weather may vary from 
place to place. An extreme climate event is an average of a number of weather events over a 
certain period of time, an average which is itself extreme (e.g., rainfall over a season).
Global warming (GW): usually: the warming trend over the past century or so; also: any period in which the temperature of the Earth™s atmosphere increases; also the theory of such 

changes.Emissions: Releases of gases to the atmosphere (e.g., the release of carbon dioxide during 
fuel combustion). Emissions can be either intended or unintended releases.Exposure: Amount of a factor to which a group or individual was exposed; sometimes contrasted with dose (the amount that enters or interacts with the organism). Exposures may 
be either beneficial or harmful.Fecal-oral transmission:
 is a route of transmission of a disease, when pathogens in fecal particles passing from one host are introduced into the oral cavity of another host.
Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)
: The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, released in 2014.
Food security: 
A situation that exists when people have secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth, development and an active and healthy life. 
Food insecurity may be caused by the unavailability of food, insufficient purchasing power, 

inappropriate distribution, or inadequate use of food at the household level. Flood: Temporary partial or complete inundation of normally dry areas caused by rapid 
runoff or overflow from lakes, rivers, or tidal waters.Fossil fuels: 
Carbon-based fuels from fossil hydrocarbon deposits, including coal, peat, oil, and natural gas.Gastroenteritis: Inflammation of the stomach and the intestines. Gastroenteritis can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Gastroenteritis has numerous causes, including infections 
(viruses, bacteria, and parasites), food poisoning, and stress.
Glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF): 
Flood associated with outburst of glacial lake. Glacial lake outburst floods are typically a result of cumulative developments and occur (i) only once 
(e.g., full breach failure of moraine-dammed lakes), (ii) for the first time (e.g., new formation 

and outburst of glacial lakes), and/or (iii) repeatedly (e.g., ice-dammed lakes with drainage 

cycles, or ice fall). Global Environment Facility (GEF): 
The Global Environment Facility, established 
in 1991, helps developing countries fund projects and programmes that protect the 
global environment. GEF grants support projects related to biodiversity, climate change, 

international waters, land degradation, the ozone (O3) layer, and persistent organic 
pollutants.Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
xxxGlobal climate model, also General Circulation Model or GCM - a computer model of the world™s climate system, including the atmosphere and oceans.Global mean surface temperature: An estimate of the global mean surface air temperature. However, for changes over time, only anomalies, as departures from a climatology, are used, 
most commonly based on the area-weighted global average of the sea surface temperature 
anomaly and land surface air temperature anomaly.
Global surface temperature: The global surface temperature is the area-weighted global average of the sea surface temperature over the oceans (i.e., the subsurface bulk temperature in the first few metres of the ocean), and the surface air temperature over land 
at 1.5 m above the ground.Global warming: Global warming refers to the gradual increase, observed or projected, in global surface temperature, as one of the consequences of radiative forcing caused by 
anthropogenic emissions.Green Climate Fund (GCF): 
The Green Climate Fund was established by the 16th Session 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in 2010 as an operating entity of the financial 

mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in 

accordance with Article 11 of the Convention, to support projects, programmes and policies 
and other activities in developing country Parties. The Fund is governed by a Board and will 

receive guidance of the COP. The Fund is headquartered in Songdo, Republic of Korea.
Greenhouse gas (GHG): Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific 
wavelengths within the spectrum of terrestrial radiation emitted by the earth™s surface, the 

atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour 

(H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ozone (O3) are the primary GHGs in the earth™s atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely 

human-made GHGs in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and 

brominecontaining substances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO2, 
N2O and CH4, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the GHGs sulphur hexafluoride (SF
6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). For a list of well-mixed GHGs, see 

WGI AR5 Table 2.A.1.
Greenhouse effect: The effect created by the band of greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth. The greenhouse effect keeps the Earth™s surface within a temperature range that makes 
life on Earth (as we know it) possible.Health: A state of complete physical, mental and social well being, and not merely the 
absence of disease or infirmity.

Health impact assessment (HIA): A combination of procedures, methods and tools by which a policy, project or hazard may be judged as to its potential effects on the health of a 
population, and the distribution of those effects within the population.Health Systems: Comprises all the organizations, institutions, and resources that are devoted to producing actions principally aimed at improving, maintaining, or restoring health. (World 
Health Organization. 2007)GlossaryxxxiHealth system strengthening: Defined by the WHO in reference to its current framework as, ﬁimproving the six building blocks and managing their interactions in ways that achieve more equitable and sustained improvements across health services and health outcomes, 
requiring both technical and political knowledge and action.ﬂ (WHO 2007, 4) The Hyogo 

Framework for Action (HFA) is the first plan to explain, describe and detail the work that 

is required from all different sectors and actors to reduce disaster losses. It was developed 
and agreed on with the many partners needed to reduce disaster risk - governments, 
international agencies, disaster experts and many others - bringing them into a common 
system of coordination.Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):
 Established in 1988 by the World 
Meteorological Organization and the UN Environment Programme, the IPCC surveys world-wide scientific and technical literature and publishes assessment reports that are widely 
recognized as the most credible existing sources of information on climate change. The 
IPCC also works on methodologies and responds to specific requests from the Convention™s 

subsidiary bodies. The IPCC is independent of the Convention.Kyoto Protocol: 
The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, at the Third Session of the 

Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC. It contains legally binding commitments, in 

addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Countries included in Annex B of the Protocol 
(most Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and countries 
with economies in transition) agreed to reduce their anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)) by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 Œ 2012. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 

February 2005.
Kyoto mechanisms:
 Three procedures established under the Kyoto Protocol to increase the 
flexibility and reduce the costs of making greenhouse-gas emissions cuts. They are the Clean 

Development Mechanism, Emissions Trading and Joint Implementation.
Land use and land-use change: Land use refers to the total of arrangements, activities, and inputs undertaken in a certain land cover type (a set of human actions). The term land use is also used in the sense of the social and economic purposes for which land is managed (e.g., 

grazing, timber extraction, and conservation). Land-use change refers to a change in the use 

or management of land by humans, which may lead to a change in land cover. Land cover 

and land-use change may have an impact on the surface albedo, evapotranspiration, sources 
and sinks of greenhouse gases, or other properties of the climate system and may thus have 
radiative forcing and/or other impacts on climate, locally or globally.
Least-Developed Countries (LDCs): 
A list of countries designated by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) as meeting three criteria: (1) a low income criterion below a certain threshold of gross national income per capita of between USD 750 
and USD 900, (2) a human resource weakness based on indicators of health, education, 
adult literacy, and (3) an economic vulnerability weakness based on indicators on instability 

of agricultural production, instability of export of goods and services, economic importance 
of nontraditional activities, merchandise export concentration, and the handicap of 
economic smallness. Countries in this category are eligible for a number of programmes 
focused on assisting countries most in need.Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
xxxiiLeast-Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG):
 A panel of 13 experts that provides advice to LDCs on the preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) Œ plans for addressing the urgent and immediate needs of those countries to 

adapt to climate change.Least-Developed Country Fund (LDCF):
 The LDCF is a fund established to support a work programme to assist Least-Developed Country Parties to carry out, inter alia, the preparation 

and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs). The Global 

Environment Facility, as the entity that operates the financial mechanism of the Convention, 

has been entrusted to operate this fund.Loss and damage: At COP 16 in Cancun in 2010, governments established a work programme in order to consider approaches to address loss and damage associated with 
climate change impacts in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the 
adverse effects of climate change as part of the Cancun Adaptation Framework.
Malaria: Endemic or epidemic parasitic disease caused by four species of the protozoan genus Plasmodium that are transmitted to humans by the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. Disease is characterised by high fever attacks and systemic disorders and is responsible for approximately 2 million deaths every year, 90% of which occur in Sub-

Saharan Africa. Malaria is the most serious and common vector-borne disease in the world.
Methane (CH4): One of the six greenhouse gases (GHGs) to be mitigated under the Kyoto 
Protocol and is the major component of natural gas and associated with all hydrocarbon fuels. Significant emissions occur as a result of animal husbandry and agriculture and their 
management represents a major mitigation option. See also Global Warming Potential (GWP) 

and Annex II.9.1 for GWP values.Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): A set of time-bound and measurable goals 
for combating poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, discrimination against women and 
environmental degradation, agreed at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000. Mitigation (of climate change): A human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This report also assesses human interventions to reduce the sources of other substances that may contribute directly or indirectly to limiting climate 
change, including, for example, the reduction of particulate matter (PM) emissions that can 

directly alter the radiation balance (e. g.,black carbon) or measures that control emissions 

of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other pollutants that can alter the concentration of tropospheric ozone (O3), which has an indirect effect on the climate.Montreal Protocol: The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, an 
international agreement adopted in Montreal in 1987.
Morbidity: Rate of occurrence of disease or other health disorder within a population, taking account of the age-specific morbidity rates. Morbidity indicators include chronic 

disease incidence/ prevalence, rates of hospitalization, primary care consultations, disability-
days (i.e., days of absence from work), and prevalence of symptoms. GlossaryxxxiiiMortality: Rate of occurrence of death within a population; calculation of mortality takes account of age-specific death rates, and can thus yield measures of life expectancy and the 
extent of premature death. The national adaptation plan (NAP): The NAP process was established under the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF). It enables Parties to formulate and implement national 
adaptation plans (NAPs) as a means of identifying medium- and long-term adaptation needs 

and developing and implementing strategies and programmes to address those needs. It is a 
continuous, progressive and iterative process that follows a country-driven, gender-sensitive, 

participatory and fully transparent approach.National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs): 
Documents prepared by least-developed countries (LDCs) identifying urgent and immediate needs for adapting to climate 
change.National communication: A document submitted in accordance with the Convention (and the Protocol) by which a Party informs other Parties of activities undertaken to 
address climate change. Most developed countries have now submitted their fifth 
national communications; most developing countries have completed their first national 
communication and are in the process of preparing their second.National delegation: One or more officials empowered to represent and negotiate on behalf of a government.
Nitrous oxide (N2O): One of the six greenhouse gases (GHGs) to be mitigated under the Kyoto Protocol. The main anthropogenic source of N2O is agriculture (soil and animal 

manure management), but important contributions also come from sewage treatment, fossil 
fuel combustion, and chemical industrial processes. N2O is also produced naturally from 
a wide variety of biological sources in soil and water, particularly microbial action in wet 

tropical forests. See also Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Annex II.9.1 for GWP values.
Non-Annex I Parties / countries: 
Non-Annex I Parties are mostly developing countries. 
Certain groups of developing countries are recognized by the Convention as being especially vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, including countries with low-lying 

coastal areas and those prone to desertification and drought. Others, such as countries that 
rely heavily on income from fossil fuel production and commerce, feel more vulnerable 
to the potential economic impacts of climate change response measures. The Convention 
emphasizes activities that promise to answer the special needs and concerns of these 
vulnerable countries, such as investment, insurance, and technology transfer. See also 

Annex I Parties / countries.
Ozone (O3): Ozone, the triatomic form of oxygen (O3), is a gaseous atmospheric constituent. In the troposphere, it is created both naturally and by photochemical reactions 
involving gases resulting from human activities (smog). Tropospheric O3 acts as a greenhouse 

gas (GHG). In the stratosphere, it is created by the interaction between solar ultraviolet 
radiation and molecular oxygen (O2). Stratospheric O3 plays a dominant role in the 
stratospheric radiative balance. Its concentration is highest in the O3 layer.
Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
xxxivParticulate matter (PM): 
Very small solid particles emitted during the combustion of 
biomass and fossil fuels. PM may consist of a wide variety of substances. Of greatest concern for health are particulates of diameter less than or equal to 10 nanometres, usually 
designated as PM10. See also Aerosol.Pathogen:
 An infectious agent such as a virus, bacterium, prion, fungus, viroid, or parasite that causes disease in its host. The host may be an animal, a plant, a fungus, or even another 
microorganism.Policies (for mitigation of or adaptation to climate change): 
Policies are a course of action 
taken and / or mandated by a government, e. g., to enhance mitigation and adaptation. 
Examples of policies aimed at mitigation are support mechanisms for renewable energy 
(RE) supplies, carbon or energy taxes, fuel efficiency standards for automobiles. See also 
Measures.Precipitation: Rain, hail, mist, sleet, snow or any other moisture that falls to the Earth.Radiation: Energy emitted in the form of electromagnetic waves. Radiation has differing characteristics depending upon the wavelength. Because the radiation from the Sun is relatively energetic, it has a short wavelength (e.g., ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared) 

while energy re-radiated from the Earth™s surface and the atmosphere has a longer 

wavelength (e.g., infrared radiation) because the Earth is cooler than the Sun.
Radiative forcing: Radiative forcing is the change in the net, downward minus upward, radiative flux (expressed in W m Œ 2) at the tropopause or top of atmosphere due to a change in an external driver of climate change, such as, for example, a change in the 
concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) or the output of the sun. For the purpose of this 
report, radiative forcing is further defined as the change relative to the year 1750 and refers 
to a global and annual average value.Resilience: The capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for 

adaptation, learning, and transformation (Arctic Council, 2013).
Response: The provision of emergency services and public assistance during or immediately after a disaster in order to save lives, reduce health impacts, ensure public safety and meet 
the basic subsistence needs of the people affected.Risk: (i.e., climate-related risk) is a product of the likelihood of exposure and the 
consequence(s) of that exposure. It arises from the interaction of a physically defined hazard 
(e.g., floods and other extreme weather events, increasing temperature) with the properties 

of the exposed system, its vulnerability (UNDP, 2003). System vulnerability is a critical 

determinant of the risk a region or subpopulation faces when exposed to a particular hazard. 
This means that programs to decrease vulnerability will decrease risk.Rotaviruses: are a leading cause of severe diarrhoeal disease and dehydration in infants and young children throughout the world. Most symptomatic episodes occur in young children between the ages of 3 months and 2 years. The virus spreads rapidly, presumably through 

person-to-person contact, airborne droplets, or possibly contact with contaminated toys.
GlossaryxxxvSalmonellosis: Bacterial food-poisoning caused by Salmonella species, most frequently reported in North America and Europe. Most people become infected by ingesting foods contaminated with significant amounts of Salmonella and the poisoning typically occurs in outbreaks in the general population or hospitals, restaurants, etc. Improperly handled 
or undercooked poultry and eggs are the foods which most frequently cause Salmonella 
food poisoning. Chickens are a major carrier of 
Salmonella bacteria, which accounts for its prominence in poultry products.Sea level change/sea level rise: Sea level can change, both globally and locally, due to 
changes in the shape of the ocean basins, changes in the total mass of water and changes in water density. Factors leading to sea-level rise under global warming include both increases 

in the total mass of water from the melting of land-based snow and ice, and changes in 
water density from an increase in ocean water temperatures and salinity changes. Relative 
sea level rise occurs where there is a local increase in the level of the ocean relative to the 
land, which might be due to ocean rise and/or land level subsidence.Sensitivity: describes an individual™s or subpopulation increased responsiveness, primarily for biological reasons, to a particular exposure. Biological sensitivity may be related to developmental stage, preexisting medical conditions, acquired factors (such as immunity), 
and genetic factors (Balbus and Malina 2009). Socioeconomic factors also play a critical role 
in altering vulnerability and sensitivity, by interacting with biological factors that mediate risk 

(such as nutritional status) and/or lead to differences in the ability to adapt or respond to 
exposures or early phases of illness and injury.
Seasonality/seasonal variation: Seasonal fluctuations in disease incidence or prevalence or other phenomena (e.g. abundance of 
vectors). Shigellosis is an acute invasive enteric infection caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Shigella; it is clinically manifested by diarrhoea that is frequently bloody.

Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF): 
The SCCF was established to finance projects relating to adaptation; technology transfer and capacity building; energy, transport, industry, 

agriculture, forestry and waste management; and economic diversification. This fund should 
complement other funding mechanisms for the implementation of the Convention. The 
Global Environment Facility (GEF), as the entity that operates the financial mechanism of the 

Convention, has been entrusted to operate this fund. Stratosphere: Second layer of the atmosphere, extending from about 19 to 48 kilometers (12 to 30 miles) above the earth™s surface. It contains small amounts of gaseous ozone (O3), 
which filters out about 99 percent of the incoming harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Most 
commercial airline flights operate at a cruising altitude in the lower stratosphere.Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI): The SBI makes recommendations on policy and implementation issues to the COP and, if requested, to other bodies.
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA): 
The SBSTA serves as a 
link between information and assessments provided by expert sources (such as the IPCC) 
and the COP, which focuses on setting policy.
Sulfur dioxide (SO2): A compound composed of one sulfur and two oxygen molecules. Sulfur dioxide emitted into the atmosphere through natural and anthropogenic processes Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
xxxviis changed in a complex series of chemical reactions in the atmosphere to sulfate aerosols. These aerosols are believed to result in negative radiative forcing (i.e., tending to cool the 
Earth™s surface) and do result in acid deposition (e.g., acid rain).
Sustainable development: Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Surveillance: Continuous analysis, interpretation and feedback of systematically collected data for the detection of trends in the occurrence or spread of a disease, based on practical and standardized methods of notification or registration. Sources of data may be related 
directly to disease or factors influencing disease.Time-series analysis: 
Statistical methods used to describe events that are measured in an ordered sequence at equally-spaced time intervals, and often to analyse their variations 
as functions of other variables (e.g. analyses of daily records of daily 
mortality rates, as a function of concurrent variation in temperature).Transmission cycle
: The transmission of pathogens from current to future host follows a repeating cycle. This cycle can be simple, with a direct transmission from current to future host, or complex, where transmission occurs through (multiple) intermediate hosts or vectors.
Typhoid fever is a bacterial disease, caused by 
Salmonella typhi. It is transmitted through the ingestion of food or drink contaminated by the faeces or urine of infected people. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): 
The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York and signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in 
Rio de Janeiro by more than 150 countries and the European Community. Its ultimate 

objective is the ‚stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a 
level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system™. 

It contains commitments for all Parties under the principle of ‚common but differentiated 

responsibilities™. Under the Convention, Parties included in Annex I aimed to return 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions not controlled by the Montreal Protocol to 1990 levels 
by the year 2000. The convention entered in force in March 1994. In 1997, the UNFCCC 
adopted the Kyoto Protocol.
Uncertainty: An expression of the degree to which a value is unknown. This can result from lack of information or disagreement about what is known. Uncertainty can be represented by quantitative measures (e.g. a range of values calculated by mathematical models) or 
qualitative statements (e.g. reflecting the judgement of a team of experts).
Undernutrition: Is defined as the outcome of insufficient food intake and repeated infectious diseases. It includes being underweight for one™s age, too short for one™s age 
(stunted), dangerously thin for one™s height (wasted) and deficient in vitamins and minerals 
(micronutrient malnutrition).Vector: 
An organism that acts as an essential intermediate host or definite host for a human pathogen and that plays an active role in its transmission; for example, Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors of malaria. This definition excludes mechanical carriers of infective materials (such as houseflies and cockroaches), strictly passive intermediate hosts (e.g. the 
snail hosts of schistosomiasis) and reservoir species (e.g. foxes carrying rabies).
GlossaryxxxviiVector-borne diseases: 
Range of infectious diseases that are transmitted between hosts by vectors such as mosquitoes or ticks (e.g. 
malaria, dengue fever, Lyme disease
).Vibrio species: are natural inhabitants of marine aquatic environments in both temperate and tropical regions.Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): 
Important class of organic chemical air pollutants that are volatile at ambient air conditions. Other terms used to represent VOCs are 
hydrocarbons (HCs), reactive organic gases (ROGs) and non-methane volatile organic 
compounds (NMVOCs). NMVOCs are major contributors Š together with nitrogen oxides 
(NOX), and carbon monoxide (CO) Š to the formation of photochemical oxidants such as 
ozone (O3).Volatile organic compounds (VOCs): 
Organic compounds that evaporate readily into the 
atmosphere at normal temperatures. VOCs contribute significantly to photochemical smog 
production and certain health problems.Vulnerability:
 The degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability 
is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is 

exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.
Weather: 
Atmospheric condition at any given time or place. It is measured in terms of such things as wind, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, cloudiness, and precipitation. 
In most places, weather can change from hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and season-to-season. 

Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the ﬁaverage weatherﬂ, or more rigorously, 

as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over 
a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period 
is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities 

are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a 
wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. A simple 
way of remembering the difference is that climate is what you expect (e.g. cold winters) and 

‚weather™ is what you get (e.g. a blizzard).
Water-related diseases:
 those caused by micro-organisms and chemicals in water people 
drink; diseases like schistosomiasis which have part of their lifecycle in water; diseases like malaria with water-related vectors; drowning and some injuries; and others such as 

legionellosis carried by aerosols containing certain micro-organisms.
Zoonosis: An infectious disease of vertebrate animals, such as rabies, which can be transmitted to humans.Zoonotic disease: A disease that can be passed between animals and humans. Zoonotic diseases can be caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi.Revision activity: Graffiti wallxxxixRevision activity: Graffiti wallPurpose of the activity:This revision exercise allows participants to revise their learning from each of the modules covered during training. It also brings in creativity methodology and a group approach, 

helping participants unlock their past experience and be reminded of what was covered in 
the training by their colleagues.Preparation:Using flipchart paper and large marker pens, create one page for each of the modules 
covered during training, writing a large label in the middle of each sheet. Have these ready 

and in the previous Module or a break before running this exercise, fix them in chronological 

order to the walls around the back of the training room. Ensure pages are placed at a 
height that all participants can easily write at. Place marker pens on the floor near the wall, 
or on hand on a nearby table. Allow enough space near the walls for the whole group to 
congregate near all the pages.NB: Make sure that the pages used are thick enough or the ink of the marker pens light enough that participants drawing on the pages won™t go through and mark the walls of the 

training venue! Double thicknesses of paper can be used if necessary, or pages can be placed 

on tables spaced around the room, although this is less visually effective.Required resources:

we™ve covered in the training process. It™s been a busy week, hasn™t it?!
To help remind you of what we™ve covered, I™ve written up each of the modules we 
covered on a page around the room. (Walk to first page). Here you can see we started with 

An introduction to weather and climate – (read off each module as you move or gesture 
around the room so participants know where each is located, and have a verbal reminder of 
what was covered), ending with the Communicating climate change and health module.You now have the chance to do something you probably don™t get very often in your 
work Œ to graffiti over these walls Œ well actually pages Œ with the learning you™re taking away 

from each module.This is a chance to get creative! So in a minute please grab a few of your favourite coloured markers from the middle of the room, and spend the next 10 minutes revolving 
around the back of the room. Write phrases, sentences or words, or draw or doodle what we 

covered, big learning outcomes for you, or phrases you remember.
You can move in any direction, going to pages where there™s not a whole huddle of 
people, but please make sure you leave at least one mark on every page. Go for it Œ have 
fun making your graffiti!Play background music to help people focus on the activity and discourage conversation.Graffiti process Œ 10 minutesStay central in the space, watching the participants as they move around the space, helping hold the focus for the group. Ideally participants should work individually in this process so 
if more than small side conversations bubble up, encourage participants to keep moving 
through the process, giving occasional time reminders throughout the 10 minutes of how 
much longer they have remaining and encouraging them to make sure they get to every 
page.Revision activity: Graffiti wallxliLearning from each other Œ 5 minutesThanks people for their beautiful colourful graffiti, and how much has gone up on the wall.Ask participants to now go back to every page, looking at other participant™s notes, ticking, emphasizing or adding to what others have written, and being reminded of learning 
they™d forgotten about. Ask them to visit every page again over the next 5 minutes, aiming to 

make at least another mark on every page.Give time reminders to keep everyone moving around the room. Move around the pages from afar so you can pick up some of the learnings that are shared by a majority of 
participants.Summary Œ 3 minutesGive participants a 2 and 1 minute count down.Bring participants back together and encourage them to gather around you, looking on to the grafittied pages. Thank the participants and recognize all that they have captured of their shared learnings from the 5 days. Provide some reflection of some of the major learning 
themes that you™ve seen emerging on the pages.
Ask participants to take a step back from pages so they can just see the titles, and reflect on which modules have been their standout learning areas of most value. Ask them 
to pick their top three as they look at the spread of pages, and hold those in their mind. This 
will come in handy as they move into the evaluation coming soon.Introductory activity: Human MapxliiiIntroductory activity: Human MapAims:To allow participants to learn each other™s names and get to know each other at an 
introductory levelTo put participants at ease with sharing ideas and opinions with the group
To create a safe, relaxed and productive learning environment
Required resources:Large open space at the back of the training roomTiming: 15 minutes
Instructions for delivery1. Explain to the participants that to begin the training we are going to do a few exercises 
to help everyone to get to know each other. First off, we™re going to create a map of 
where we all come from.2. Designate a point at the centre of the space to represent the training venue. Stand at 
this point, saying ﬁI™m standing here on the map, representing where we are at the 
university.ﬂ Ask someone to point out North with their arm, and then show which way 

was is East, South and West.
3. Ask the participants to position themselves around the space based on where they live, 
relative to where you™re standing. For example, if a person usually lives in a country 

north but close to the training venue, they will be standing a way away from you but 
on the north axis. Someone who lives in the same city will stand close to you. Tell 

participants that they will have to talk to each other to find out what their place on the 
map should be in relation to each other (which is the point of the exercise) and then 
when they find their place on the map, stand still.4. Watch the group and check everyone has found their place on the map, giving an 
encouragement to the last people to find their place if necessary. 
5. ﬁLet™s now hear who and where we have on this map. I™m going to ask each of you 
to introduce yourself by telling the group your name, where you live, and where you 
work.ﬂ Start this process by introducing yourself, and then invite a person near you on 

the map to go next, followed by the person nearest to them. Make sure that people can 
be heard by the rest of the group, especially those further away, and ask them to speak 

up if necessary. 
Try to verbally acknowledge input from each participant Œ either with a simple ﬁThank you 

Nameﬂ, or by thanking them for being at the training. Repeating names and responding 

positively to all contributions during this activity will make participants feel more comfortable 
expressing ideas and opinions later on in the training, and help them to learn each other™s names 

more quickly.
NB: This exercise if followed immediately by the introductory exercise ‚Reasons for being here™, so don™t allow 

participants to move out of their map positions Œ start straight into the next exercise from where people are 

standing.Action planning activity: Individual action planningxlvAction planning activity: Individual action planningAims of the activity:To allow participants to reflect on the possible actions they came up with in each

for each participant) at enough distance apart that each participant can sit down without 
being too close to another person, so as to minimize distraction. The space should resemble 
a café, where participants can chose where they™d like to sit for their solo action planning 

activity.

to take back at work. You have 14 sets of notes to go back to, and only 
14 minutes. So you™ll be moving fairly quickly, spending about a minute per module. Remember 

that your action notes start at Module 3, and finish at Module 16. Are there any 
questions?ﬂ ﬁEnjoy going back through your action ideas and creating your shortlist of actions 
you would like to take back in your workplace.ﬂ Play quiet background music to encourage focus. If any conversations emerge, move 
a bit closer to the participants and, if necessary, check in on how they™re going (they 

may be unsure).3. Give time reminders at 
7 minutes (halfway), 10 minutes (4 minutes to go) and 13 minutes (1 minute to finish off). Move around the tables at a slight distance to get a 
sense of the type of action lists/plans that participants are creating.
Part 2 Œ 3 minutes
4. Congratulate participants on their synthesis of action ideas. ﬁIt looks like there are 
some great synthesized action lists that have been created. However I know that 
you™re not all super human Œ you have busy workloads and limited time. So close 

your handout folder now and in a minute, look over everything on your A4 sheets. Are there any areas of double up, or actions that could be grouped together? If 
you™ve chosen a huge action that™s not possible for you on your own or in your 

team, how could you rewrite that action so that it™s realistic for you to achieve? I™ll 
give you 3 minutes for this.ﬂ5. Ask participants to finish up at just before 3 minutes ﬁOk, please finish off any last 
adjustments you are making to your condensed action list in the next 20 secondsﬂ.Action planning activity: Individual action planningxlviiPart 3 Œ 7 minutes
6. ﬁGreat, so you should now have a list of finalized actions that you can take back in 
your workplace to make a difference on the health impacts of climate change. I™d now like to give you some time to support these actions by coming up with a more 
structured action plan.ﬂ On another piece of A4 paper please create a table that lists each action, and also 
the following things. Œ
Any resources or input that you™ll require to achieve this action
 Œ
Whom you will need to work with to achieve this; and Œ
Approval needed? If so, from whom, or by what process? Œ
A timeframe for when you will complete this action Œ
Anything else you want to note that will help you achieve this action. I™ll write these up on the whiteboard so you can refer to them in a minute. Any 
questions on the activity? Ok, you™ll have 7 minutes to create your action plan. Go for it!ﬂ
 Play quiet background music to encourage focus.

 Give time reminders at 5 minutes (2 minutes to go) and 6 minutes (1 minute to 
finish off their first version of their action plan).7. At 
7 minutes stop everyone and thank them for their hard work in generating their action plans Œ this is a fantastic outcome from the training.
 All A4 pages can now be clipped into each person™s folder for safekeeping.
Reflection activity: Key learnings from yesterday
xlixReflection activity: Key learnings from yesterday
Aims of the activity:To allow participants to reflect on their learning from the previous day, increasing 
their retention and allowing them to build on their existing learning in the coming 
day.
To warm people up at the start of the day and allow them to speak to each other 

and into the group, increasing their trust in the group and enhancing the likelihood 
of them contributing to group exercises and discussions throughout the day.
To allow everyone to warm up and become more engaged before they sit through a 

training module.Timing: 5 - 10 minutes
Resources required:Session plan or a list of the modules and key activities (site visits, panel discussion, poster presentation etc.) that were covered yesterdayInstructions for delivery1. After opening the day and welcoming people back (and perhaps asking about their 
evenings to warm them up) let them know that you™re interested in what their key 

learnings were from yesterday.
 ﬁWe had a busy day yesterday, covering X, Y and Z (list the day themes from 
yesterday and the modules and key activities that were covered.) What were the key 
learnings from yesterday for you, which were still with you when you woke up this 
morning?ﬂ ﬁI™ll get you to turn to the person next to you and share with each other some of 
your key learnings from the day, or something you learnt that really surprised you.ﬂ
2. After a few minutes (or when things seem to go quiet), draw everyone back together. 

ﬁWould some pairs like to share the key learnings that you discussed between you?ﬂ 

Seek out other responses, looking for similar or different learnings. If any group 
discussion emerges encourage it, contributing where relevant.3. At 5 Œ 10 minutes (however much time is available, or at the point the exercise 
feels complete with the group), wrap up the discussion and thank people. Bring 
them back to today and the learning theme you™ll be focusing on, and the valuable 

learning that will be building on yesterday on Day X (number).Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
lVariations for this exercise
This exercise can be done:Standing (to energize people before sitting down for much of the day), ideally in a circle or horseshoe shapeSwapping partners for shorter conversations, sharing one learning highlight or new 
piece of knowledge per conversation (similar to speed dating)As a whole group, with individuals speaking into the whole group (on later days 
in the training when the group is more warmed up, or to save time in a 5-minute 
learning reflection). Overview of the WHO Training Course for Public Health Professionals
liOverview of the WHO Training Course for Public Health 
ProfessionalsObjective and aims of the Training Package
This training course™s objectives are to improve the knowledge of health professionals on the 
associations and implications of climate change on human health and to enhance stronger 
and more efficient participation of the health sector in addressing climate change challenges.The training course is designed for public health professionals who are actively involved in the management and decision-making process related to health programmes. The course 
will also give a good foundation for nonmedical professionals involved in addressing the 
health challenges posed by climate change.The modules are developed as standalone modules, so that any one module or a combination of a few can be used for different types of audiences.Upon completion of the course participants should:(1) Comprehend the principles and basic concepts of global warming and climate 
change.(2) Understand how climate change can impact human health and know the major 
health effects from climate change.(3) Become aware of the special vulnerability of public health in the South-East Asia 
Region as a result of climate change.(4) Better analyse the health sectors™ vulnerability to climate change effects.
(5) Have an improved understanding of the epidemiologic methods used to analyse 
associations between climate change and health outcomes.(6) Be aware of adaptation and mitigation policies to manage the risks of climate 
change.(7) Develop skills in critical thinking for making management decisions to reduce the 
potential adverse impacts of climate change on health.(8) Understand the role of the health sector in national, regional and global 
negotiations and agreements for dealing with climate change mitigation and adaptation.(9) Identify knowledge gaps and know where to find further sources of information.
(10) Be in a position to help incorporate the health dimensions of climate change in 
local and national climate change work plans.(11) Be able to facilitate the training of other health professionals on the basic concepts 
of climate change and its health effects, as well as on how to carry out mitigation and adaptation in the health sector.
(12) Enhance stronger and more efficient participation of the health sector in 
addressing climate change challenges.Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
liiOutline of the Training Package
The materials for this course were originally developed by Alexander von Hildebrand, Regional Advisor Environmental Health & Climate Change, SEARO who worked in  

concert with Dr Kristie Ebi of ESS, LLC, Executive Director of the Intergovernmental Panel 

on Climate Change Working Group II, with David Mills of Stratus Consulting and with 

Dr Hisashi Ogawa, Regional Advisor WHO Regional Office for Western Œ Pacific (WPRO). 

Together they developed the course framework, identified relevant expert authors of the 

chapters on particular topics and edited the training material. The project had the financial 
support of SEARO. The training content was reviewed by a number of health experts 

working mainly in SEARO.
The current version of the training was then further developed under the direction of Payden of WHO/SEARO with funding and technical support of GIZ, Bonn. Modules were 

revised and developed by four experts as below:Responsible personTitle

The original training package was reviewed by a small group consisting of the four experts, Ms Ute Jugert and Ms Ursula Schoch from GIZ, Dr Nasir Hassan and Mr Jung Sub Yeom from WHO/WPRO, Ms Payden from WHO/SEARO and Ms Elena Prats Villalobos from 

WHO/HQ in a two-day meeting held in Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, Indonesia in 

June 2014. The work for revising the modules were divided among the four experts and 
the draft modules were then reviewed in September 2014 in Bangkok, Thailand by the 
same group. The final draft was rolled out in a biregional workshop held in Gadjah Mada 
University in January 2015. Final feedback was then incorporated. Dr David Sutherland and 

Ms Kati Thompson contributed in the final review and design of the training package.Overview of the WHO Training Course for Public Health Professionals

Hosts of the Climate Change and Health training should consult the Venue, Equipment 
and Printing Guides contained in the Training Package, under ‚
Guides for training hosts™. These set out explicit needs for the training venue that should be selected and booked for 
the training, and the equipment and printing that will need to be arranged in advance of a 

training course.Participants™ equipment
Each participant should receive the supplies listed below:Training outline (not a print off of the Session Plan for trainers)
Participant™s Handbook in a folder or binding
Notebook and ballpoint penA bag to keep all the above items.Session Plan for the trainingA draft Session Plan (timetable) has been provided as part of this Training Package. A 

suggested timetable for a four-day training course is a seven-hour working day, four hours 

in the morning and three in the afternoon. This may not always be suitable and may have 
to be modified. The Session Plan can also be adjusted for different lengths of trainings and 
participant learning needs.Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
livHowever, in any training outline organizers must allow adequate time for both delivery 
of elements and the following aspects:Exercises to help participants get to know each other
 Œ Group learning and ongoing 
working relationships will be one of the most valuable results of the training.
Group exercises Œ Participants will struggle to learn within long periods of one-way 
didactic learning, particularly with detailed technical material which is likely new to 
them. Group exercises break up the delivery mode and help participants interpret 
and embed learning into their existing knowledge base.Poster sessions
 Œ As well as the information contained in the training slides, 
participants will bring with them valuable experience and insight into how climate 
change is affecting health in their own contexts, and what programmes are being 
designed to respond. Allowing time for sharing between participants at a poster 
and discussion session will allow for valuable sharing of experience and ongoing 
relationships.Reflection and action planning exercises Œ One of the key goals of the training is to influence the knowledge and practice of health professionals. Time for 

participants to reflect on how they will apply what they have just learnt in their own 
context, and make specific plans for action at the individual, organization, region or 
country level is therefore essential.Pre- and post-testing
 Œ Testing participants before and after the training using the 

same questions allows for assessment of the change in participants™ knowledge as 
a result of the training. In addition to qualitative evaluation and action planning 

outcomes, this helps show the outcomes investment in the training programme has 
resulted in.Evaluation both during and after the course Œ In order to improve the training and its delivery, it™s important to ask participants for feedback at the end of Day 1 (using 

the exercise ‚Day 1 Evaluation Activity - Post It Wall
™). This allows for short-term changes to the design, delivery and practical logistics of Days 2 Œ 5 that will benefit 
both the participants and trainers. Evaluation at the end of the training then allows 
for assessment of outcomes from the training, as well as gathering ideas for ongoing 

improvement of the Training Package and trainer delivery.
Ample break time, ideally including fresh air breaks outside Œ to keep participants energized and refreshed throughout long training days.Extra time for unforeseen situations, such as getting involved into working groups, delays in transportation to the place of training and so on.Time for further discussion of topics important to the group
, or possible additional action by the participants.Training style
Accessible Œ The training™s purpose is to help change the knowledge and practice of health professionals regarding climate change. Therefore all concepts presented in the training need 
to be made accessible to participants so that no one is alienated by technical or academic Overview of the WHO Training Course for Public Health Professionals
lvconcepts that they™re not familiar with. At all points, but particularly in dense or technical 
sections of the training package, check in with participants on their understanding. Define 

terms (using the glossary where needed), explain concepts in simple language, and describe 
the relevance and significance of the concept for health professionals on the ground. The 
Trainer Guides have pointers on areas of training modules that may be challenging for 

participants to comprehend, and ways to make them more accessible.Practical and real world focused Œ Where possible, refer academic concepts and models back to real world scenarios and case studies. What effect is this trend having? What 
have other countries, regions or hospitals done to respond to this? What can these health 
professionals do? Ensure that enough time is left for all action-oriented activities designed 

into the Session Plan and training slides to be carried out, as these will help participants to 
translate their learning into practical action.Engaging Œ In order for participants to continue to learn over a multi-day training made 
up of long days, the style of training used must engage them. Avoid a one-way didactic 

delivery style where only you as the trainer are heard for the entire Training Module Œ this 

will make it almost possible for participants to stay engaged for a full 60 minute session.Follow notes provided in the training slides and accompanying activity guides to involve 
participants as much as possible throughout a module, using questions, exercises, humour, 

case studies, videos, stretch breaks, challenges and stories from your own experience. 
Remember that our brains can only concentrate for a certain period Œ ideally no longer than 
40 minutes in one stretch without moving, carrying out an activity or having a brief break. 

It™s much more important that you reengage participants with a short stretch or exercise, 
rather than ‚pushing through™ to complete a presentation.
Use your body language and voice effectively to help engage people. Move around the room to provide variety, using a slide changer in your hand or pocket so that you can 

speak from anywhere. Avoid carrying outline notes with you (leave them on a table nearby) 

so that you can use your hands, arms and body to emphasise your points and provide visual 
interest. Varying your tone of voice and the volume with which you speak will also keep 

people engaged.In the Session Planning process, ensure that training modules are swapped between at least two trainers to provide variety and interest for participants. Ideally few, if any, 

sequential modules will be delivered in a row by the same trainer. If this is needed due to 

one trainer having expertise in the subject of sequential modules, schedule a break between 
modules and encourage the trainer to bring new energy to the second module delivered so 
that participants don™t become disengaged.
Recognizing participants™ knowledge and experience Œ In dividing modules between trainers in the Session Plan, trainers should work to their strengths, opting for modules on 
topics they have some familiarity with. However, trainers do not need to be total experts on 

the module topic. Remember that participants bring with them a wide variety of knowledge 
and experience, whether through formal study, practical work in the field, or a combination 

of both. Allow regular opportunities for participants to share their experience with the 
group or with each other directly Œ in many cases learning from the proven practice of other 
participants will be of equal or greater value to those attending than the designed training 
material.Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
lviResponsive to participants™ needs Œ A suggested Session Plan has been provided in this Training Package, indicating an order for Modules 1 Œ 16 that would flow well 
sequentially. This order is featured in the last slide of each set of training module slides, with 

a ‚Coming next™ slide. Activities and interactive sessions such as poster displays and field trips 
have also been included. However training organisers are welcome to alter the suggested 
order of training modules, based on available time and participant interest.Once training has begun, trainers can also get a sense of participant interests in the opening exercise ‚Reasons for being here™. Feel free to then steer emphasis towards learning 

areas that are most common for participants, so that learning goals are achieved.Trainers should also touch base as a group at the end of each training day to review 
how things are going and any changes that may help meet participants™ needs and interests.For any questions on the delivery of the Climate Change and Health Training Package, 
please contact Payden at WHO SEARO: payden@who.int

Purpose of the activity:This ‚pulse check™ evaluation exercise allows you to quickly get a sense of how the training is going 
for participants at the end of Day 1. Participants will often be reticent in sharing what they think 

about the training set up with organizers directly, so the confidential format can provide valuable 

ideas that allow you and the training team to make any adjustments to Day 2 (and following days) 
rather than waiting until Day 5 for evaluation forms to be submitted. Required resources:Post its (enough for 5 per person)
Whiteboard, drawn up with two wide columns and a ‚smiley™ and ‚frowny™ face
Preparation:On a whiteboard, draw one dividing vertical line, dividing the board into up two wide columns. At 
the top of the left column draw a large ‚smiley™ face, and on the right a ‚frowny™ face, with a question 

mark by its head or in a thought bubble. Place the whiteboard towards the back of the room. If a whiteboard on wheels is not available, draw each of the faces on flipchart paper and blu tak them next to each other on the back wall, close to the exit.Place a pile of post it notes of different colours (enough for 5 per participant) on each table, or give them to another trainer to distribute across the tables as you™re introducing the exercise.

lxvPre- and post-training testing question and answers 
(for WHO marking and evaluation only)Question 1 (Module 1): What is the difference between climate variability and climate 

change?Answer: Climate variability is short-term fluctuations around the average weather, and cli-
mate change operates over at least three decades.Question 2 (Module 2): Name three risks to health that occur currently and are 
predicted to arise in the Western Pacific and South East Asia regions due to climate 

events.Answers from the following options: undernutrition, vector-borne disease, heat-related 
mortality, water-borne disease.
Question 3 (Module 3): What does the concept of ‚cobenefits™ or ‚win-win™ strategies 
mean in relation to climate change and human health?Answer: If emissions are reduced (mitigation), health of the human population is improved.Question 4 (Module 4): Explain the advantages and disadvantages of health modelling.Answer: Advantages: Provides best explanation or prediction of likely health impacts based on current knowledgeDisadvantages: Cannot predict what will actually happen, due to unexpected changes or other unknown factorsQuestion 5 (Module 5): What impacts do high ambient temperatures have on human health in a changing climate?Answers from the following options: Heat stress, heat stroke, hospitalization for cardiovas-
cular and respiratory disease, deathQuestion 6 (Module 6): What are some of the extreme weather and climate events that 
affect Asia and the Pacific?
Answers from the following options: Floods, storms, storm surges, cyclones and droughts.Question 7 (Module 7): Describe the effects of climate change on vector-borne diseases.

Answer (one of): (1) Climate change may increase the range or abundance of both animal reservoirs 
and arthropod vectors (e.g. Schistosomiasis in China and malaria in the Kenyan 
Highlands).(2) Climate change may prolong the length of the transmission cycles of disease or 
the transmission season of diseases (e.g. West Nile virus in North America has an 

amplification cycle involving mosquitoes and avian reservoir hosts).Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
lxvi(3) Climate may increase the likelihood of successful importation of disease vectors 
and animal host reservoirs (e.g. the global spread of Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes 
albopictus, which has been linked to the sale of used tires around the world, was 
linked to an outbreak of Chikungunya virus).(4) Climate change may increase animal disease risks and are likely to increase the risk 
of human disease as well.Question 8 (Module 8): Explain how the amount of rainfall is related with occurrence of 
water-borne diseases.
Answer: (1) Heavy rainfall is usually related with increased incidence of water-borne diseases. 
Heavy rain will bring sewage and contaminants from human excreta into drinking water sources. However, depending on the mode of transmission and biologic 

characteristics of each pathogen, there can be a delay between rainfall and disease 
outcome. Diseases with longer incubation periods such as Hepatitis A will have 
longer delay, including reporting delay. Some diseases that have a natural reservoir, 

such as Cholera, may also demonstrate a longer lag between rainfall and disease 
occurrence.(2) Less rainfall over a long-term period will push the community toward a water stress 
situation, in which water usage for washing and daily cleaning are less available. 
Prolonged water shortage may predispose people toward more opportunities to 
transmit faecal-orally transmitted diseases through person-to-person transmission.
Question 9 (Module 9): Explain possible pathways that climate change can affect 
malnutrition of children in a specific local area: i) in Pacific Island countries, OR 

ii) Mongolian steppes?Answers (hypothetical representations, to be added to with participant understanding of local context)Pacific Island countries
(1) Sea-level rise will restrict and accelerate salination of the freshwater reserve of the 
atoll island. ŒAs the freshwater source dies out, plantations will become less productive and 
food resources get scarce. ŒDecreased food availability can be aggravated by lower food accessibility of 
the vulnerable population such as children and the poor. Sociocultural and 
socioeconomic status of the local island can interact with food accessibility in 
contrasting ways, either worsening or improving access to food.(2) Higher sea level exposes the atoll, leading to higher susceptibility to storms and 
tsunami. ŒNatural disasters may worsen food availability and distribution issues. 
Relocation of the population will aggravate the food availability and balance, 
with deficits in the specific nutrients that are needed for the growth of 
children.Pre- and post-training testing question and answers
lxvii(3) Depending on food resources, more imported food may distort the nutrient 
balance, which can drive health toward malnutrition.ORMongolian steppe(1) Extreme weather events and desertification
(2) Accentuated climate variability may be related with more frequent and more 
severe extreme weather events such as dzud in winter and flooding in summer. 
Prolonged drought may facilitate desertification of the steppe near the margin of 
the Gobi desert.(3) Desertification and extreme weather events immediately bring about the massive 
loss of livestock, both a food source and economic basis of the households, 
predisposing people to undernutrition, especially children. Less money means less 
milk and weaning food products for the infant and young children. Less livestock 
means less dairy food material for the growing children.(4) Acute effects:
 ŒFood availability and accessibility as well as nutritional balance drives 
undernutrition of children, which is more prominent in younger children and 
infants, who have more critical need for essential nutrients and calories.(5) Long-term effects:
 ŒRelocation or migration into periphery areas of a city makes households rely 
more on the market for food, making nutrition more sensitive to the economic 
status of the household. Amount and balance of nutrients, especially those for 
children, can be affected.Question 10 (Module 10): How could a changing climate affect respiratory health?
Answer: Through changing concentrations of ozone and particulate matter, both of serious 
concern in Asia and the Pacific.
Question 11 (Module 11): Name three causes of vulnerability in the context of climate 
change.Answers from the following options:Geographical locationSocioeconomic statusHealth statusGovernancePreparednessPhysical environmentPolicies
Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
lxviiiQuestion 12 (Module 12): What is the main goal of climate change adaptation in the 
health sector?Answer: To prepare for, and effectively respond to the health risks of climate change.
Question 13 (Module 13): Which economic sector directly emits the largest amount of 
greenhouse gases?Answer: Agriculture, Forestry (and other land use)
Question 14 (Module 14): Why should health feature strongly in international climate 
change negotiations?Answer: Health should be central to considerations of adaptation (because people are already being affected) and mitigation (because most energy and environmental decisions have health implications).Question 15 (Module 15): What are the two basic approaches for reducing the health 
risks of the extreme weather and climate events in Asia?Answer: 1) Disaster risk management; and 2) Adaptation.Question 16 (Module 16): Why should we in the health sector communicate widely 
around climate change and health?Answers from the following options (and other possibilities):Because climate change is a threat to human health and wellbeingThe health sector is responsible for doing this; climate change is an intersectoral issueClimate change and health still requires further advocacy effortsImpacts are already being experiencedMany people currently have low levels of understanding on the health impacts of 
climate changeWe need to prepare for the health impacts of climate change
Everyone needs to be involved in reducing our contribution to climate change.Pre-training testing

Resource requirements:Large open space at the back of the training roomWhiteboard, whiteboard markers and scribe to capture two brainstorms/listsTiming: 15 minutes
Instructions for deliveryNB: This activity follows on directly from the Human Map1. Participants are standing in the map they created in the first introductory exercise. 
Acknowledge how far participants have come to be here Œ as everyone can see on the map, and the time they™re taking out of their busy schedules. 
 ﬁBut you™ve obviously come here for a reason! I™d like you to turn to a person near 
you on the map, introduce yourselves, and tell each other why you™ve come to the training. Take turns doing this Œ you™ll have 30 seconds each.ﬂ
2. Ring a bell at 30 seconds, letting people know to swap over. At 1 minute stop this 
first round of conversations and ask them to find a new partner, someone from a 

different country or region from themselves. ﬁOk, thanks for sharing with your first partner. In a minute I™m going to ask you to 
now cross the map and find someone from an entirely different country and possibly 

even region from yourself. Again, introduce yourselves, and tell each other 
what you™re hoping to get out of this training programme. You™ll have a minute each 
this time Œ I™ll ring a bell to remind you when to swap over.ﬂ
3. Ring a bell at 1 minute, letting people know to swap over. At 2 minutes stop this 
second round of conversations and ask them to explore the map and find a third 
partner, someone from a different country or region from themselves.
 ﬁIn this last round of meeting, I™d like you to share in your pair 
what you™d like to be able to do back in your work as a result of this training. So, find your new partner, remembering to introduce yourselves.ﬂ
4. Ring a bell at 1 minute, letting people know to swap over. At 2 minutes stop this 
third and final round of conversations by thanking people for exploring the map Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
lxxiiand sharing some of the reasons why they™ve come to the training with their new 
colleagues.5. Ask participants to gather around you in a semi-circle, hear a whiteboard. ﬁIt sounds 
like there were some great conversations going on. I™m curious to hear some of the 
reasons that were discussed.ﬂ ﬁCan I ask you to share some of the reasons you™ve discussed, and we™ll write these 
up on the whiteboard here?ﬂ Note that you™ll have 10 minutes for this section, so keep the responses to the two brainstorms to 5 

minutes each.Visual brainstorm 1 (5 minutes)ﬁFirst off, what are
 you hoping to get out of this training programme? Can someone start us off? This can just be an idea or sentence.ﬂ Summarize ideas that are shared one 
by one into a single phrase, making sure they™re captured by the scribe in a brainstorm or 

list format. If ideas are mentioned multiple times, encourage the scribe to emphasize that 
point with a tick or underline. Seek responses from different areas of the semi-circle to get 

a range of responses from the group with ﬁWhat about others, what are you hoping to get 

out of this training?ﬂ, although in the 15-minute timeframe not everyone will be able to give 
a response. Do respond to any hopes that will not be covered or achieved by the training, 

ensuring that any false expectations don™t persist.
ﬁThanks everyone Œ those are some great hopes you have for what you™ll get out of this 
week. Please keep these in mind as we go through all of the training content, so you stay 
engaged and motivated in why you™re here.ﬂ

lxxvClimate Change and Health Training Package: Venue Guide
OverviewThe success of this Climate Change and Health training relies in large part on our ability to engage health professionals in an engaging learning process that meets their needs. 
The training package is designed to achieve enhanced learning outcomes and value for 
participants by running interactive activities, small group exercises, sharing of best practice 
through poster displays and site visits, and interactive games to let the participants get to 
know each other.
This style is important not just for achieving learning outcomes, but because training is run over long successive days, requiring participants to stay engaged beyond all usual 
concentration limits (generally 40 minutes maximum for adults).For these reasons, we rely heavily on a training venue that supports interactive teaching 
and learning methods, flexible delivery, and the ability for participants to maintain energy 

levels and concentration for long periods.All of the following requirements are therefore important in selecting and booking a training venue for a WHO Climate Change and Health training.
Training venue requirements
Venue requirement
Reason requiredOpen room with no fixed furniture (not a lecture theatre)Large enough for participants to walk around in easily, and
 big enough for two adjoining working spaces to be set 
up within the same room, with space between the two sections:1) Round tables at the front of the room, arranged in a semi-circle facing a large white wall or screen for 
projecting onto. (Square or rectangular tables can also 
be used). Each table should seat an even number of 
participants, likely 4 or 6, without restricted view of the 
screen. Allow 3 Œ 4 metres of room in front and behind 
the semicircle of tables for stand-up activities.2) Tables
 (any shape) with chairs around them at the back, for participants to do small group activities at.Note that a room with fixed seating should not be used, such as a lecture theatre with rows of fold down seats, as this will 
not allow for planned interactive activities and exercises.To be able to run teaching, interactive and 

small group activities within one space in a 
time efficient manner.
So that participants can move easily around the space and share information between 
sessions.Good natural light from windows facing directly into the roomTo keep participants awake over long days of 

concentration!Windows that open, air vents, fans or air conditioning that is adjustable within the room to maintain a high volume of 
air flow and oxygenTo keep participants awake over long days of 

concentration!Close proximity to toiletsFor participants to access during activities 

without wasting timeClose to outdoor accessFor quick access to fresh air breaks, or for 

activities to be run outside (if appropriate)Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules

Instructions for delivery of Module 1As the first module of the training, Module 1 is important in ensuring participants feel 
confident in core concepts related to climate change. Keep in mind that these will be 

new terms and ideas for some people, and your own knowledge is likely far greater than 
those in the group you are training. Move slowly through the material, using questions and 

observations of faces and body language to ensure understanding of all participants before 
moving on. The exercise on slides 27 Œ 28 gives participants time to explore for themselves the likely impacts of climate change. This is also the first interactive small group exercise within 
the training content. Give this the full 10 minutes or longer if required, so that people warm 
up to working in groups, and the connections between climate change and health become 
clearer for everyone.Module 1 contains two videos:1. Walk the Dog Œ played on slide 7
2.  Climate 101 Œ played on slide 10
To play the videos as embedded video files you will need to ensure before you begin 
the presentation that you have an Internet connection. Trainer Guide

Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
10First, it™s really important to understand the difference between weather and climate. 
CLICK slide changer to animate each definition
Climate is what you expect, but weather is what you actually get on a day-to-day basis. 
Weather and climate are part of a continuum. 

The World Meteorological Organization designates particular weather stations for 
collecting data on a range of weather variables for determining the ﬁclimate normalﬂ or 
the 30-year average of weather variables in a particular location. Projecting what could 
happen over a 30-year time periods is, in some ways, less challenging than forecasting 
what will happen tomorrow or next week. Weather, then, is the day-to-day variability in 

climate that we experience.The climate in a particular location is defined as the 30-year averages of weather variables, such as temperature and precipitation. Most of the research on the health impacts of 
climate variability and change uses the period 1961-1990 as the climate baseline. Climate 
scientists analyse data against this baseline.So to summarise again, weather can change from minute to minute, hour to hour and day to day. 
Climate is the average of this weather calculated over a 30-year time period.  
Q (rhetorical): Does that make sense?
CLICK - Climate variability is the term used to describe short-term variations around average weather. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are particularly important 
expressions of climate variability for human health. As you will hear in other modules. Climate termsClimateis what we expectWeatheris what we 
getClimate variabilit

11ENSO events are associated with adverse health outcomes in many regions. For example, 
in some regions of Asia and the Pacific, ENSO events are associated with drought. In other 

regions, ENSO events are associated with flooding. Both extreme events can cause direct 

and indirect health impacts.CLICK - Climate change is the change in long-term averages of the daily weather and 
operates over decades or longer. It is projected using increasingly sophisticated earth 
system models (ESMs). Climate projections are based on scenarios of drivers of greenhouse 
gas emissions, including, at a minimum, demographic change (including patterns of 

change), economic development, and technological development. These scenarios 
project emissions of greenhouse gases. These emission concentrations are then input into 
the ESMs to project possible future climate. ESMs do not predict what will occur; they 
project how temperature and precipitation could change under different assumptions 
of greenhouse gas emissions. The future is inherently uncertain, so projections are not 
ﬁpredictionsﬂ.Remember that these terms and many others are located in the glossary in your training handout folder.

10Climate 101 -VideoModule 1: Introduction to weather, climate & climate change
17Let™s now look at some historical climate data.The slide shows the temperature variation in Greenland over 100 000 years, determined by data from an ice core sample. First a note on how climatologists analyse historic trends. 

Because climate is always changing, there is no natural baseline against which to compare. 

Therefore, trend analyses are not appropriate for determining long-term trends. Instead, 

analyses start by choosing a baseline period. The baseline for many climate studies is 
1961-90 (a climate normal). The weather data are normalized to that baseline and plotted 
to show deviations (anomalies) over time.Several points should be clear from the figure. Climate is always changing, with often very 
large swings in temperature over relatively short time periods (on a geologic scale). One 
can imagine the impacts on societies if temperature patterns returned to that degree of 
variability.
Another point is that the last 10 000 years are unique in the climate record: they have been relatively stable. The earth is coming out of this period of stability.

18This figure shows the last 17 000 years. The earth started warming out of the last ice age about 15 000 years ago. After warming considerably, temperatures fell during a period 

called the Younger Dryas. After several thousand years, the earth started warming again 

and continued to warm until about 10 000 years ago, when temperatures over Greenland 
(and for the rest of the world) became relatively stable. The Medieval Warm Period and 

Little Ice Age are marked. Although the Little Ice Age was quite small compared with the 
rest of the climate history, it had significant direct and indirect impacts on human health, 

including from reductions in crop yields leading to food insecurity.

considerable increase in both temperature and concentrations of carbon dioxide is 
obvious, as is the close correlation between these two. Note the temperatures are in degrees Fahrenheit. In Celsius, the scale is 13.3 to 14.7.

20The figure provides a better sense of the magnitude of the change since the start of the Industrial Revolution. The black line shows a 1000 year segment of global mean 
temperatures from control simulations of a coupled oceanŒatmosphere climate model 
over many centuries, with no changes in the external drivers of climate such as increases in 
greenhouse gas concentrations or in solar output. On top of this are plotted observed global mean temperature changes from 1850 to 2008 (in red) from a climate model run by the Hadley Centre in the UK. Uncertainties (yellow

24The trends that we™ve just looked at have a wide range of consequences globally. Let™s 
finish off this section on trends and projections for climate change by focusing on climate 
change in South-East Asia specifically.
This map shows five hazards Œ cyclones, floods, droughts, landslides and sea-level rise Œ and plots their average risk on the South-East Asian region. This has used data from 1980Œ
2000 to calculate the average annual frequency of cyclones, floods and droughts between 
1980 and 2000, and included the degree of landslide risk and the extent of a 5-metre 
inundation zone due to sea-level rise.FOR TRAINER INFO
 - Plotting of averages in cyclones, floods, and droughts is done in terms 
of average annual frequency of occurrence from 1980Œ2000, the degree of landslide risk, 
and the extent of a 5-metre inundation zone due to sea-level rise.Data on climate hazards are taken from the PREVIEW database of UNEP, while the sea-
level rise inundation zone map is produced from CReSIS.Source: Yusfu & Francisco, 2009. Climate Change Vulnerability Mapping for Southeast Asia

25The hotspots in South-East Asia include the north-western and Mekong region of Vietnam, 
the coastal regions of Vietnam facing the South China Sea, Bangkok and its surrounding 

areas in Thailand, practically all the regions of the Philippines, and the western and eastern 
parts of Java Island, Indonesia.19Multiple climate hazard map of South-East
AsiaSource: Yusuf & Francisco (2009)hEastAapofSouthhSAsiaAClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
26An overall understanding of vulnerability extends our knowledge from the maps you have just seen that focused on exposure. Responding to climate change is not just about knowing the 
exposure to hazards, but also recognising to what degree a region or country is sensitive to such 
exposure, and to what degree the population has the capacity to adapt.This vulnerability map was developed by averaging the indicators of exposure (multiple hazard risk exposure), sensitivity (human and ecological) and adaptive capacity across the countries 
and regions in South-East Asia. The vulnerable areas were identified by ranking the regions 
according to the index and dividing the list into four equal parts. The geographical areas that 
fell into the fourth quartile were considered the vulnerable areas. The most vulnerable areas include: all the regions of the Philippines; the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam; almost all the regions of Cambodia; North and East Lao PDR; the Bangkok region 

of Thailand; and West Sumatra, South Sumatra, West Java, and East Java of Indonesia. The 

exposure of the Philippines is more extreme compared to other South-East Asian countries in 
that it is not only exposed to tropical cyclones (especially in the northern and eastern parts of 
the country) but also to many other climate hazards particularly floods (such as in central Luzon 

and southern Mindanao), landslides (due to the terrain of the country) and droughts. In general, these results confirm our general assumptions that the most vulnerable regions in South-East Asia include the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam and Bangkok due to their exposure 

to sea-level rise, and the northern part of the Philippines due to its exposure to tropical 
cyclones.20Climate change vulnerability map of South-East AsiaSource: Yusuf & Francisco (2009)thEastmapoofSoutthofAsiatModule 1: Introduction to weather, climate & climate change
27As discussed in the previous slide, adaptive capacity is one of the three elements that comprise vulnerability, or risk. 
Adaptive capacity can be defined as: The ability of systems, institutions, humans, and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond 
to consequences (IPCC 5AR). Here is an example of adaptive capacity of the South-East Asia region.
Overall, areas with relatively high adaptive capacity are in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. 
Areas with relatively low adaptive capacity are mostly found in Cambodia and Lao PDR.To sum up these three slides we have just seen and in order to shape policy and planning, 
it™s important to know your own country™s vulnerability or risk, which is comprised of 

adaptive capacity, exposure and sensitivity.

Let™s now look at the health risks associated with climate variability and change.22The health risks of climate variability & changeModule 1: Introduction to weather, climate & climate change
29This diagram shows the risk associated with a changing climate arising from the interaction of three factors: the hazards associated with a changing climate; the human and/or natural 
systems exposed to those hazards; and the vulnerability of these systems. Drivers of these 
factors include changes in climate variability and change, and socioeconomic processes, 
including adaptation and mitigation.This model comes from the IPCC Working Group II 5th assessment report.

30Although more than a decade old, this slide from the Ministry of Health in Guatemala is an example of the seasonality of many health outcomes. One doesn™t need to understand 

Spanish to see that infectious diseases typically occur only during certain months of the 
year. Any health outcome that is seasonal may be affected by climate change. The extent 

to which the incidence or geographic range of a seasonal disease could be affected by 
climate change will be determined by how sensitive it is to weather variables. Although not 
all diseases are seasonal because of temperature and precipitation patterns, most infectious 
diseases are.24Many health outcomes are seasonal–

31The figure illustrates the various exposure pathways by which climate change affects health. Climate change can affect human health:CLICK - Directly through weather variables such as heat and storms, or from 
changes in ocean acidification; CLICK - Indirectly through changes in natural systems that affect disease vectors; 
and CLICK - Through pathways heavily mediated through human systems, such as 
undernutrition. Source: IPCC Working Group II AR5 (2014)

35In terms of managing these impacts, there are two main policy responses to managing the risks of climate change: adaptation and mitigation. Mitigation actions reduce greenhouse gas emissions or enhance the sinks (e.g. sources that 
take up carbon dioxide, such as soil and rocks). 
CLICK to animate. Adaptation is a term used in the climate change community to describe the process of adjustment of human and natural systems to actual or expected climate change. This is similar to the idea of prevention in public health.29Policy responses to manage the risks of climate change1. MitigationA human intervention to reducethe sources or

AdaptationTerm used by the climate change community to describe the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate & its e˜ects.Seeks to moderate harm or exploit bene˜cial opportunitiesBasically, means preventionfrom the perspective of public health.Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
36Health systems have been managing, with various degrees of success, the health risks 
associated with temperature and precipitation patterns for more than 150 years. For 

nearly all health outcomes of concern, policies and programmes are in place to prevent 
and reduce health burdens. This means that health systems are well placed to incorporate 
concerns about climate change into existing programmes. This slide illustrates some of the 
opportunities.Health system policies and programmes are traditionally grouped into primary, secondary, 
and tertiary prevention. The goal of primary prevention is to reduce exposures. This 
slide illustrates a few of the many opportunities to reduce exposure to higher ambient 
temperature, changing precipitation patterns, and sea-level rise. The goal of secondary 
prevention is to prevent the onset of adverse health outcomes once exposure has 
occurred. The examples listed are core programs in many ministries of health. The goal 
of tertiary prevention is response and/or treatment once an adverse health outcome is 
manifest. Most of the activities in this area fall within health care services and emergency 
response.Source: Ebi KL. Public health responses to the risks of climate variability and change in the United States.

39Here is a short overview of some of the many roles we believe the health sector can play nationally and internationally around climate change. CLICK to animate three summary points, reading each one.

Overall, health systems need to be strengthened to ensure that communities and regions are resilient to the risks of climate variability and change, with strategies, polices and 
measures explicitly incorporating climate change and with close cooperation across 
sectors. The health sector also needs to assess the health benefits and potential harms 
of policies, measures and technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other 
climate pollutants. Finally, the health sector needs to support national and international 

negotiations to ensure that agreements promote health.33Role of the health sectorEnhance resilience

41The health sector is already starting to play an important leadership role. In August 2014, WHO held its first international conference on health and climate; the photo is of some 
of the delegates. It was attended by 360 participants, including health and environment 
ministers of WHO Member States, senior civil servants, technical experts, UN agencies, 
NGOs, chief executives from health authorities and relevant private sector entities.The meeting discussed: the state of climate science, particularly as it relates to health; the public health response to climate change; health resilience; health benefits and health 
promotion while mitigating climate change; and the economics of health and climate 
change. Throughout the conference, participants discussed linking climate, sustainable 
development and health policy.
The meeting produced a draft summary that recognizes the need to strengthen health resilience to climate change and the opportunity to make gains in public health through 
well-planned mitigation measures. The document also recognizes policy gaps and 
next steps. A final version was presented at the 2014 Climate Summit in New York in 

September. The conclusions are also intended to serve as input to the 21st session of the 

Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC 

COP 21), the post-2015 development agenda discussions, and the 2nd Hyogo Framework 

for Action on Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015.We look forward to more of you being involved in understanding and managing the health

52This map is to remind us of how large our regions are, and that climate change will effect the regions differently, depending on exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity (we will revisit these terms in the 

next slide).The South-East Asia (SEA) Region consists of eleven countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Democratic People™s 
Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Timor-Leste.
The Western Pacific Region stretches over a vast area, from China in the north and west, to New Zealand 
in the south, and French Polynesia in the east. One of the most diverse of the WHO regions, the Western 

Pacific, constitutes some of the world™s least-developed countries as well as the most rapidly emerging 

economies. It includes highly developed countries such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of 
Korea and Singapore; and fast growing economies such as China and Viet Nam.
There are 37 countries and areas in the Western Pacific Region. 

The burden of communicable diseases is still high. Dengue continues to pose a major and increasing public health problem. Chikungunya fever is re-emerging and outbreaks of Nipah virus infections are 

being reported. Drug-resistant malaria has spread.
Countries have made significant progress toward increasing water supply coverage, but sanitation coverage remains low. As a consequence, diarrhoeal cause substantial mortality. Public awareness of food 

hygiene related to food standards is limited, as is the food safety surveillance system. More than 70% of 
workers are not covered by occupational health provisions.Source: http://www.who.int/about/regions/en/
WHO Regions:SEA & WP Regions 6Module 2: Population health & climate change
53This climate change vulnerability map is a useful reminder of how vulnerable our region is Œ unfortunately only part of the Western Pacific and part of South-East Asia is included in this map.
You™ll recall that responding to climate change is not just about knowing the exposure to hazards, 
but also recognising to what degree a region or country is sensitive to such exposure, and to what 
degree the population has the capacity to adapt. This is known as ‚vulnerability™.
[This vulnerability map was developed by averaging the indicators of exposure (multiple hazard risk exposure), sensitivity (human and ecological) and adaptive capacity across the countries and 
regions in SE Asia. The vulnerable areas were identified by ranking the regions according to the 
index and dividing the list into four equal parts. The geographical areas that fell into the fourth 
quartile were considered the vulnerable areas]. So, again, the most vulnerable areas include: all the regions of the Philippines; the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam; almost all the regions of Cambodia; North and East Lao PDR; the Bangkok 

region of Thailand; and West Sumatra, South Sumatra, West Java, and East Java of Indonesia. The 

exposure of the Philippines is more extreme compared to other Southeast Asian countries in that it 
is not only exposed to tropical cyclones (especially in the northern and eastern parts of the country) 
but also to many other climate hazards particularly floods (such as in central Luzon and southern 

Mindanao), landslides (due to the terrain of the country), and droughts. In general, these results confirm our general assumptions that the most vulnerable regions in Southeast Asia include the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam and Bangkok due to their exposure to 

sea-level rise, and the northern part of the Philippines due to its exposure to tropical cyclones.7Climate change vulnerability map of SE AsiaSource: Yusuf & Francisco (2009)Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
54So to put a face to the map of SEA and the WP we just saw - the most vulnerable are those who have less capacity to cope: the poor, children, women, the elderly, disabled and sick 

people, slum dwellers, the landless and marginalized, informal open air workers, but also 
the displaced communities and individuals.Low-income countries and areas where malnutrition is widespread, the level of education 
is poor and with weak infrastructures will have the most difficulty adapting to climate 
change and related health hazards. The populations considered to be at greatest risk are 
those living in small islands, low-lying and coastal areas, mountainous regions, water-



in delta regions in the SEA Region. The most vulnerable of populations in the Region will be the poor because they have fewer resources to adapt to the rapid changes of the natural environment whose livelihood 
is dependent upon. In rural areas, women are increasingly becoming household heads and 
have the double burden of social reproduction and agricultural work as their husbands 
leave the rural areas in search of work in urban centres.Mountain people, communities living in remote areas, slums dwellers in and around mega cities, islanders, and fisher folk will be deeply affected. But it is women, elderly groups, 
poor communities, children, the disabled, and ethnic minorities who have the least coping 
and recovering capacity and who, therefore, will be the most physically, socially, and 

psychologically vulnerable.8AþAdverse health impacts will be greatest in low-income 
countries. Those at greater risk include, in all countries, the urban poor, the elderly & children, traditional societies, subsistence farmers, & coastal populations (high con˜dence).AÿIPCC AR4 (2007) & IPCC AR5 (2013)Module 2: Population health & climate change
55In terms of understanding how exactly climate change affects health, and increases vulnerability, it is helpful to look at this diagram. 
(CLICK to show the diagram).This diagram from the IPCC AR5 report shows three primary exposure pathways by which 
climate change affects health:1.  Directly through weather variables such as heat and storms;
2.  Indirectly through natural systems such as disease vectors; and

3.  Pathways heavily mediated through human systems such as undernutrition. 
The yellow box indicates the moderating influences of local environmental conditions on how climate change exposure pathways occur in a particular population. The orange box indicates that the extent to which the three categories of exposure translate to actual health burden is moderated by such factors as background public health 
and socioeconomic conditions, and adaptation measures. The green arrows at the bottom indicate that there may be feedback mechanisms, positive or negative, between societal infrastructure, public health, and adaptation measures and 
climate change itself.

56So we™ve looked at the SE Asia and Western Pacific regions, and how generally climate 
change affects human health and vulnerability.
Now let™s look in more detail at some of the specific impacts of climate change on human health.10Impacts of climate 

on health 
(IPCC AR5 report)
              
           
  Module 2: Population health & climate change
57Some of the impacts of climate change on health include– (read)We™ll look at each of these in turn in the following slides.

Lake Outburst FloodSea-level riseClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
58This is an example of the tables featured in the latest IPCC AR5 report from the chapter on the Asia Pacific region that set out specific impacts of climate change on health. 
The figure outlines the key risks and the climatic drivers for these, indicates the adaptation issues and prospects, and suggests a timeframe for risks for current and high adaptation. 
We can see that in each example, the lowest risks are faced when adaptation occurs in the 

present Œ i.e. now. We face higher risks for adaptation when we delay our responses.
We™ll now look at these impacts one by one.
12Module 2: Population health & climate change
59Let™s take drought as our first example. Drought is listed here as a key risk Œ particularly the increase risk of drought-related water and food shortage causing malnutrition. This climate 
change risk is indicated with ‚high confidence™, meaning that there is a good degree of 

certainty that this will in fact occur. 
Adaptation issues to respond to drought and corresponding effects include disaster prepardeness, such as early-warning systems, and local coping strategies.Source: IPCC AR5 Asia Report
[SUPPORTING BACKGROUND INFOKey risks are identified based on assessment of the literature and expert judgments, with 
supporting evaluation of evidence and agreement in the referenced chapter sections. 
Each key risk is characterized as very low, low, medium, high, or very high. Risk levels are 

presented for the near-term era of committed climate change (here, for 2030-2040), in 

which projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially 
across emissions scenarios. Risk levels are also presented for the longer-term era of climate 

options (here, for 2080-2100), for global mean temperature increase of 2°C and 4°C above 
preindustrial levels. For each timeframe, risk levels are estimated for the current state 

of adaptation and for a hypothetical highly adapted state. As the assessment considers 
potential impacts on different physical, biological, and human systems, risk levels should 
not necessarily be used to evaluate relative risk across key risks. Relevant climate variables 
are indicated by symbols.]13DroughtClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
60This image shows the impacts of drought through two lenses Œ community and health. Drought can be seen here as a risk factor for complex public health impacts Œ ranging from 
infectious diseases and malnutrition to other health risks such as low birth weight.If we take one example, we can see that drought has a community-level impact on water shortage, which in turn effects infectious diseases such as diarrhoea and cholera. Health 
emergency responses to this are suggested as (for example) food supplementation and 
health care, as well as epidemic surveillance and early warning systems.There are many areas for public health responses to drought Œ 5 are listed here - these can be seen as broadly strengthening the health system, and will be relevant regardless 
of the extent of climate change that we observe. These are win-win approaches and will 
strengthen our health system to respond to climate change as well as many other threats 
Œ Ebola is a good example of other nonclimate-related threats that will also benefit from 

stronger health systems.14Drought & health: Possible areas for 
public health responseSource: Atlas of Health 
& Climate, WMO/WHO (2012)fModule 2: Population health & climate change
61Hunger is a second important health impact of climate change, closely tied to drought.This map is the Global Hunger Index by severity.

The red, orange and apricot colours depict where hunger is the greatest. We can see here that the regions 
with the highest problems relating to hunger are in Africa, India and parts of north Asia and the Western 

Pacific.
We face a growing problem in the world Œ more people are facing food insecurity and hence undernutrition, 
while more and more are becoming obese or overweight.Rising temperatures and variable precipitation are likely to decrease the production of staple foods in many of the poorest regions, increasing risks of malnutrition (Parry et al., 2004).
According to IPCC, crop yields could decrease up to 30% in Central and South Asia by the mid-21st century. 
The rapid population growth and urbanization in the region will magnify the number of malnourished and the 
risk of hunger for most SEAR countries.In Bangladesh, production of rice and wheat might drop by 8% and 32%, respectively, by the year 2050 
(Faisal and Parveen, 2004).
Recent studies suggest a 2 to 5% decrease in yield potential of wheat and maize for a temperature rise of 0.5 to 1.5°C in India (Aggarwal, 2003). The net cereal production in South Asian countries is projected to decline at least between 4 to 10% by the end of this century under the most conservative climate change scenario. Some studies agree that higher temperatures and longer growing seasons could result in increased pest populations in temperate regions of Asia (Roy, 2006).
Given that 60% of the cropped area is still dependent on rainfall (MoEF, 2002), Indian agriculture continues to 
be fundamentally dependent on rainfall.151 billion people are undernourished2 billion are 
overweight or obeseGlobal Hunger Index (by severity): 2013Hunger

63Now, moving to our third example of health impacts Œ vector-borne diseases. Again, this 
is taken from the Human Health Chapter (11) of the latest IPCC assessment report (AR5). 
We can see here 
(CLICK) that malaria and dengue present the greatest burden of disease globally, with 220 millions cases/year for malaria, and 50 million cases/year for dengue. It 

is also shown here (CLICK) that both diseases are sensitive to changes in the climate which has been observed over the period 2008-2012.Here™s (CLICK) a reminder of what these symbols and confidence levels mean.
In terms of burden of disease, and priority setting, malaria and dengue are the current 
focus for many countries.Changes in climate are likely to lengthen the transmission season of important vector-
borne diseases like dengue and malaria and to alter their geographic range, potentially 
reaching regions that lack either population immunity and/or a strong public health 
infrastructure (Bhattacharya et al., 2006, Climate change and malaria in India; Hales et al., 
2002, Potential effect of population and climate changes on global distribution of dengue 

fever: an empirical model).Warmer temperatures and disturbed rain patterns could alter the distribution of important 
disease vectors. Combined with altered rainfall patterns, hotter conditions may increase 
the spread of disease, such as malaria, dengue, and chikungunya, to new areas.Next we will look at the example of dengue in more detail.17Vector-borne disease
Source: IPCC (2013)Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
64This image shows countries or areas at risk of dengue, 2011. What this shows is that much of the SE Asia and Western Pacific regions have reported dengue, so are already vulnerable 

to the disease, which is expected to worsen under climate change.Japan should also be added to this image, given the recent outbreak there in 2014. 
The red contour lines of the January and July isotherms indicate areas at risk, defined by the geographical limits of the northern and southern hemispheres for year-round survival

66Now we move on to looking at another health impact of climate change Œ heat-related mortality. The IPCC has indicated here (in the Asia chapter of the AR5) that there is a 

high confidence of an increase in heat-related mortality. Adaptation issues and prospects 

to respond to this include heat health-warning systems, urban planning to reduce heat 
islands, and the improvement of the built environment.20Heat-related mortalityModule 2: Population health & climate change
67This figure shows increasingly frequent heat extremes will combine with rapidly growing numbers of older people living in cities Œ who are particularly vulnerable to extreme heat. Countries are shaded here according to the expected proportional increase in urban populations aged over 65 by the year 2050. Bar graphs show how frequently the maximum daily temperature that would have occurred 
only once in 20 years in the late 20th century is expected to occur in the mid-21st century, with lower 

numbers indicating more frequent events. Results are shown for 3 different ﬁSRESﬂ scenarios (Blue = B1; Green = A1B, Red = A2), as described in the IPCC Special Report on Emissions 
Scenarios.Population growth is linked to climate change vulnerability. If nothing else changes, increasing numbers of 
people in locations that are already resource-poor and are affected by climate risks will magnify harmful 

impacts. Virtually all the projected growth in populations will occur in urban agglomerations, mostly in 

large, low latitude hot countries in which a high proportion of the workforce is deployed outdoors with little 
protection from heat. About 150 million people currently live in cities affected by chronic water shortages 
and by 2050, unless there are rapid improvements in urban environments, the number will rise to almost a 
billion (McDonald et al., 2011). Under a ﬁbusiness as usualﬂ scenario with mid-range population growth, the 

OECD projects that about 1.4 billion people will be without access to basic sanitation in 2050 (OECD, 2012). 

The age structure of the population also has implications for vulnerability (see Figure 11-2). The proportion 

aged over 60, world-wide, is projected to increase from about 10% presently to about 32% by the end of 
the century (Lutz 
et al., 2008). The prevalence of overweight and obesity, which is associated with relatively 

poor heat tolerance, has increased almost everywhere in the last 20 years, and in many countries the trend 
continues upwards (Finucane et al., 2011). It has been pointed out that the Sahel region of Africa may be 

particularly vulnerable to climate change because it already suffers so much stress from population pressure, 
chronic drought, and governmental instability (Diffenbaugh and Giorgi, 2012; Potts and Henderson, 2012).

70Let™s now look at another example of how climate change affects health Œ flooding. Again, 
the IPCC (in the Asia chapter) notes a key climate change risk as increased flooding leading 
to widespread damage to infrastructure and settlements in Asia. Adaptation measures suggested to respond to flood include extreme weather exposure reduction via better land-use planning, selective relocation of communities, reducing 

the vulnerability of essential services such as water, energy, waste management, food, 

telecommunications, and measures to assist vulnerable sectors and households.Source: IPCC AR5 Asia Report

73The next key risk from the IPCC™s AR5 that we take a quick look at is the increased risk of water-borne disease. Early warning systems, water management and sanitation 

programmes are suggested as useful adaptation responses.Source: IPCC AR5 Asia Report
27Water-borne disease
Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
74More variable precipitation patterns, together with warmer temperatures, are likely to compromise the supply of freshwater, increasing the risks of water-borne diseases like 

cholera and outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases (Rodó et al., 2002).Floods cause sewage and drinking water systems to mix. The lack of proper sanitation would make the problem worse. In 2012, the sanitation coverage in the South-East Asia Region was only of 45%, posing this as a major threat to water sources in terms of pollution with human faeces.Photo credit: © Shehzad Noorani/Still Pictures

Noorani, Still PicturessModule 2: Population health & climate change
75From water-borne disease, let™s move to water supply. One critical influence of water supply in Asia 
is glaciers. The Himalayas have the largest concentration of glaciers outside the polar region. These glaciers are a freshwater reserve; they provide the headwaters for nine major river systems in Asia Œ a lifeline for almost one-third of humanity.
There is clear evidence that Himalayan glaciers have been melting at an unprecedented rate in recent decades; this trend causes major changes in freshwater flow regimes and is likely to have 
a dramatic impact on drinking water supplies, biodiversity, hydropower, industry, agriculture, and 

others, with far-reaching implications for the people of the Region and the earth™s environment. 
Rapid glacier melting would result in a drastic reduction in the contribution to the river flow. Current 
permanent rivers would become seasonal. Melting glaciers together with disturbed rainfall patterns will increase the amount of water-induced 
hazards such as floods, flash floods, landslides, debris flows, and droughts. Rainfalls will increase in 
high latitudes and decrease in most subtropical land regions, many of which are already affected by

76Flooding is another impact of climate change that has impacts on human health.Twenty-one GLOF events have adversely affected Nepalese territory in the recent past.

The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), in partnership with UNEP and the Asia Pacific Network and in close collaboration with national partner 

organizations, documented baseline information on the Himalayan glaciers, glacial lakes, 
and GLOFs in a study that identified some 200 potentially dangerous glacial lakes in the 

Himalayas.Photo credit: Foto M. J. Hambrey, 2004, www.swisseduc.ch/glaciers/glossary/glof-2-de.html

77Lastly related to water, let™s look briefly at sea-level rise.
The warming of sea water leads to sea-level rise. Sea levels have risen faster in the last decade than in the previous 30 years. The total rise in sea level during the twentieth century is estimated to be 0.17 m. But a 
recent research report indicates that the rate of ocean warming from 1961 to 2003 is about 50% larger than 
previously reported (CSIRO, 2008). Global mean sea level is projected by IPCC to rise by between 18 and 59 

cm by the year 2100, but much larger increases cannot be ruled out.India has one of the most populated coastal communities in the world with approximately 500 people per mile of coastline, compared to the U.S., which has approximately 30 people per mile. India, for instance, has 

a 7500-km long densely populated and low-lying coastline inhabited by more than 10 million people (Shukla 

et al., 2003). UNEP identifies India among the 27 countries that are most vulnerable to sea level rise. Most of the coastal regions are agriculturally fertile, with paddy fields that are highly vulnerable to inundation and salinization. 
Coastal infrastructure, tourist activities, and onshore oil exploration are also at risk. The impacts of any 
increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as storm surges, could be disproportionately 
large, not just in heavily developed coastal areas, but also in terms of the paralyzing devastation in low-

income rural areas. The 1999 tropical cyclone that hit Orissa resulted in a death toll of about 10 000, and 
demonstrates the extreme significance of impacts related to climate variability. 
A district level ranking of vulnerability to one-metre sea level rise by constructing a weighted index. The study 
also assesses the economic implications of such a rise on the most and least vulnerable districts in order to 
provide the range of projected economic impacts on the Indian coast. In present value terms, the results range 
from 4.5 billion USD in the case of Mumbai, to 72 million USD in the case of Balasore. Image created by Robert A. Rohde / Global Warming Art, http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/Image:SE_

78In these last few slides I will briefly touch on some emerging themes that are starting to be understood a little better: migration and psychosocial stress.32MigrationPsychosocial stres
sModule 2: Population health & climate change
79The first is migration, and the potential for climate change to create ‚climate refugees™, due to a range of factors arising from climate change and its myriad flow on effects. We 

can see here that 5 direct impacts of climate change are listed Œ changes in food yields 
and fresh water availability, extreme weather events, changes to land availabiilty and 

general impacts on population health. These might then result in population pressures and 
social, demographic, political and economic stressors (which are mediated by adaptive 
responses), which can give rise to population movement and/or conflict. Finally, three 

types of population movement are indicated Œ forced displacement, planned resettlement 
or migration. Source: McMichael et al. 2012. An Ill Wind? Climate Change, Migration, and Health

80Coastal flooding, malnutrition, illnesses, migration, displaced people, and social conflicts 
are amongst the most significant effects from climate change that will affect human health. The loss of livelihood will increase psychosocial stress in the affected populations (McMichael et al., 2003a.

82To finish off Module 2, let™s look at action the health sector can take to manage the 
impacts of climate change on population health.36              
        
Action by the health sectorModule 2: Population health & climate change
83Urgent action is needed from the health sector, in collaboration with other sectors in order 
to respond to the risks to health posed by climate change.As we have learnt, global environmental changes are affecting climate, which in turn will impinge on, in profoundly adverse ways, some of the most fundamental pillars of life such 
as food, air, and water.
The main drivers behind these global changes are both natural and, increasingly so, human pressure. The disruption of environmental factors will have the most significant impacts on 
health. By adapting, we will reduce those adverse impacts. At the same time, we need to 

reduce our pressure on the environment through mitigation measures.Source: McMichael, Global environmental change and health: impacts, inequalities, and the health sector,

Climate change does not respect borders.2. Climate change will exacerbate current and underlying burden of disease. It won™t 
bring anything remarkably new or different, rather it will worsen our current health issues, such as undernutrition, diarrhoeal disease, and infectious diseases.3. People will feel the effects of climate change differently, depending on where they 
live. Some places will experience changes such as increasing intensity of cyclones, 
while others may experience longer-term changes, such as drought and drying.

101Just to remind ourselves of the need for urgent action - global environmental changes are affecting climate, which in turn will impinge on, in profoundly adverse ways, some of the 
most fundamental pillars of life: food, air and water.
The main drivers behind these global changes are both natural and, increasingly, human 
pressure. The disruption of environmental factors will have most significant impacts on 
health. By adapting we will reduce those adverse impacts. At the same time, we need to 
reduce our pressure on the environment, through mitigation measures.Source: McMichael, Global environmental change and health: impacts, inequalities, and the health sector,

104One clear mitigation option is the use of renewable energy.
This graphic shows that the world is making progress in relation to supporting the use of renewable energy. The figures are encouraging Œ globally there is 269 US$ billion 

invested in the clean energy sector, 118 countries have renewable energy targets, and solar 

technologies have received 145 billion US$ worth of investment.Shifting to renewable energy and away from polluting fossil fuels also has health benefits. Estimates of the co-benefits of reducing air pollution from coal-fired power plants and 

transport suggest that the immediate health benefits will be significant. These co-benefits 

need to be included in a comprehensive assessment of mitigation options.Source: Climate Commission. 2012. The Critical Decade.
14Renewable energySource: Climate Commission (2012)Module 3: Policies & practice of mitigation & adaptation: Relevance to health
105Reducing waste also helps mitigate climate change. The importance of reducing waste is shown in this image. There are two approaches to reducing waste Œ one is through regulation (via governments/global agreements, etc.), and the other is through individual behaviour change. Both are 
important.Source: United Nations Foundation. 2014. UN Climate Solutions Report in Numbers. http://www.

16Reduce food wasteModule 3: Policies & practice of mitigation & adaptation: Relevance to health
107A further option for mitigation is using and promoting active transport.Inactivity causes 9% (range 5·1Š12·5) of premature mortality, or more than 5·3 million of 
the 57 million deaths that occurred worldwide in 2008. If inactivity were not eliminated, 
but decreased instead by 10% or 25%, more than 533 000 and more than 1·3 million 
deaths, respectively, could be averted every year. 
Physical inactivity causes 6% (ranging from 3·2% in south-East Asia to 7·8% in the eastern Mediterranean region) of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease, 7% (3·9Š
9·6) of type 2 diabetes, 10% (5·6Š14·1) of breast cancer, and 10% (5·7Š13·8) of colon 

cancer. 
Mass marketing and availability of junk food and ‚supersized™ portions, (production of which also leads to GHG emissions) as well as sedentary lifestyles lead to obesity. 
Urban planning and transport policies at the local level can be part of the answer. Short 
trips made in cars covering distances of less than 3 km. can be covered in 15 Œ 20 minutes 
by bicycle or in 30 - 50 minutes by brisk walking. This corresponds to the recommended 

daily dose of at least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity physical activity.
This is a good example of the co-benefits or ‚win-win™ approach, where climate change 
mitigation can also result in improved health outcomes, and vice-versa.

19Co-bene˜ts of mitigationModule 3: Policies & practice of mitigation & adaptation: Relevance to health
111We™ll now finish off Module 3 by looking at mitigation and adaptation in terms of risk 
management.20Mitigation & 
adaptation as risk managementClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
112There are multiple frameworks for risk management; all have similar components. This framework was developed by the UK Climate Impacts Programme (www.ukcip.org) and 

illustrates the basic steps in managing climate risks. Risk management should consider both adaptation and mitigation, as both are needed to effectively manage the immediate and longer-term risks of climate change.
As the diagram shows, you should start with identifying the problem and objectives Œ step 1, then establish decision-making criteria, assess the risk, identify and appraise option, 
implement the decision and monitor. During steps 3, 4, and 5, it is important to iteratively 

assess the risk of options so as to ensure that the problem is defined correctly. If it isn™t, 

start again with the problem identification. Source: UK Climate Impacts Program (2006)
21Source: UK Climate Impacts Programme (2006)Risk management: UK Climate Impacts ProgrammeModule 3: Policies & practice of mitigation & adaptation: Relevance to health
113This diagram is from the latest IPCC report (AR5). In it, we can see that risk is at the centre of the framework, and arises from the combination of vulnerability, exposure and hazards. 

The pressures indicated on the left and the right of the diagram influence these factors. 
Climate (natural variability and anthropogenic climate change) is of course one of the 
key determinants of hazards, and influences exposure and vulnerability. Socioeconomic 

processes on the right include socioeconomic pathways (e.g. development trajectories), 

action taken on adaptation and mitigation, and governance (e.g. types of decision-making 

that is occurring to respond to climate change, such as regulation of GHG emissions 
through a carbon tax); these strongly influence vulnerability and hazard. Future risks that 

individuals and communities face arise from the interactions of exposure, vulnerability and 
hazards, and are influenced by climate and development. This in turn determines the level 
of impacts from changes in the climate. This diagram highlights that we need to look at the 
system as a whole to understand risks and impacts. Although we can assess (e.g.) mitigation 

actions and exposure to weather events separately, it is the combination of all of these 

components shown in the diagram that gives us a holistic picture of the overall risks. Source: IPCC AR5 report (2014)
22Risk managementSource: IPCC AR5 (2014)Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
114There are a wide range of possible interventions to avoid, prepare for, and respond to 
the health risks of climate change; some of these address both mitigation and adaptation. 
Interventions will be discussed in more detail in a later module. The first area of responses relate to reducing exposures. 
A second response area (CLICK to show prevention options) is preventing the onset of adverse outcomes through steps such as– (read)23Public health responses to the risks of climate changeReduce exposures

115Lastly, there are opportunities around response and treatment.
It is important to note that even with effective and timely implementation of interventions, there may be residual health impacts due to climate change. (CLICK to show).24Residual climate

116Adaptation includes the strategies, policies and measures undertaken now and in the future to reduce potential adverse health effects. A primary goal of building adaptive 
capacity is to reduce future vulnerability to climate variability and change. Adaptation 
actions will be taken at all levels, including our individual actions as well as programmes 
and activities implemented by national agencies and institutions. These actions can be 
proactive, anticipating adverse health outcomes, or in response to observed climate 
change. The severity of impacts actually observed will depend on the capacity to adapt 
and its effective deployment.Also important to understand the ‚adaptation baseline™ Œ i.e.:
What is being done now to reduce the burden of disease? How effective are these policies and measures?What could be done now to reduce current vulnerability? What are the main barriers to implementation (such as technology or political will)?What measures should begin to be implemented to increase the range of possible future interventions?Answering these questions will provide a picture of current programmes and activities to reduce the burden of climate sensitive-health outcomes, as well as what could be done to 

reduce the current and projected future risks of climate variability.

of climate change e˜ects)Reactive (taken in response to experienced climate change e˜ects)The severity of impacts will depend on the capacity to adapt &its e˜ective deploymentModule 3: Policies & practice of mitigation & adaptation: Relevance to health
117These questions need to be addressed when designing adaptation policies and measures. Adaptation to what Œ is adaptation required to flooding, the spread of vector-borne

weather/climate hazard and the health outcome of concern. CLICK: The effectiveness of interventions needs to be determined before improving current programmes or implementing new ones. Are there additional interventions that could reduce the current burdens of climate-sensitive health outcomes? Would a heat 

event early warning system be useful? Additional surveillance? Etc.CLICK: Using projections of changes in climate and socioeconomic conditions, what are the likely impacts? Which population groups are likely to be at the highest risk? For 
example, aging of populations in developed countries is likely to increase population 
vulnerability to heat events.26Questions for designing adaptation policies & measuresAdaptation to what?

118Who will undertake the adaptations is another question that should be asked when designing adaptation policies and measures Œ individuals, communities, nations? Will the 

adaptation be reactive to climate change or proactive? How can the process be facilitated?CLICK: When should the interventions be implemented? For example, there is concern 
about malaria spreading to highland areas of Africa. Surveillance systems should be established at the edges of the current distribution where changes in temperature and/
or precipitation could provide a suitable climate for malaria vectors. Once surveillance 
has identified the presence of the vectors, then programmes to distribute treated bednets 
could be implemented.CLICK: The effectiveness of all interventions should be monitored and evaluated to ensure that public health funds are being used effectively and efficiently.

Finally, win-win or no-regrets strategies should be considered as a priority.

119Here are some examples of adaptation measures to reduce the geographic spread and increased incidence of vectorborne diseases that are projected to occur in some areas. 
There are multiple categorization schemes for adaptation measures; this categorizes 
measures into those that are primarily decision support tools, those where technology 
development is needed, those requiring modification or implementation of surveillance 
and monitoring programmes, and those where infrastructure development would increase 
resilience to vector-borne diseases.

128Instructions for delivery of Module 4This is a long and technical module, requiring a high level of concentration from participants. While some participants may have a background in health assessment and epidemiology, for 

many the content is likely to be highly detailed. Section 1 is particularly long.
Given that no exercises are contained in Module 4, ensure that you check regularly for understanding of the material and that you ask participants if they have any questions. 
Acknowledge at a number of points as you go that while the material is detailed, it has 
significance for participants in showing them the detail behind how the impacts of climate 
change can be assessed and predicted, and therefore prepared for.
It™s likely to also be worthwhile to have a stretch break during the module delivery, 
asking people to get up and stretch before sitting down again, or walk to the back of 
the room. You could also create a spontaneous learning reflection such as ﬁOk, a quick 

challenge. Turn to the person next to you and tell them how concept X could be applied in 

your workplace.ﬂKey terms introduced in Module 4

health e˜ectsClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
136The distinction between studies of weather-related effects and those relating to climate 
change are illustrated here.Climate change evolves over decades, and has the potential to bring about a variety of change in the environment and the response of human and other populations.Climate is measured in a few decades, and seasonality in months or a few years.
Most epidemiological studies concentrate on changes occurring over a few days to weeks and rely on observation of past events.To understand the impact of future climate change necessarily entails some form of 
modelling, usually combining evidence on short-term weather-health relationships derived 

from epidemiological studies of past events with models of future climates derived from 
global circulation models.A great many assumptions are made in such modelling, including the probably unrealistic 
assumption that the health effects of climate change can be adequately represented by 
today™s short-term weather-health relationships extrapolated to future climatic patterns.

Œ relationships may be divided into observational studies of past weather patterns, and 
modelling studies that try to predict changes by combining epidemiological data with 
climate predictions.The simplest type of observational study is the study of individual, extreme, meteorological events: deaths and injuries during severe wind storms, floods, heat waves, droughts.Time-series studies use data for longer periods, and attempt to define more general 
relationships between, for example, temperature and mortality, but observation of daily or 

weekly data over several years.Some analyses focus on the length of the season within each year that health events occur, 
for example the timing and duration of periods of aero-allergens (pollens), the seasonal 

patterns of diarrhoeal illness or vector-borne diseases.
Changes in the geographical distribution of disease are often of interest in relation to vector-borne disease, such as malaria and dengue, but require extensive data about 

disease occurrence over time and space.7Types of analysisOBSERVATIONAL1.Episodes or event analysis: heat wave, ˜ood, drought, cyclone, El Niño–2.Time-series analysis: mortality/morbidity vs. temperature/precipitation3.Seasonality: diarrhoea, aero-allergens, vector-borne diseases4.Changes in geographical distribution: temperature/precipitation vs.vector borne diseases (VBDs)Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
138Model-based studies include ones that try to predict future burdens by assuming current weather-health patterns applied to future worlds with altered climate, and decision-

analysis studies that look at the potential risks and benefits of particular health protection 
measures.8Types of analysisMODEL-BASED1.Health burdens: risk assessments2.Decision analysis of health impact of policy optionsModule 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change139Let us now turn our attention to the epidemiological study of short-term weather-health 
events. There are two main approaches, which are closely-related to each other.
Episode analyses focus on single events that can be defined in terms of date: a period of a heat wave, date of a flood, etc. The principles of analysis are very simple: to examine the 
change in the occurrence of health events (deaths, hospital admissions, cases of infectious 
disease etc.) during or after the event compared with some appropriate pre-event baseline.
The second approach is really an extension of the episode analysis, in which data are assembled for a much longer time-period and analysed to determine the general 

relationship between meteorological parameters and health adjusting for time-varying 

confounders. It is a more complex form of analysis, which can incorporate elements of the 
episode analysis.9Short-term changes: two

mean birth weight of babies born in a town in Southern Highland Province, Papua New 

Guinea. There is a prominent drop in the birth weight between 1982 and 1983. These 
years coincide with the years of most powerful El Niño episode in 20th Century. Prolonged 

drought in the highland may provoked poor nutrition of less privileged group of population 
group, women and children, in this traditional town. Time interval of a long-term event 

such as drought is longer, over months to years. In general, episodic analysis is based on 

much shorter time interval, usually days.Source: Modified from Allen BJ. Birthweight and environment at Tari. PNG Med J 2002;45(1-2):88-98

Module 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change141Another variant is studies which focus not on the determinants of daily count of death or illness, but on the seasonal distribution Œ a widening perhaps in the period of the year with 
raised frequency of occurrence.Such questions have been of interest for aero-allergens (pollen seasons) and the spread of 
some forms of diarrhoeal disease, which tend to occur in conditions of higher temperature 
favouring the replication of the pathogenic organism outside the host.11Cases of

142The incidence of cholera shows a bimodal seasonal distribution in Dhaka, Bangladesh: the first peak (AprilŒMay) occurs before the monsoon, and the second (SeptemberŒOctober) 
occurs at the end of the monsoon, suggesting that weather factors could play a role in 
a different way. Later, late-monsoon peak may present a typical water- and food-borne 

outbreak related with a contamination of coastal sea water. Earlier, pre-monsoon peak, 

however, may present a active person-to-person transmission related with a shortage of 

water for hygiene as consequence of prolonged dry period.Source: Hashizume M, Faruque AS, Wagatsuma Y, Hayashi T, Armstrong B. Cholera in Bangladesh: climatic

epidemics in the South Pacific in relation to the Southern Oscillation Index, which defines 

El Niño and La Niña years.This type of study aims to identify correlations with broad scale meteorological conditions as reflect by markers such as the SOI. Such studies tend to control for few other time-

144Consider the stylized graph above, which represents diagrammatically the pattern of health endpoints that occur across a year. This might be a year in the temperate northern hemisphere that runs from 

January (far left) to December (far right).The jagged blue line represents the daily number of deaths. Note that there is short-term (day-to-day) 
variation in deaths, which in part reflects random variation, but also the effect of risk factors that vary 
over the short-term, such as outdoor temperature. There is also a smooth underlying variation in the 
average number of deaths (highest far left and far right) which is meant to represent seasonal fluctuation. 
Finally there are two obvious peaks of death, one in the centre which indicates a heat wave effect (the 

timing of which is indicated by the green trace), and one near the left which represents the effect of a 
small influenza epidemic, whose timing is indicated by the red bar.
The number of deaths attributable to the heat wave can be thought of as the area under the peak in mid year which coincides with the period of high temperatures. That is, it is the area under within the peak 
but above the expected (= average) number of daily deaths for the time of year. 
This average may be represented by the dotted blue line, which is a moving average of deaths across the year. However, the first dotted blue line is dragged up a bit by the effect of the influenza outbreak, so a 

better baseline is represented by the second dotted blue line in which the effect of the influenza period 
has been taken into account.The deaths attributable to the heat wave may therefore be thought of as the area of the approximately triangular shaped area shown in light blue, whose base is the second dotted blue line. This, essentially, 

is the basis of all methods that try to calculate attributable health events (deaths, hospital cases, etc.) in 
episode analysis.

     December14Module 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change145This graph shows the actual pattern of daily deaths in Seoul, South Korea, during the heat wave of 
1994.As in the stylized example shown in the previous slide, it shows the daily variation in deaths, the seasonal fluctuation and the very obvious sharp peak in deaths occurring at the height of outdoor 
temperatures shown by the lower trace.In this graph, the dates of the beginning and end of the 2004 heat wave have been added as vertical dashed lines, and the moving average of deaths to the left and right of that period have been 
calculated and are shown as the continuous red line.The attributable deaths during the period of the heat wave are thus represented by the grey shading.

Note: 1. The definition of the beginning and end of the heat wave are somewhat arbitrary, as 
they may be defined in a variety of ways Œ e.g. in terms of absolute temperature, or by 
exceedance of a percentile (say the 98th) of the usual temperature distribution, or in terms 
of a continuous run of hot days, etc. Different definitions could give slightly different dates 
for the beginning and end of the heat wave. Observe that occasional days before and after 
the heat wave as defined here were actually hotter than those of the heat wave itself.
2. As stated, this method counts deaths only during the period of heat, whereas some may be 
delayed (lagged) by a day or two.Source: Cheong, HK. 2015. (These figures were drawn by Cheong based on the climate data from Korea

146In this graph, the daily deaths for 1994 and two earlier years are presented as a function of temperature rather than date. The red line shows a smoothed function to indicate the 
underlying pattern of the temperature-mortality relationship which includes: 
 a temperature region (around 15 to 20 Celsius) where daily mortality is lowest: 
the ‚minimum mortality™ temperature band
 a gradual rise in mortality with colder temperatures (to the left of the minimum 
mortality temperature range) a steeper rise in mortality at hotter temperatures (to the right of the minimum 
mortality temperature range).This type of plot is more informative in indicating the overall nature of the temperature-

mortality relationship, rather than just the change in deaths during a particular period of 
heat as shown in the previous slide.Source: Cheong, HK. 2015. (These figures were drawn by Cheong based on the climate data from Korea

expected of a similar heat wave in future.However, it has several disadvantages: the difficulties in defining what a heat wave period 
is, and the fact that it uses only part of the data and does not provide further evidence 
about the broader relationship between temperature and mortality (or other health 
endpoint) as alluded to in the previous slide.A more detailed form of analysis is represented by time-series studies.

148Time-series studies of health endpoints in relation to meteorological parameters typically 
use data from across several years and they analyse the short-term associations at the daily 
or weekly level.Thus, they are usually a form of regression analysis in which the outcome is the daily count of deaths (or other health endpoint), and the explanatory factors daily weather variables. 
They are suitable for analysing the general relationship between e.g. temperature and 

mortality, which can include quantification of the effect of specific episodes of heat, etc.
Results for studies of temperature-mortality relationships usually show U- of V-shaped 
curves (as described earlier), with ‚thresholds™ for cold and heat effects. Such analysis are 
normally adjusted for time-varying confounding factors, and they can take account of 

time-lags.

episodes or e˜ects of local ˚uctuations in meteorological parametersU-or V-shape of temperature-response 
functionDi˜erent lags
Module 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change149One of the additional features is the need for and the ability to allow for time lags.Thus can be done in the regression analysis simply by including terms to represent the values of the meteorological variables for yesterday, the day before that, the day before 

the day before yesterday and so on. For example, we might write, T[t-i] to indicate the 

temperature on day t-i (i.e. a lag of i days).Empirically it is found that heat effects are generally quite prompt, so if it is hot today, 
people die to day or tomorrow, or perhaps the day after. But evidence of an effect of heat 

lagged by more than a few days is very rare.Cold effects, in contrast, can be delayed by up to several weeks, so that cold today may continue to have an effect on mortality in two or three weeks time.For cold effects in particular, the time lag appears somewhat different for different causes 
of death. Cardiovascular deaths occur comparatively promptly, peaking within a few days, 

while respiratory deaths continue to rise for around two weeks.In any time-series regression analysis, is it good practice to include terms to capture all 
time lags that may be relevant for a particular exposure and cause of death.19LagsHeat impacts short: 0-2 daysCold impacts long: 0-21 days
Vary by cause-of-death-CVD: prompt-respiratory death: slowShould include terms for all relevant lags
Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
150In summary, time-series studies provide evidence about the general relationships between 
weather parameters and health outcomes, based on short-term effects.The fact that they effectively compare the population with itself day by day provides considerable advantage in interpreting the effect of weather-heath relationships.
Such studies have found evidence of heat and cold effects in nearly all populations studies to date.There are, however, some uncertainties about the public health significance of this evidence 
because it relates only to short-term effects (=exacerbation and acute effects predominantly on 
the frail?), and because of the possibility of the harvesting phenomenon.As later slides indicate, there are also considerable uncertainties in extrapolating the evidence of time-series studies to the future, as their evidence is not directly about climate change or 

even climate.20Summary of time-series

Module 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change151A second category of studies relevant to questions of climate change and health are ones relating to the geographical distribution of disease Œ for example, changes in malaria.Often, the questions are about predicting future patterns of spread, and thus entail disease modelling. In very broad terms, two different approaches are used for quantifying the risk 

associated with particular climatic conditions.The first uses data, obtained from laboratory studies, to quantify the biological behaviour of the mosquito vector and the parasite under different temperature and/or other 
meteorological conditions. From such data, it is possible to identify the type of conditions 

that favour transmission of disease and to place some quantification on this. These are 
often described as biological models, for obvious reasons.A second approach uses observed data on disease and disease vectors from field stations around the world and relates them to local climatic conditions. Using data from multiple 
sites, it is possible to construct regression equations to explain the probability of disease 
occurrence as a function of temperature and other climatic conditions. This is often 
referred to as the statistical approach.21Changes in geographical distribution of disease

152Geographic distribution of a specific disease usually represents the distribution of factors that is related with the vector ecology. Health map of scrub typhus in Korea shows a good 

correlation of disease report with the distribution of temperature, which reflect a condition 
for the proliferation of vector mites.Source: Figure on the left : Distribution of scrub typhus cases by county, 2007. Korea Centers for

Similarly, the incubation period of the parasite can be 

quantified.Combining all three functions allows the calculation of a ‚transmission potential™ on the bottom right, which provides a quantified measure of the relative potential for transmitting 
malaria under specific temperature conditions.On its own, this sort of approach can provide evidence about the possible change in disease transmission if temperatures increase under climate change, but the actual effect 
on the geographical distribution of disease depends on many factors other than the 
climate/weather. Biological models alone therefore provide only a partial answer, and must 

be interpreted in the light of other evidence about the determinants of disease, such as the 
effect of socio-economic development.

154Statistical models are likewise limited if based only on evidence about climatic associations, without taking into account data on other modifying factors and the complex 
biology of the vector and disease.Thus, maps such as this one, which use statistical evidence combined with climate scenarios to derive estimates of the possible change in the distribution of disease, must be 
interpreted as a guide only. The real picture is likely to be much more complicated and 

influenced by a multitude of factors. This is an area where ongoing research should help to provide improved, multi-factorial models based on a combination of biological understanding and statistical evidence.Source: Hales et al.

Module 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change155In conclusion, a variety of methods may be used to try to understand the influence of the climate/weather on health. Most such studies focus on weather-health relationships, and 

have only partial bearing on the effect of climate change for several reasons, including:  The fact that climate change may give rise to many forms of change additional to the effects quantified in studies of short-term weather-health relationship.
 The fact that many changes will occur over time in factors other than the climate itself, 
and these changes are likely to have important influence on the vulnerability to weather 
effects and hence on the burden of climate change-attributable disease.
Models of climate change impacts on health are intrinsic to the assessment of adaptation and mitigation options, but they entail many uncertainties and their evidence should be 
treated with caution.Recommended further reading: 2007 IPCC report: The Physical Science Basis, pages 37 to 43 ( T.S 3.1.2 and T.S 3.1.3; FAQ 6.2 page 114

156We™ve looked at different analysis types in the first section of this module. Next we™ll cover 
how the health impacts of climate change are modelled.26Modelling the 
health impacts of climate changeModelledtemperaturechange202020802050Module 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change157Projecting the health impacts of climate change presents challenges different from considering the future impacts of other risk factors. The ﬁexposureﬂ (in terms of changing 
temperature and precipitation patterns) will change over time, with high uncertainty about 
the rate and extent of impacts in a particular region. In addition, there will be significant 
changes in the demographic structure of most populations, technologies in 2100 will differ 
from those of today, and socioeconomic development may change the world as much as 

from 1900 to today. Standard epidemiologic analyses are not designed to deal with these 

complexities.272015190021002000141617181319Year205019501860Modelled

158The potential future health impacts of climate change can be estimated using: Expert judgment that considers current health burdens, the driving forces for those burdens, and trends that are likely to affect the health burdens over time. For example, 

the warming associated with climate change will provide opportunities for more rapid 
replication of many water- and foodborne pathogens. Rural areas in mountainous areas 

without sustainable access to improved sanitation can be expected to experience an 
increase in diarrheal diseases if no additional interventions are implemented.Current trends can be extrapolated to future periods, assuming no major changes in those trends due to climate change or socioeconomic development. For example, continued 

increases in temperature could result in the mosquitoes that carry dengue fever, malaria, 

and other vector-borne diseases to continue to expand their geographic range in 

mountainous areas.Models, based on biological properties of disease transmission dynamics or on statistical associations between environmental variables and health outcomes, are being increasingly 
used to gain insights into how climate change could affect future patterns of climate-

sensitive health outcomes. Models range from simple  

(i.e. considering only one key variable that will change with climate change, such as 
temperature extremes), to fully integrated models that incorporate all known processes of 
significance.28Estimating future health impacts of climate changeExpert judgmentSimple extrapolatio
nMathematical/statistical modelingŒBivariateŒMultivariateŒFully integratedModule 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change159Models are simplified representations of complex, dynamic relationships. Models aim to identify key processes for the association between climate change and health, to further 
insights into how changing weather patterns could affect the geographic range, seasonal 
length, and incidence of health outcomes. The goal of a ﬁgoodﬂ model is to provide 

insights into possible future changes in health outcomes with enough confidence for 
decision-makers to plan for possible interventions to avoid, prepare for, and effectively 

respond to the health risks of climate change. For example, several models suggest that a 

changing climate will provide an opportunity for various vector species to increase their 
geographic range in mountainous areas in the coming decades. Public health institutions 

and agencies can use that information to plan for where and when to alter current 
surveillance programmes.29Mathematical/statistical models

160As noted in the slide, models provide consistent frameworks for exploring interactions and feedbacks, but do not predict what will happen because of limited knowledge of all factors 
that affect an outcome, including how those factors will change over temporal and spatial 
scales.The general circulation models that are used to project climate change rely on scenarios of how many people there will be in the world, how wealthy they will be, and what kinds of 
technology they will use.30ModelsModels are usefulŒParticularly if the relationship is strong or involves a clear threshold above which an outcome event is very likelyŒConsistent framework for structuring scienti˜c knowledgeŒExplore interactions & feedbacksModels do not predictŒLimited knowledge of all factors driving an outcomeŒPolicy-makers must understand that models estimate changes in probabilityŒModels are di˚cult to validateModule 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change161Whether based on studies of a temporal or geographical nature, there is often interest in attempting to calculate future burdens of disease under climate change scenarios. There 
are various reasons for doing this, including: 1. To demonstrate the potential nature and size of health burdens that may arise 
under climate change as a background to policy development2. To provide evidence on the measures needed to protect human health
3. To provide comparative evidence about the possible effect (on health) of 
alternative adaptation and/or mitigation policies.Indeed, the World Health Organization has undertaken an assessment of current climate 
change burdens through the Comparative Risk Assessment initiative, and this may shortly 
be extended to consider future climate change impacts.31Future burdens: risk assessmentTo demonstrate the potential nature 
& size of health burdens that may arise

the possible e˜ect (on health) of alternative

policiesClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
162The basis of the future burdens approach is very simple in principle: 1. obtain scenario-based evidence about the future distribution of climate patterns 
under assumptions of greenhouse gas emissions; 2. define relevant climate sensitive health endpoints that may be affected by such 
change;3. derive evidence on the strength of relevant exposure-response functions (e.g. 
temperature-mortality); and 
4. compute burdens of disease in terms of years of life lost (YLL), disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) and premature mortality, by combination of (i) to (iii).

The plot of relative risk of mortality vs. temperature is based on quantitative evidence of the exposure-response function for 

heat in the Delhi population. The attributable burden of heat death can be calculated 
by multiplying the excess risk at each temperature by the frequency with which each 
temperature occurs. If the current temperature distribution is shifted to the right under 
climate change, the change in heat-attributable burden can be obtained by comparing the 
burden calculations obtained from the new temperature distribution (dashed line) with 
those obtained from the current temperature distribution (solid line).This, in essence, is the process used to compare any burdens of diseases under different scenarios of climate change.33Relative mortality (% of daily average)Daily mean temperature/degrees CelsiusTemperature distribution01020304080100120140Heat-related mortality (Delhi)hi)tlit(Delhhi(Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
164Scenarios have been developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) of pathways to future worlds. The definition of a scenario is provided, as well as the 
components of a scenario. IPCC scenarios will be discussed on subsequent slides.34Scenarios
Coherent, internally consistent depictions of
 pathways to possible futures based on assumptions about economic, ecological, social, political & technological development.Scenarios include: ŒQualitative storylines that describe assumptions about the initial state & the driving forces, events 
& actions that lead to future conditions
ŒModels that quantify the storylineŒOutputs that explore possible future outcomes if assumptions are

ŒConsideration of uncertainties
Module 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change165Scenarios have been used for the three goals listed. Much of the analysis with scenarios has focused on the first bullet Œ understanding the possible consequences of mitigation 
policies. There has been increasing use of scenarios to project the health impacts of 
climate change, as summarized in the Human Health chapter of the IPCC 5th Assessment 
Report. There has been limited use of scenarios to explore adaptation options, although 
there is increasing interest in doing so.35Goals of scenarios

166IPCC adopted a new greenhouse gas concentration trajectories called RCP from its AR5 in 2013, which is based on the radiative forcing and replacing previous scenario, SRES 
(Special Report on Emissions Scenarios). Four representative pathways; RCP2.6, RCP4.5, 

RCP6.0, and RCP8.5; are named after a possible range of radiative forcing in the year 
2100 relative to pre-industrial values.
RCP8.5: One high pathway for which radiative forcing reaches >8.5 W mŒ2 by 2100 and continues to rise for some amount of time (the corresponding ECP assuming constant 
emissions after 2100 and constant concentrations after 2250);RCP6.0 and RCP4.5: Two intermediate stabilization pathways in which radiative forcing is 
stabilized at approximately 6 W mŒ2 and 4.5 W mŒ2 after 2100 (the corresponding ECPs assuming constant concentrations after 2150);RCP2.6: One pathway where radiative forcing peaks at approximately 3 W mŒ2 before 2100 and then declines (the corresponding ECP assuming constant emissions after 2100).Source: IPCC 5th Assessment Report, 2013

uncertainty, or (c) can decrease with additional model improvements and observational

be in that range, with a probability of 90%Source: IPCC AR5, Working Group I p. 141

170As you can imagine, there is a wide range of uncertainties associated with these scenarios, from whether the full range of possible futures was captured, to uncertainties 
about assumed rate and extent of change in demographics, economic growth, etc., to 
uncertainties about the consequences of current and future policy choices.40Sources of uncertainty

ŒŒŒModule 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change171It is important to keep in mind various cautions about the sort of calculations shown in the previous slide. There are many reasons why the calculations may not give an accurate picture of the actual 
future burdens. Among the key factors are the following: 1. Extrapolation. Almost by definition, these calculations often have to extrapolate exposure-
response functions beyond the range of current exposures (temperatures, rainfall patterns 
etc.), and it is difficult to know how risks may look under those extreme conditions.2. There is often very great variation in the shape of exposure-response functions in different 
populations which may arise for many reasons. Without better understanding of the reasons 

for those variations, it is difficult to be confident how patterns may look in future under 
climate change.3. Adaptation. Populations will, of course, learn to adapt to climate change which may well 
reduce the impacts that might otherwise be expected from current observation.4. Effect modification. A whole variety of factors have the potential to influence vulnerability 
to climate sensitive diseases. These include very broad factors such as levels of socio-

economic development, and more specific factors such as housing quality. As yet, we have 

little quantification of the degree to which such factors modify the risks of climate-sensitive 

diseases, and thus how important they may be in determining future burdens.For these and other reasons, estimates of future burdens should be treated as broadly indicative 

only. Remember also that current epidemiological studies mainly focus on short-term influences and 

extrapolations based on them are unlikely to capture all forms of health effect relevant to climate 
change.41UncertaintiesEXTRAPOLATION

172To finish off Module 5, I™d like to briefly cover some of the changing sources of 
vulnerability to climate change, and how these affect analysis and modelling.
42Changing vulnerability to 

climate change4Module 4: Assessment & prediction of the health impacts of climate change173Vulnerability to climate change is the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. 
Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts including sensitivity or susceptibility to 

harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. (IPCC. 2013. AR5).The factors that influence vulnerability to climate change are multiple, and it is worth remembering that over the long term there may be dramatic changes in some of these 
factors, just as there may be in the climate itself.
The population may change (typically growing older, and often changing the prevalence 
of climate-sensitive disease as the epidemiological patterns change Œ often towards more 

chronic disease).There may also be deliberate environmental changes, such as flood protection.
Then there are the various categories of adaptation, which may include: physiological habituation (acclimatization Œ ‚getting used to™ the new climatic conditions), behavioural 

changes (learning to behave in ways that reduce risks of adverse effects), structural 
adaptation (infrastructure and other changes to meet new conditions, e.g. wider use of air 

conditioning in homes), and public health interventions, including ones specifically aimed 
at protecting vulnerable members of the community through warning systems and direct 
support/protection.These various forms of adaptation may considerably modify the scale of impact for particular climatic changes by comparisons with what might be expected on the basis of 
simple extrapolation from current epidemiological evidence.43Changing vulnerabilityhanges in population-Demographic structure (age)-Prevalence of weather-sensitive diseasenvironmental modi˜ers

174Three examples of the use of scenarios are provided in this and the following slides.Woodruff et al. used scenarios in their modeling of projected heat-related deaths in older 
adults due to higher mean annual temperatures under low and higher greenhouse gas 
emission scenarios. From a baseline of 1100 annual deaths related to heat, and considering 

only the independent effect of temperature, very hot days in 2100 were projected to 
increase the number of deaths by 600 under a scenario of lower greenhouse gas emissions 
and by 2100 under a scenario of higher emissions. These projections held demographic 
change constant. The second bar shows the independent effect of an ageing population on projected numbers of deaths (i.e. temperature was held constant). The increased number of deaths 
projected for the higher emission scenario is due to a larger population.The third bar shows the combined (additive) effect of temperature and aging.

The fourth bar speculates that if there are synergistic interactions between higher temperatures and aging, that the number of deaths in 2100 may be higher than the 

additive effects of temperature and aging.

Thermal extremes, including extremely cold and heat, are by definition relatively rare. 
What is extreme in one location is not necessarily extreme elsewhere, hence the need for 
local definitions of what constitutes an extreme event.CLICK to show ‚Excess health outcomes™. Excess health outcomes also is a critical concept. Death certificates and visits to health care providers rarely include temperature extremes as an underlying cause, so it is difficult to determine the exact number of adverse health 
events. Instead, the number of excess health outcomes determines the impact of an event; 
this is the difference in the number or rate of outcomes during the event, compared with 
what would have been expected if the event had not occurred. Not all observed health 
outcomes during an event should be attributed to the weather conditions.Differences from that baseline during and shortly after the extreme thermal event provide a means to measure the event™s severity and an opportunity to evaluate who was most 
vulnerable to the event. Key conceptsEvents vs. seasons
Thermal extremes focus on relatively short-lived weather conditions (generally days) that are in the ‚tails™in  distributions summarizing annual or seasonal weather Excess health outcomes De˜ned as the di˚erence in the number/rate of outcomes during thermal extremes compared with what would be expected if the event had not occurred.  This is assumed to re˛ect the health impact of the extreme temperatures.

190This schematic shows how climate change could increase not only mean temperatures, but also more record hot weather and less record cold weather. This figure assumes the 

variance remains the same, the only change is a shift in mean temperatures. However, observations indicate that both the mean and variance of temperature are 
changing. This means the curve is being flattened and extended further to the right, 

resulting in even more hot and record hot weather. At the same time, the risk of very cold 

weather remains.Source: IPCC 2007. Technical Summary. In: Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of

As 
shown on the slide, a heatwave occurred in India in 2003 that resulted in more than 1900 
excess deaths.Higher temperatures increase the occurrence of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke, and exacerbate existing conditions related to circulatory, 

respiratory, and nervous-system problems. An increase in heatwaves, particularly in urban 

areas, could significantly increase deaths. Higher overnight temperatures during heatwaves 
are a concern for human health, as cooler temperatures at night offer much-needed relief 
from the heat of the day.

Module 5: Thermal extremes195Here™s another example, this time from China. These figures show the mean daily excess mortality associated with daily maximum temperature in four Chinese cities: Harbin, Nanjing, Shenzhen, and Chonguing. The 

increase in mortality with increasing temperature is evident, as is the variability across 
regions in the temperature thresholds at which mortality begins to increase significantly. 
The temperature thresholds for all-cause mortality were 29°C, 35°C, 33°C and 34°C for 
Harbin, Nanjing, Shenzhen and Chongqing, respectively. After adjusting for potential 

confounders including air pollution, strong associations between daily maximum 
temperature and daily mortality from all-cause, cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic 

outcomes, and particularly diabetes, were observed in different geographical cities, 
with increases of 3.2-5.5%, 4.6-7.5% and 12.5-31.9% (with 14.7-29.2% in diabetes), 
respectively, with each 1°C increment in the daily maximum temperature over the 

threshold. A stronger temperature-associated mortality was detected in females compared 

to males. Additionally, both the population over 55 years and younger adults aged 30 to 

54 years reported significant heat-mortality associations.Source: Li et al. Association between high temperature and mortality in metropolitan areas of four cities in

196India and Bangladesh are among the countries most vulnerable to extreme thermal conditions. Using population estimates that are consistent with the time period covered by these tables (India 1050 million and Bangladesh 144 million), these results suggest roughly 273 
heat-related deaths per year for India and 43 for Bangladesh. Critical features of these events include that they do not follow a predictable temporal distribution and that impacts can vary widely by event. While across India there is 
relatively consistent reporting of extreme heat events each year, the number deaths and 

location of the events vary widely.

Source:  EM-DAT (2008)tremeermaalexttraes:essofthheModule 5: Thermal extremes197These graphs illustrate several issues with studying the impacts of thermal extremes:Hot and cold extreme temperatures increase mortality even in a warm city such as Chiang Mai.The study found non-linear effects of temperature on all mortality types and age groups, with excess deaths starting to occur on the same or subsequent day of an extreme even. 
Generally, the hot effects on various cause of mortality and age groups were short-term, 

while the cold effects lasted longer. There often was a decrease in mortality several days 

after an event, so-called mortality displacement, that reflects that some of the deaths 

during the event were in individuals who would have died within a short time period 
anyway. This displacement needs to be taken into consideration when estimating total 

excess mortality from an event; the reduction in deaths needs to be included in any 
analysis.The relative risk of mortality associated with cold temperatures (19.35°C, 1st %ile of temperature) relative to 24.7°C (25th %ile of temperature) was 1.29 (95% confidence 
interval (CI): 1.16, 1.44) for lags 0Œ21. The relative risk of mortality associated with high 
temperature (31.7°C, 99th %ile of temperature) relative to 28°C (75th %ile of temperature) 
was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.24) for lags 0Œ21.Source: Guo et al. Effects of temperature on mortality in Chiang Mai city, Thailand: a time series study.

198Let™s now look at how you identify thermal extremes14How to identify 
thermal extremesModule 5: Thermal extremes199There are several approaches for identifying extreme thermal events, as listed on the slide.The results of using different approaches as well as their relative advantages and drawbacks are presented in the following slides. 15Identifying extreme thermal conditionsEvaluating meteorological 
data against established criteria (e.g. threshold 
temperatures, comfort indices, historical 

distributions)
Analyzing observed health impacts
Combining meteorological & health impact 
assessment 
Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
200There are two broad categories of approaches to identifying thermal extremes using observed/forecast meteorological conditions: Fixed threshold criteria and relative threshold 

criteria.Fixed threshold criteria use non-varying values for temperature, or combined measures 
such as humidex or apparent temperature, to define when conditions would be defined 
as extreme heat or extreme cold. The humidex, heat index, apparent temperature, and 
other combined variable measures combine temperature, humidity, and other variables to 

provide a measure of how the temperature feels and/or to quantify the associated physical 
discomfort and health risk for hot weather. Estimates of the temperature adjusted for wind 

chill provide a similar example of an index used for extremely cold temperatures. 16Meteorological options to identify 
extreme thermal conditionsFixed threshold criteriaExtreme thermal conditions exist when criteria are exceeded at any point in time, for example:Extreme heat if temperature is > 40ºCExtreme cold if temperature is < -10 ºCTemperatures exceed a seasonal distribution value (e.g. 5th or 95th percentile)
A temperature threshold is associated with increased 
adverse health outcomes
Module 5: Thermal extremes201Relative criteria use threshold measures that vary by location and time of season to identify extreme thermal conditions. In areas with minimal thermal variation, where there is also 
generally low health risk and minimal health impacts from extreme thermal events, there 
might be no effective difference in a fixed or relative threshold. In areas where ﬁnormalﬂ 
conditions vary over the course of a season, the use of relative thresholds can result in 
criteria that also vary considerably within a season. 17Meteorological options to identify

202This hypothetical example shows how the use of fixed and relative thresholds would result in different periods within a summer meeting the criteria for ﬁextremely hotﬂ. 
Extreme thermal event conditions and impacts are measured against local baselines. In 
this example, the relative threshold is based on the daily maximum temperature. The 
threshold value initially increases in the early part of the summer season and then declines 
from roughly mid-July through the end of September. As a result, a number of days in 

September would fail to satisfy the established fixed threshold criteria, yet would satisfy the 
relative threshold criteria for being considered extremely hot. Source: US EPA 2006. Excessive Heat Events Guidebook, http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/about/pdf/EHEguide_

These regions would be considered ﬁhotﬂ by many, with the heatwave further pushing up 

temperatures to over 50C in many regions. This heatwave was responsible for over 200 
deaths across the region (EM-DAT, 2008).

204Unlike other extreme weather events, it is difficult to visually convey the conditions during an extreme thermal event on the ground (e.g. heat ripples coming off surfaces, potential warping 

of train rails). These images attempt to visually convey what an extreme heat event in India 
during May 2003 looked like using satellite data for land temperatures. The focus is on the 
comparison of thermal images for part of India, in the box in the top image and the whole 
bottom image, with the temperatures recorded in the Sahara desert in Africa. During this event 
in India, temperatures in both areas were similar and were above 50°C.This is an example of using a fixed threshold criteria to identify extreme thermal conditions. Source: NASA 2008 Heat wave in southern India, 2003, http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.

observed. This approach looks for anomalies in health outcome data and then decides if 
the conditions are extreme. This can be used to identify thresholds for use in early warning 
systems. This approach is similar to the relative threshold idea but by considering health outcomes, it provides a focus on identifying conditions that are exceptional in a meteorological sense 
and that carry increased risk of adverse health risks/impacts. 21Identifying thermal extremes

that was used to define extreme heat conditions when developing an early warning

However, this comes at a price in terms of the sensitivity 

of results to the accuracy of the data provided and foregoing opportunities to identify 
extreme thermal conditions in advance. Weaknesses (
CLICK to appear) Considering the relative ease of access to accurate long-range meteorological forecasts 
(i.e., conditions two to three days out) this is an extremely high price to pay for certainty. 

At the same time, programmes designed to address these events should work to ensure 
the availability of health outcome data during an event because they can be used to help 
adjust the level and location of resources being committed to managing the event.23Options for identifying extreme thermal conditions

208The recommended approach to identifying extreme thermal events is to consider health outcome data along with meteorological data whenever possible. This approach has the

decisions for notification and response programmes.24Strengths:Accurate: any criteria will be based on periods of interest

25Who is vulnerable to 

thermal extremes?Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
210This slide provides a summary of characteristics that epidemiological studies, physiological studies, and studies of particular extreme heat events have identified as placing individuals 
at risk of experiencing adverse health outcomes during extreme thermal conditions, 
particularly extreme heat. Generally, any combination of factors that either increases 

exposures to high ambient temperatures or limits either the physical ability to respond to 
the conditions or the types of responses undertaken, will increase the risk of an adverse 
health outcome. 26Factors associated with increased vulnerabilityExtreme age: older &younger individuals

212In considering future health impacts of extreme thermal conditions, it is important to recognize that anticipated trends will increase many of the factors that affect the risk of 
experiencing adverse health outcomes, as listed on this slide. Larger and older populations, 
with more individuals at increased vulnerability because of chronic diseases, obesity, and 

other factors means more morbidity and mortality from extreme thermal events without 
climate change.28Factors increasing risk of thermal extremes in a changing climateLarger populations Larger elevated risk groups (old, young, poor)Expect more & more severe extreme heat eventsMay reach exposure thresholds without adaptationModule 5: Thermal extremes213A number of factors will work to reduce the risks of thermal extremes. A major issue with projecting future health outcomes from extreme thermal conditions is that the nature 
and effectiveness of future adaptation to these events is uncertain. Increases in standards 
of living, greater implementation of early warning and response systems, and adaptive 

responses can minimize future risks.A critical element of the success of these programmes is how well any messages and programme activities reach the most vulnerable, and how well these are taken up by 
vulnerable individuals and communities.29Factors reducing the risk of thermal extremes in a changing climateAnticipated increase in standard

214How do we assess the health risks and impacts of thermal extremes? We™ll focus on 
different assessment methods in section 4.30Assessing the 

health risks & 
impacts of thermal extremes4Module 5: Thermal extremes215As discussed earlier, excess health outcomes are the appropriate measure for quantifying 
the impacts of extreme thermal conditions. A significant drawback in basing estimates of 
health impacts attributable to the thermal exposure on only those health outcomes coded 
as being attributable to thermal conditions in ICD-10 codes is that they are generally 

believed to undercount the relevant health outcomes. Outcomes will be missed when, for 
example, high ambient temperature exacerbated a heart condition, causing a heart attack. 
Health care professionals would record the heart attack but are highly unlikely to include 
the heat as a contributing factor. Using all recorded outcomes and looking for the variation 

from baseline levels will provide a more comprehensive assessment of the total number of 
outcomes attributable to the heat.31Quantifying the health impacts of 
thermal extremesDevelop & use estimates of ‚excess™outcomes instead of counts based on listed medical condition codes for thermal exposureGenerate odds ratios or relative risk estimates for changes in thermal measures or combinations of meteorological conditions 
Conditional results can be generated (e.g. risk 

by age of persons a˜ected, by thermal threshold)Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
216Air mass-based studies approach the task of identifying thermal extremes and quantifying 
their impacts by first categorizing weather into combinations of characteristics 
distinguished mostly by heat and humidity levels. Different air mass groups are then 
evaluated for their relationship with health outcomes, with those having such a relationship 
being used to identify thermal extremes.Results of the analyses can then be used in early warning systems based on forecast weather data.32Quantifying health impacts in air mass-based studies
Air masses capture distinctions in weather considering multiple meteorological variables (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind speed) Map the air masses over the time period of interestCompare health outcomes, by air mass, with longer- term averagesAir masses with elevated outcome rates may identify
 extreme thermal conditionsRegression analysis can be used to predict health outcomes given conditions in an air massModule 5: Thermal extremes217This figure provides a hypothetical representation of what might be seen during and after an extreme thermal event. Note that EHE stands for extreme heat event. Key elements to 

note are the increase in daily mortality at approximately the start of the event with a peak 
at some point during the event (area marked in Blue as ﬁAﬂ). The height of the peak and 

the width of the base will generally be functions of the severity and duration of the event. Following the return to expected mortality at the end of an event, there is a smaller 
decrease in mortality below baseline conditions (area in yellow marked as ﬁBﬂ). This 

decline in mortality is because some of the individuals who died in the event would have 
died anyway within a few days; the event brought their deaths forward. This effect is 
described in the epidemiology literature as ﬁmortality displacementﬂ or ﬁharvestingﬂ. The 

greater the relative size of area ﬁAﬂ to area B, the greater the overall impact of the event. 
Note that while thermal extremes are expected to affect morbidity and mortality in a population, research has tended to focus on mortality. In large part this reflects the relative 

quality and accessibility of mortality data compared with acute health outcome data 
(e.g., emergency room or hospital visits).

34Potential impacts of thermal extremes5Module 5: Thermal extremes219These figures show how maximum temperatures could change in summer months (June, July, and August Œ JJA) over the course of the century under two emission scenarios. The 

analysis first determined the maximum temperature that occurred once every 20 years 
during the period 1985Œ2005. Then for the months June, July, and August for the time 

periods shown (next few decades, mid-century, and end of century), under a moderate 

and high emission scenario, the experiments determined how often that temperature 
could occur. The color bar at the bottom shows the absolute occurrences as the percent of 

years in each 20-year period. The frequency of occurrence of the 1986Œ2005 maximum 
JJA seasonal temperature value is, by definition, 5% at each grid point during the 20-year 
1986Œ2005 period.Within the next few decades, many regions in the low and mid-latitudes could experience 
the 1 in 20 year temperature up to every other year. By mid-century, even under the 

moderate emissions scenario, the temperature could occur every year. By the end of 

the century for both scenarios and under a high emissions scenario by mid-century, that 

temperature could occur every year.
The panels show the absolute occurrences as the percent of years in each 20-year period. The frequency of occurrence of the 1986Œ2005 maximum JJA seasonal temperature value 
is, by definition, 5 % at each grid point during the 20-year 1986Œ2005 period.Climate change will fundamentally change the nature of summer months.Source: Diffenbaugh NS, Giorgi F. Climate change hotspots in the CMIP5 global climate model ensemble.

Heatwaves are projected to be more intense, have longer durations and occur at a higher 
frequency and earlier in the year. Projections indicate that a sizable part of India will 

experience heat stress conditions in the future. Southern India, currently not influenced 
by heatwaves, is expected to be severely affected by the end of the twenty-first century. 

In northern India, the average number of days with extreme heat stress condition during 
pre-monsoon hot season could reach 30. The intensification of heat waves might lead to

determining the impact of extreme temperatures on health. With continued warming, the 

increase in humidity has been shown to pose increasingly severe limitations on human 
activity in tropical and mid-latitudes during peak months of heat stress.This study combined wet bulb globe temperatures from climate historical reanalysis and projections with industrial and military guidelines for an acclimated individual™s capacity 
to safely perform sustained labor under environmental heat stress (labor capacity); this 
was defined as a global population-weighted metric fixed at the 2010 distribution. The 
figure shows population-weighted individual labor capacity (%) during annual minimum 
(upper lines) and maximum (lower lines) heat stress months. The authors estimate that 
environmental heat stress has reduced labor capacity to 90% in peak months over the past 
few decades. Projections indicate reductions in labor capacity to 80% in peak months in 
2050. Under the highest emission scenario considered, projections indicate reductions in 
labor capacity to less than 40% by 2200, with most tropical and mid-latitudes experiencing 
extreme climatological heat stress.The inset graph shows labor capacity by wet bulb globe temperature.Source: Dunne et al. Reductions in labor capacity from heat stress under climate warming. Nature Climate

236The risks of extreme weather and climate events depend on three factors:the nature and severity of the event;the extent to which a community is exposed to the event; and the vulnerability of the exposed community and region.Because the extent of exposure and the underlying vulnerability vary from place to place, the same strength event will have different consequences in different locations. This slide can be used to ask the participants about recent extreme weather and climate events in their countries. Ask for descriptions not only of the event, but how local factors 
increased or decreased vulnerability.

238Munich Re collects data worldwide data on catastrophes. Depending on their financial and human impact, events are assigned to one of six loss categories, from a small-scale loss 

event to a great natural catastrophe. The categories depend on the numbers of fatalities, 
how many were affected (such as being homeless), the extent of economic loss, and 
whether interregional and/or international assistance was necessary. 
Events are categorized as geophysical, meteorological (storms), hydrological (floods), climatological (extreme temperature), and extraterrestrial (meteorites). This shows the 880 
loss events in 2013. Source: Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Gesellschaft. 2014. 2013 Natural Catastrophe Year in Review

240EM-DAT is the international disaster database maintained by the Centre for Research on 
the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) in Belgium. The main objective of the database is 
to serve the purposes of humanitarian action at national and international levels. EM-DAT 

contains data on the occurrence and effects of over 18 000 mass disasters from 1900 
to the present. The database is complied from various sources, including UN agencies, 
NGOs, insurance companies, research institutes, and press agencies. For a disaster to 

be entered into the database at least one of the following must be fulfilled: 10 or more 
people reported killed; 100 or more people reported affected; declaration of a state of 
emergency; or a call or international assistance. This shows the percent share of reported victims by disaster sub-group. Asia is particularly 
vulnerable to hydrological and meteorological disasters.10Source: EM-DAT (2012)Meteorological= stormClimatological= extreme temperature, drought, wild˜reHydrological= ˚ood Percent share of reported victims by disaster sub-group & continent in 2012Module 6: Extreme weather241These data are from the IPCC Special Report on Extreme Events.

highlighting their higher vulnerability because of, among other factors, poorer quality 

infrastructure, urban planning, and early warning systems.

242This shows the trends in natural catastrophes worldwide from 1980 to 2012. The number of events increased over time, at least in part because of more people living in harm™s way. 

Geophysical events (in red) have varied over time, with no discernable trend. This is not the case for the other categories, all of which are associated with weather and climate. Obviously not all catastrophes are related to climate change. But meteorological, hydrological, and climatological events Œ the green, blue and yellow bars - increased 
over the 30+ year period. The increases were largest for meteorological and hydrological 
events.Source: Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Gesellschaft. 2014. 2013 Natural Catastrophe Year in Review

More people are moving into harm™s way. The example shown is the 2010 flooding in 

Pakistan that left more than 6 million people homeless.

246Many low- and middle-income countries have infrastructure that is vulnerable to extreme 
events, thus increasing economic losses when an event occurs. The IPCC Special Report 
on Extreme Events found that economic losses as a proportion of GDP from extreme 
events were highest in middle-income countries. As countries develop, their infrastructure 

becomes more valuable but may not have been designed and built to withstand extremes.16Flooding: China 2013digi201ChiiModule 6: Extreme weather247So what we™ve been seen across these graphs is this general situation relating to hazards Œ that– READ17Summary: Trends in hazardsMore hazardous weather and climate events

period 1970-2008 from extreme weather events by country. 
This shows nearly 800 000 reported deaths from extreme weather events. Storm mortality was by far the largest cause of death from extreme weather events, at 84% of the total.Looking at the data for different countries, you can see that impacts are not equally distributed by country or type of extreme event.20Deaths from extreme weather events in

reported number of deaths per household was 2.2 with 66% of the victims women. The 
most significant health need was support for psychological stress: 23% of people reported 
psychological problems after the cyclone.In the areas affected, two thirds of health facilities suffered some damage. One out of five was totally destroyed. Most were small, rural primary care centers. The estimated cost for 
rebuilding health facilities was estimated at US$2 billion. After the cyclone, 60% of people had no access to clean water as traditional sources of water in villages became contaminated with seawater. In addition, many water sources 

became polluted due to the breakdown of sanitation facilities in the flooded areas.27Cyclone Nargis hits Myanmar, 2008New York Times (2008)The Guardian (2008)Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
258A unique risk in the Himalayas is glacial lake outburst floods. As glaciers melt, the water collects in naturally occurring moraines. As they fill, the pressure of the water on the 
retaining walls can become too great, causing the walls to fail. Such glacial lake outburst 
floods have caused significant damage, with an increasingly large number of lakes at risk.28Danger of glacial lake outburst ˜ood

a major cause of impacts from extreme events.Source: Bloomberg News, Nov 2014.

extreme weather and climate events.(This image shows low lying villages on the island of Kiribati, threatened by rising sea levels with climate change.)32Sources of 

vulnerability
Module 6: Extreme weather263A wide range of factors affect individual vulnerability to an extreme event. Many of them are written here (let the group read them over the next 20 seconds).Q: With the person next to you, have a chat for 3 minutes about why you think these factors increase vulnerability to climate change impacts.Call people back together and acknowledge the points contributed and add in any of the explanatory points below if they™re not covered:

264This slide further emphasizes the importance of understanding vulnerability. One of 
the key conclusions of the IPCC Special Report on Extremes was that it doesn™t take an 

extreme weather and climate event to create an extreme impact. The example is from 
Zimbabwe, which has very high vulnerability because of a weak health system, limited 
investment in public health infrastructure (particularly sanitation), and other factors. By the 
end of Nov 2008, three of Zimbabwe™s four major hospitals had shut down, along with 
the Zimbabwe Medical School. The fourth major hospital has two wards and no working 
operating theatre. The urban water supply, sanitation, and garbage collection systems had 

collapsed. Due to the economic crisis, most households could not afford fuel to boil water.
In August 2008, cholera was introduced. Africa™s largest cholera oubreak started following 
the onset of seasonal rains, with over 90 000 people affected and more than 4000 
deaths. In Feb 2009, approximately 8000 cases were reported weekly. Cholera spread to 

Botswana, Mozambique, and Zambia. The outbreak was contained in mid-2009.Source: IPCC. 2012. Special Report on Extreme Events.

266Direct health impacts of an extreme event are those that arise from the event itself (e.g., drowning from a cyclone). These impacts typically provide the information that is 

subsequently used to describe the event (e.g., so many dead and so many hospitalized).
CLICK to display second section on mental health impacts
Mental health impacts of extreme weather events are increasingly being recognized as a significant category of direct health impacts. There is often delayed onset of mental health 
impacts; these can have long-lasting effects on productivity and quality of life.

vectorborne diseases in pools of water created by floodwaters. Indirect impacts generally 
occur after the event. Understanding these indirect impacts is important for ensuring 
health systems are prepared to conduct surveillance and monitoring, and for ensuring that 

health care workers have the necessary training and that adequate supplies are available.37Indirect public health impacts from

268This slide again highlights that climate change-based projections of the magnitude and 
pattern of future extreme events are only part of the information needed to estimate how 
health risks could change with changing weather patterns. Development pathways will be 
a strong determinant of future risks. Population growth and age distribution are easier to 

project than are other important factors, such as health status. Because the poor bear a 
disproportionate share of health impact, considering how economic growth and inequity 
might evolve are important considerations, as are the number and distribution of low-

income populations. Improving the quality of life of the poor can provide health benefits. 
The role of adaptation must be considered when predicting future health risks.38Climate change & health risks of future extreme weather eventsIncreases in health risk may or may not result 
from future extreme weather events in a changing climate.Single events 
could have a minimal or signi˜cant health impactsSocio-demographic changes in population location, size, health, & wealth can be as signi˜cant as climate change in altering future risks
Adaptation, in the form of hazard planning, preparation& response, will play a critical role 
in determining the magnitude 
of future health risks from 
extreme weather events

270When planning for how to increase resilience to extreme weather and climate events, an important consideration is that effective risk management and adaptation options 
are designed and implemented taking into consideration the unique vulnerabilities and 
exposure to hazards of each region. In some situations, the most important policies and 
measures are those that reduce vulnerability (instead of focusing on extreme weather and 
climate events). Source: IPCC. 2012. Special Report on Extreme Events.

for increasing resilience to the risks. Planning should include local / national disaster risk 
management committees, NGOs such as the Red Cross, and other stakeholders working 
to increase resilience to extreme events. Creating hypothetical scenarios and holding drills 
can develop the networks and teamwork needed to manage an event.CLICK slide changer to animate each of these goals one by one, reading each41Goals for extreme weather event noti˜cation & response plansImprove public understanding of the

disease™, ‚pathogen™ and ‚Zoonotic infections™ for the first time in the module, ensure that a 

definition is provided and people are comfortable in their understanding of the term, before 
moving on.Remind participants that they can refer to the glossary if they need to refer back to key terms and their meaning. 
The case studies of the impacts of climate change on malaria and dengue will likely be compelling for participants, so if there is interest, make sure time is allowed for discussion.

2844Let™s start by looking at a general introduction to vector-borne diseases.
Introduction to vector-borne disease (VBD)Module 7: Vector-borne diseases & climate change
2855VBDs are diseases that are spread by arthropod or small animal vectors. Vectors act as the main mode of transmission of infection from one host to another and as 
such form an essential stage in the transmission cycle.What is vector-borne disease?Diseases that are spread by arthropod 
or small animal vectors. Vectors act as the main 
mode of transmission of infection from one host to 
another, &as such, form an essential stage in the transmission cycle.
Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
286Two main types of VBD transmission exist:
1. Anthroponotic infections Œ or human-vector-human transmissions, where humans 
are the only reservoir of the disease2. Zoonotic infections Œ or animal-vector-human transmission, where animals are the 
main reservoir of the disease and humans are considered secondary or spillover hosts and do not generally contribute to the disease transmission cycle as their 
levels of circulating pathogen are often too low to help maintain transmission.The type of transmission of a VBD has implications for control strategies. Anthroponotic 
infections can theoretically be eradicated if all human cases of the disease can be treated, 
whereas zoonotic diseases are much more difficult to control since all animal reservoirs of 
the disease would need to be treated.Types of VBD transmissionHuman-vector-human

Most arboviraldiseases (e.g. WNV)6Module 7: Vector-borne diseases & climate change
287There are 3 crucial elements which must co-exist for the occurrence of VBD: 
1. The susceptible population
2. The vector (most often arthropods), and 

3. The disease pathogen (e.g., bacteria, virus, parasite). 
In areas where VBD most frequently occurs, conditions must be suitable for vectors and pathogens, which implies physiologically suitable conditions for vector, host, and pathogen survival and 

reproduction/replication. There are a number of areas in the world where conditions may be suitable for all three components; however, other factors have acted to prevent or eradicate disease transmission in these areas, perhaps as 

a result of improved health care services or vector control measures.Global climate change is likely to affect all 3 of these components both directly and indirectly. As an 
example of direct effects: Arthropods are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation as 
they cannot regulate their own internal temperatures and are therefore critically dependent on climate 
for survival and development (Githeko et al., 2000). Changes in climate may accelerate the development 
time of some arthropod species, for example. Similarly, many pathogens are climate sensitive as well, and changes in climate could result in increased 
reproduction rates of some pathogens.Some example of indirect effects might include: Changes in livelihood conditions due to climate change, which could affect nutritional status of individuals, thereby potentially increasing susceptibility to disease.The next section will cover indirect and direct effects of climate change on human health in more detail.7Vector-borne disease dynamicsSusceptible populationMigration (forced)Vector environmentVectorSurvival, lifespanReproduction/breeding pattern

288Which vector-borne diseases are of most concern?
There are many VBDs of concern, especially in developing countries, a number of which are on the WHO list of neglected tropical diseases because they occur in areas where 
poverty is the most significant risk factor for their occurrence. These include Leishmaniasis, 
Trypanosomiasis, Chagas, Dengue, Lymphatic filariasis, and Onchocerciasis.
The agents causing these diseases are protozoa, bacteria, viruses and filarial nematodes, and are transmitted by a range of arthropod vectors.Let™s first look at Protozoan agents and their associated disease, pathogens, vectors and transmission type.

292In terms of direct effects, climate has the potential to:1. Increase the range or abundance of both animal reservoirs and arthropod vectors.
 There is some emerging evidence of this occurring with Schistosomiasis in China and malaria in 
the Kenyan Highlands.
2. Climate change may also prolong the length of the transmission cycles of disease or the 
transmission season of diseases. West Nile virus (WNV), which has recently appeared in North America, has an amplification 
cycle involving mosquitoes and avian reservoir hosts. Human risk of infection is highest late in the summer when mosquito population densities are highest. Warmer spring and fall 

temperatures could increase the transmission season of the disease, thereby shifting the risk of 
human infection of the disease earlier in the summer.
3. Climate could also increase the likelihood of successful importation of disease vectors and 
animal host reservoirs. For example, the global spread of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, which has been 
linked to the sale of used tires around the world, was linked to an outbreak of chikungunya 

virus, a dengue-like virus in Italy in 2007. Importation of a suitable animal reservoir is believed 

to be one of the possible methods of introduction of WNV to North America in the late 1990s.4. As mentioned previously, climate change effects resulting in increased animal incidence of 
disease are likely to increase the risk of human disease as well.Source: Greer, A., V. Ng, and D. Fisman. 2008. Climate change and infectious diseases in North America:

293Temperature can affect both the distribution of the vector and the effectiveness of 
pathogen transmission through the vector. 
Gubler et al. (2001) list a range of possible mechanisms whereby changes in temperature impact on the risk of transmission of VBD:Temperature may act to:

295Precipitation can also have a number of effects on vectors.Gubler et al. 2001 highlight that:
Precipitation effects could include:Increased surface water thereby providing increased breeding sites for vectorsDecreased rainfall could also increase breeding sites by slowing river flowIncreased rain could increase vegetation and allow expansion in populations of vertebrate hostFlooding could eliminate habitat for both vectors and vertebrate hostsFlooding could also force vertebrate hosts into closer contact with humans.15VectorSurvival: increased rain may increase larval habitat Excess rain can eliminate habitat by ˜oodingLow rainfall can create habitat as rivers dry into pools (dry season malaria)Decreased rain can increase container-breeding

296Precipitation Œ and particularly humidity with precipitation - can also effects the development of malarial parasites. (If asked: In this image shown in blue are Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites in the sexual, gametocyte stage of development. In red are uninfected red blood cells.)16PathogenFew direct e˜ects but some data on humidity e˜ects on malarial parasite development Source: Gubleret al. (2001)Photo: Science DailyModule 7: Vector-borne diseases & climate change
297Humidity and precipitation can also have a significant role in vector activity. A greater 
relative humidity can increase vector activity, but heavy rainfall can actually decrease 

activity. 
Increased activity increases transmission rates. Source: Ogden N.H., M. Bigras-Poulin, C.J. O™Callaghan, I.K. Barker, L.R. Lindsay, A. Maarouf, K.E. Smoyer-

298Relationship between temperature and vector mortality is quadratic: mortality rates increase at high and low temperatures.Temperature effects on development may affect mortality rates: particularly high rates 
of development of mosquitoes can result in small adults with poorer survival. This is one 
example where the terms in epidemiological models of VBDs interact with one another. 

Another important interaction is the dependence of transmission coefficients for tick-borne 

pathogens on the numbers of vectors feeding on the host. The understanding of such 
interactions is, however, largely rudimentary.
When relative humidity is low, ticks have to make more frequent, energy-expensive trips 
to the litter layer to rehydrate. High ﬁmonsoonﬂ rainfall knocks ticks off the herbage and 

prevents them from finding a host.Lower humidity  the energy requirement for host seeking by ticks shortening their lives.*
Lower rainfall  breeding areas for mosquitoes, compounded by density-dependent 
intraspecific competition amongst larvae.

299Many VBDs are zoonotic and have life cycles that are fully maintained in wildlife.In these diseases, seasons often play a very important role in the relationships between vectors and hosts.19Vector & host seasonalityVector-borne zoonoses mostly maintained by wildlife Vectors & their hosts are subject to seasonal 
variations that are climate related (e.g. temperature) & climate independent 
(e.g. day-length)
Seasonal variations a˜ect abundance & demographic processes of both vectors & hostsClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
300Both vectors and hosts have seasonal variations in their life cycles driven by seasonal changes in climate and climate independent effects such as day length.Vectors can be affected by the way in which temperature can change from season 

to season, with resultant impacts on their development, activity, and disease 

transmission role. The lifecycle and activity level of the host can be affected as well, affecting how 
fast infected or immune animals die and how fast uninfected animals are borne, 
with resultant impacts on the epidemiology of vector-borne zoonoses.

303A study by Pascual et al. (2006) reviewed temperature data for the past 50 years in East 
Africa to examine the role of climate in exacerbating incidence of endemic malaria in 
the Eastern highlands of Kenya where increases in malaria have been observed since the 

1970s.Their analysis found evidence for significant warming at all sites and an applied dynamic model suggested that biological responses, such as those by the vector and pathogen, 
would also be magnified by at least 1 order of magnitude under climate warming.
The map you see in the slide shows the different areas of Kenya and the different 
incidence rates. The bright red portion of the map shows an area with endemic malaria.

305To finish off this section on the direct effects of climate change on VBD™s, a quick recap:
The major ways in which climate change is likely to impact VBD include:1. Increasing the range or abundance of animal reservoir and arthropod vectors

2. Prolonging the transmission cycle of disease

3. Increasing the likelihood of successful importation of disease vectors or animal 
reservoirs4. Increasing the animal disease risk and potential human risks of disease.
We™ll next look at some case studies of the influence of climate change on vector-borne 
disease.25ˇClimate change has the potential to: Increase range or abundance of animal reservoirs &/or arthropod vectors

Module 7: Vector-borne diseases & climate change
307In 2014, 97 countries and territories had ongoing malaria transmission.An estimated 3.3 billion people are at risk of malaria, of whom 1.2 billion are at high risk. In high-risk areas, more than one malaria case occurs per 1000 population.There were an estimated 198 million cases of malaria worldwide (range 124Œ283 million) in 2013, and an estimated 584 000 deaths (range 367 000Œ755 000). 90% of all malaria deaths occur in Africa.Between 2000 and 2013, an expansion of malaria interventions helped to reduce malaria incidence by 30% globally, and by 34% in Africa.
During the same period, malaria mortality rates decreased by an estimated 47% worldwide and by 54% in Africa. In the under-five age group, mortality rates have declined by 53% globally, and by 58% in Africa.
This is a map of the current distribution of malaria transmission.
Transmission zones are highly dependent on climate. Localized transmission is affected by regional factors (such 
as type of vegetation, health services, vector control), but the global ranges are predominantly affected by climate. 
The key areas of importance for climate change will be changes (loss or appearance) of incidence at the margins of 
these ranges, where climate suitability for the vector and/or pathogen are currently marginal, and where small shifts 
in climate may push the transmission potential of the disease above or below the required threshold.There will likely be areas of decline and areas of emergenceImpacts are likely to depend on localized factors and a combination of climate and socioeconomic 
conditionsRisk will increase the most on the fringes of malarial transmission, but control is generally good in these 
areasImpacts will likely remain highest in currently endemic areas, where control is poor and vulnerability is 
high.Source: WHO, 2014. World Malaria Report 2014

308The effect of climate change on malaria remains in debate.But malaria is an extremely climate sensitive disease. Clearly transmission does not occur in climates where mosquitoes cannot survive. Optimal larval development occurs at 28°C and optimal adult 
development between 28 and 32°C, as you can see in this temperature and development graph on the 
right. Transmission cannot occur below 16°C or above 33°C as sporogony (the production of sporozoites 

which comprises dissemination and development of the parasite in the vector) cannot take place.The effect of global warming on malaria may be felt most in areas that are currently on the edges of the range of infected mosquitoes (Patz and Olson, 2006). These include many of the densely populated 

highland regions in Africa that are surrounded by lowland areas where malaria is endemic. Small changes 
may therefore lead to the exposure of many people to malaria.Many global warming scenarios include an increase in the frequency and intensity of the El Niño phenomenon (Patz et al., 2002) such as storms, heavy rain, droughts, and warm temperature. El Niño 

seasons have been associated, although not always, with outbreaks of malaria in many areas (ref Atul). 
Therefore it seems reasonable to speculate that the intensification of El Niño effects due to global 
warming will facilitate local epidemics of malaria. Source: Macdonald, G. 1957. The Epidemiology and Control of Malaria. Oxford University Press, London, UK.

309This slide will examine the role of climate impacts on the vector, the pathogen, and humans.
Vector:

The malaria vector is the Anopheles mosquito. Several key transmission variables can be affected by climate. Most important are the climatic requirements for survival. Different species require different temperature ranges. Key vector factors:
Climatic requirements for survivalTemperature ranges for different species
Standing water and humidity requirementsInsecticide resistance (e.g., DDT).
Pathogen:

The malaria pathogen is the Plasmodium parasite. Common species include P. falciparum, P. vivax, 
and P. malariae
. The pathogen requires a certain temperature for reproduction. Human population:
The human population can be affected by climate and the environment as well. Climatic change can affect the ability of the human population to access medical treatment. Climate can also affect patterns of human movement, 
contributing to the spread of transmission to new areas.Key human population factors:
Poverty and other social determinants of health
Acquired immunityAccess to medical treatmentResilience capacity: knowledge of how environmental factors affect malaria (i.e water management).29HumanPathogenEnvironment

310The figure shows a predictive map for malaria according to multiple environmental factors. These maps predict that P. vivax malaria mainly occurs in the south-eastern part 

of P.R. China with the risk of malaria increasing steadily from north to south. Comparison 

between different decades shows that there is a high probability that variables suitable for 
malaria transmission will shift northwards, mainly driven by relative humidity (RH)In the southern and south-eastern region of China where is the high risk areas for malaria 
transmission, the passive and active surveillance approaches identified. In the central 
region where is the climate sensitive zone to the malaria transmission, an appropriate 
surveillance-response approach is necessary to develop. In the north-eastern region where 

is potential malaria emerging regions due to climate change, the continuous surveillance 
and monitoring is warranted.Source: Yang et al. Malaria Journal 2012, Malaria surveillance-response strategies in different transmission

dioxide in the atmosphere, conditions for pests also change. The primary Malaria agent, 
the falciparum malaria parasite, will be able to spread into new areas, as displayed in this

312The next case study that we will discuss is dengue. Dengue is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease, showing a 30-fold 
increase in global incidence over the past 50 years (WHO, 2013). Each year there occur 

about 390 million dengue infections worldwide, of which roughly 96 million manifest with 
symptoms (Bhatt et al., 2013). Three quarters of the people exposed to dengue are in the 
Asia-Pacific region.
32Case Study 2: DengueModule 7: Vector-borne diseases & climate change
313This is the current area at risk of dengue transmission in more detail. The lines represent January and July isotherms and demarcate the area where the vector for dengue exists. Climate change is likely to shift these isotherms farther north above the equator and farther south below the equator, thereby potentially increasing the size of the area at risk of 

dengue transmission.Source: WHO. 2008. World Health Organization Map, Countries/areas at risk of dengue transmission.

314Dengue is an important mosquito-born disease, with about 2.5 billion people at risk 
worldwide. The Aedes
 spp. mosquito vectors are well adapted to the urban environment and thrive well in a warm, humid environment. Viral replication in the vector increases 

with temperature, with expected temperature-related effects on transmission. Minimal 

transmission temperature for the dengue virus is 12°C. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) outbreak in southern Sumatra was accompanied by more extreme weather due to El Niño effects (Corwin et al., 2001).Linked to future climate change projections, a small rise in temperature in temperate regions will increase the potential for future epidemics, given a susceptible population and 
introduction of the virus.Sources: 1Vezzani D., S.M. Velazquez, and N. Schweigmann. 2004. Seasonal pattern of abundance of Aedes

Module 8: Water-borne diseases
3315Water is related with development of diseases in various ways. 
The most common mode of transmission is waterborne diseases. It is transmission of fecal-orally transmitted infectious diseases through ingestion of water contaminated by human 
or animal faeces or urine containing pathogenic bacteria, viruses or parasites. However, transmission of faecal-orally transmitted diseases can develop from shortage 
of water, in case of long-term shortage of water, lowered hygiene level may provide 

more opportunity for the pathogens by direct person-to-person route. Those waterborne 

diseases with winter or dry season peak may be related with this type of transmission. In some infectious disease such as legionellosis, microbe proliferates in water and infects human who inhaled the aerosol.In some parasitic infestations in which the intermediate vectors are water-living organism, 
water can be a media of transmission of disease. In many mosquito-borne infectious diseases, presence of stationary water mass is an 
essential condition for the survival of the larva. In this group of diseases, rainfall is very 
important determinant of the disease transmission.Water-related diseasesCategory Transmission Disease examples Water-borne Ingestion of water contaminated

334While the first goal, as stated in the previous slide, of determining human health end points (morbidity) in relation to climate change parameters can be measured in the 
absence of information about specific factors in transmission, an understanding of the 
specific mechanisms that link the climate parameter to the pathogen and transmission 
route, require an understanding of how a climate parameter acts on specific pathways.This flow chart illustrates the points at which we might start to investigate the mechanisms that provide the link between a climate signal and a disease. It is evident even in this relatively simple chart that the pathways from source to exposure can be complex. While we are interested in the human health end points (at the far right 
of the chart), many of these diarrheal diseases are zoonotic and, therefore, transmission 
pathways must include both human and animal contamination. The pathogens can be 
transmitted from person to person (in some cases), or indirectly through contamination of 
food products, groundwater, and surface water.

335As preface to any discussion of water and foodborne disease trends, it is important to point out current and predicted changes in the water cycle.Both water quality and water quantity are significant issues. 
Across large areas of the globe, many of which are in lesser developed nations, freshwater sources are already vulnerable due to a combination of contamination and inadequate 
supply. 
Many of the predicted trends are for increased areas of drought leading to desertification, decreased crop production and food scarcity, along with increasing water sanitation 

problems associated with increasing demand placed on a diminishing supply of water.

337Overlaying the issues of water stress both from flooding and drought is the fact that water-
borne and foodborne diseases continue to be significant causes of morbidity and mortality 
world-wide. Among the wide spectrum of diseases that are associated with food and especially water, 
gastroenteritis is the most commonly identified illness. These diarrheal diseases contribute 
to as many as 4 million cases annually and 1.8 million deaths. Of these cases, 88% can be

338Diarrheal diseases are a significant global health problem and, as this chart shows, they are the largest contributor to water-borne disease burden world-wide. 
Given the global problem associated with diarrheal diseases and its common association with water, our discussion of climate and water-borne disease will focus primarily on 

enteric pathogens and gastroenteritis.In the figure also note the relative significance of Drownings as a source of DALYs.

339Despite the global burden of diarrheal diseases, they remain vastly under-reported even 
in nations with highly developed surveillance systems. This is related to multiple factors 
including lack of diagnosis, lack of specimen collection, lack of reporting, and lack of 

treatment sought. This translates into what is known as the ﬁtip of the icebergﬂ scenario 
where very few of the actual number of cases of gastroenteritis are ever reported and 
etiology determined. For something like salmonellosis, among the most common bacterial 

sources of gastroenteritis world-wide, the actual number of cases is estimated to be 38-fold 
greater than the numbers that are reported.The lack of good health data for diarrheal diseases is a common problem for investigating food and water-borne disease, especially when attempting to find associations with 

environmental and climate drivers. Source: Mead et al. 1999. Food-related illness and death in the United States. Emerg Infect Dis 5(5):607Œ625

340In fact, the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (Working Group II) indicates that the burden of 
diarrheal disease will increase as climate changes over the next century. The magnitude of 

food and waterborne infections are expected to be increased very high by the end of 21st 
century, next to the undernutrition. Moreover, proportion of the risk that is preventable 

with high adaptation is smaller.

341While projections include increasing diarrheal disease as the global climate changes, at local levels we are already witnessing disease events that can be linked to climate. This 
map and descriptions (figure from Hall et al., 2002) indicate some of these weather or 
climate linked water-borne disease events from around the world. We will touch upon 

some of these in more detail.According to updated estimation of burden of diarrhoeal disease by WHO, overall 
premature deaths will increase up to 66 403 (51 032-86275) in 2030 and 63442 (54 110Œ
81 330) in 2050. Economic growth is closely related to the deaths from diarrhoeal disease, 
resulting in decreasing tendency of deaths in the future expectations.Source: Drawn from Table 4.7, Kovats S, Lloyd S. Diarrhoeal disease In: Hales S, Kovats S, Lloyd S, Campbell-

342Let™s now look at how climate & weather affects diarrhoeal diseases & food- & water-
borne pathogens.Of the critical issues in studying the specific impacts of climate on health, and specifically the impacts on water-borne disease, are the need to (1) identify broad trends in disease 

outcome, and (2) identify mechanisms that lead to these trends, especially in terms of the 
biology and physiology of specific pathogens.15How climate & weather a˜ects water-borne disease
Module 8: Water-borne diseases
343As we begin to shift to a discussion of how water-borne diseases may be impacted by 
climate variability and change, we need to focus a bit on climate change scenarios and 
which climate parameters are expected to have the greatest impact on water-borne 

pathogens and diseases.We will go through each of these mechanisms in detail next, and provide some specific 
examples of research that is addressing these issues. Where possible, examples of the two 
ways of examining climate change impacts will be addressed - that is, studies that look at 
specific health end points and studies that address mechanisms or pathways.So, as shown in this table, climate change scenarios predict:Rising temperaturesChanges in the hydrological cycles (especially frequency of high intensity storms and drought)Other extreme events, including tropical cyclones and interannual variability 
associated with pressure shifts over large areas of oceans, which result in far 
reaching changes in precipitation and temperature patterns (e.g., El Niño Southern 

Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, among others)

344These expected changes will certainly impact many sectors, but these parameters are expected to impact water-borne pathogens both directly (i.e., temperature) indirectly (i.e., 

rainfall and flooding).They can also affect a wide range of enteric pathogens, especially those with an environmental reservoir.
Specific parameters within climate change scenarios that are likely to affect water-borne 
disease were mentioned earlier. Now we will take those parameters and narrow them 

down to specific impacts, which include:Another issue that is more difficult to measure or predict is range expansion, either for a specific pathogen or for hosts in zoonotic pathogens.As we investigate specific disease patterns, it is important to keep in mind that many of these waterborne/diarrheal diseases often display marked seasonal patterns. In some 
cases, the evidence of seasonality and information related to the drivers of seasonality 
can be used as a starting point to inform further investigations into the longer-term trends 

associated with climate change.We™ll now go into four of these influences Œ Seasons, Temperature, Precipitation and Sea-
Level Rise - one by one, with examples drawn from Asia and the Pacific.

345The first area of impact of climate and weather on diarrhoeal diseases and food- and water-borne diseases is seasons.

346This chart of hospitalization rates for children with rotavirus infections shows the powerful trends in seasonality that are evident in many enteric (diarrheal) diseases. Here we can see trends by latitude for the 99 studies since 1995 from Americas, Europe and Africa, and Asia and Oceania. Data are presented for each column from north to south.In all regions, rotavirus rates become increasing modal as latitudes increase, with the highest rates in the winter months for temperate zones in both the northern and southern hemispheres. In the lower 
latitudes of the tropics, this marked seasonality is damped down and finally, in the equatorial zones, 

there is almost no seasonality.
This series of charts does not indicate relative rates of infection between these areas, but it clearly shows that disease trends vary less by season in the warmest parts of the world. While this cannot 
be used to predict future scenarios, this is the kind of evidence that can be used to guide specific 
investigations into possible disease trends under a changing climate. For example, if seasonality is 

related to temperature, can we expect an expansion of the tropical patterns into temperate areas?Another factor is socioeconomic status. Series of charts on the right side shows a difference in the magnitude of seasonality between countries with different economic status. Lower-income countries 

have more prominent seasonality pattern. While this slide shows baseline information for posing questions about disease trends and climate change, the next series of slides will illustrate how these next questions might be addressed.Source: Patel et al. 2013.

347In the next few slides we will move onto specific diarrheal diseases, with a focus on Salmonella infections. This make up the most common causes of bacterial-associated gastroenteritis world-
wide. These bacteria are also zoonotic, found commonly among both livestock and wild-life 
populations, and they also both show a similar seasonality with distinct peaks in reported cases 
occurring in the summer months, world-wide.Kovats et al. have investigated these trends across continental scales to determine the 
contribution of temperature to disease incidence.In this figure, reported cases (solid line) are plotted with mean weekly temperature (dotted line) for nine countries. All show striking similar trends with peak salmonellosis cases occurring 
within one week of peak annual temperatures. An estimated threshold level of 6°C was determined for the studied nations, such that the response to temperature was linear for temperatures greater than 6°C. Using this scenario, the 
authors found that as much as 41% of the cases could be attributable to climate (temperature).Source: Kovats et al. 2004. The effect of temperature on food poisoning: a time-series analysis of salmonellosis

348In addition to consistent patterns between temperature and peak incidence of disease across very wide geographic ranges, Salmonella infection also displays similar trends across latitudinal ranges.In this figure, the rates of reported cases of salmonellosis show an increasing trend as you move toward territories in the lower latitudes in Australia. The trends are consistent with 
higher mean annual temperatures.Source: Hall et al. 2002. Foodborne disease in the new millennium: out of the frying pan and into the fire?

356The major issues associated with flooding that influence water-borne disease include:
Direct exposure/contact with contaminated water. Following large flood events, sewage 
overflows and failed septic systems are common and can result in contaminated standing 
water. Direct exposure to flood waters commonly lead to infections of the skin, respiratory 

system, eyes, and ears.Floods can also result in contaminated water sources and gastroenteritis due to ingestion of untreated or insufficiently treated water.
Floods can also facilitate the secondary spread of disease due to poor hygiene following flood events and the displacement of people.28Flooding: Risk factors

358In looking at the end point of outbreaks of water-borne disease in association with rainfall,

were preceded by rainfall events in the 80th percentile, on a watershed level. Associations 
were noted for both surface water and groundwater.

to Campylobacter and E. coli O157:H7 infections.This outbreak was linked to faecal contamination in a groundwater well. Although inquiries 
showed a breakdown in the multiple barrier approach to water protection, the outbreak

India.Like both E. coli and Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium
 is a zoonotic agent and is often associated with cattle, water fowl, and other reservoirs that can contribute to contamination, in addition to human waste. Results from this study indicate that infections 
from both human specific strains (C. hominis) and zoonotic strains (i.e., C. parvum
) follow similar patterns with increasing incidence with increased rainfall. This illustrates that 
contamination from run-off with either human or animal waste results in clinical cases.

363While there are fewer specific studies relating water-borne disease incidence to drought 
and projection of changes in disease incidence with drier conditions, it is accepted that 
reductions in water supply can be expected to result in increasing pressures on limited 
water sources. Additionally, as water sources are more limited they potentially experience 

increasing concentrations of pathogens due to a variety of influences, including increased 
water use for multiple purposes and the contribution of wastewater (treated or untreated) 
to the total water volume.The effects of reservoir storage volume on water quality in general is noted in this figure. When volume is at 20% or less of capacity, all users will experience water quality issues.

365The fourth area of impact of climate and weather on diarrhoeal diseases and food- and water-borne diseases is sea level rise. 
Sea levels are expected to rise world-wide, associated with both melting glaciers, polar ice caps, and thermal expansion.The effects of sea level rise will impact coastal zones via periodic flooding (storm surge) as well as incremental rise in water level. These will result in a decrease in fresh water 
availability, loss of infrastructure (due to flooding), and an influx of marine pathogens.

367Among the bacteria, Vibrio species also show a strong seasonal trend, with the highest cases reported in summer months, and a direct relationship with increasing temperatures.This genus includes common marine species, only a few of which are pathogenic to humans; however, among this group are three significant pathogens Œ 
V. vulnificus
, V. 
parahaemolyticus, and V. cholerae. 
All of these replicate in the marine or estuarine environment, especially at warm 
water temperatures (growth begins at temperatures > 15°C). Both V. vulnificus 
and V. 
parahaemolyticus infections are commonly associated with shellfish. V. cholerae 
is unique in its ability to grow in fresh waters and can be transmitted through drinking water. 

Additionally, 
V. cholerae
 is unique in its ability to be transmitted person-to-person.
Because these are primarily ﬁenvironmentalﬂ bacteria rather than primarily ﬁentericﬂ and they proliferate easily in the environment, more is known about the mechanisms linking 
climate drivers to the pathogen itself.

368Because the Vibrio species are native marine bacteria, this group may be expected to be among the primary concerns with water-borne disease associated with sea level rise. In 
many areas of the world that are particularly prone to sea level rise (many parts of south 
Asia), cholera (V. cholerae
) is already an ongoing problem.Because cholera has both an environmental (water) and human host (gut) life stage, 
outbreaks can be initiated or perpetuated by either influx of estuarine water or by 
wastewater contamination (during outbreaks).We know much about the mechanisms that result in 
V. cholerae
 growth in the environment and how it may intersect with various climate or weather parameters.V. cholerae 
proliferates:in warm watersin association with planktonAdditionally, cholera outbreaks are linked tightly with monsoon seasons (which may

Here are the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images that 
show changes in sea surface height by month. The red color indicates high water levels 
and blue indicates low water levels. These data act as a proxy for marine/estuarine water

370By combining both sea surface height data and sea surface temperature data, trends with cholera rates begin to emerge.Peaks in cholera cases over the study period (solid lines) correspond with peaks in either 
sea surface height or sea surface temperature (highlighted with red and blue circles). When peaks in sea surface height (marine water intrusion and proxy for sea level rise 
scenario) coincide with peaks in sea surface temperature (proliferation of the bacteria), we 
see the greatest peaks in cholera. From this we might speculate that increases in both temperature and sea level as projected 
in climate change scenarios, would increase the burden from cholera.Source: Lobitz et al. 2000. Climate and infectious disease: Use of remote sensing for detection of Vibrio

focused attention on best management practices for treatment of water.
While trends suggest that the risk to human health due to water stress and water and foodborne disease, adequate attention and investment in sound sanitation practices and

3864Food security: De˜nitions & 
causesLet™s start off by defining some key terms related to food insecurity, and look at its causes.
Module 9: Food security & malnutrition
3875Here are some key definitions related to malnutrition Œ read.Malnutrition: De˜nitionsUndernutrition: de˜ciencies of essential vitamins & minerals (collectively referred to 
as micronutrients) 
Obesity
: over-consumption of speci˜c nutrients: another form of malnutritionHunger
: discomfort from not eating Undernutritionis an important determinant of maternal & child healthClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
3886Forms of malnutritionUnder-nutritionŒof ﬁfood energyﬂ(calories) or proteinŒof micro-nutrientsIron Švital for stamina, learning capacityVitamins (especially vitamin A)IodineMalnutrition of indulgenceŒIncreased risk of diabetes, cancer, arthritis & stigmaThe word ﬁmalnutritionﬂ is often used, rather loosely, to refer to hunger and 
undernutrition. However, many obese people are also poorly, or malnourished. 
The number of people with micronutrient deficiency greatly exceeds those with macronutrient deficiency Š perhaps by a factor of three (especially with iron deficiency). 
Virtually all people with macronutrient deficiency will also experience a degree of 

micronutrient deficiency.
Module 9: Food security & malnutrition
3897People, often the poor in a society, who suffer from diseases such as malaria, upper 
respiratory illnesses, diarrhoea, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, especially if associated with 
fever, have increased caloric demand. 
Those chronically ill from some parasitic infections are unable to absorb nutrients, even if swallowed. Those needing to perform physical labour and in challenging settings will also 
have increased caloric demand.Chronic under-nourishment often leads to or contributes to obvious poverty, and often 
physical and cognitive stunting. People who are significantly overweight are also often 

stigmatised.Characteristics & impacts 
of undernutritionUndernourished often have co-existent disease, 

including parasitesŒIncreased demand for caloriesŒCan limit nutrient absorptionBoth forms of undernourishment: ŒOften co-existŒReduce cognitive potential, height, strength,

3908Food security & right to foodFood security de˜ned as:ﬁ˙˛˙
ﬂ(FAO, 2002)The right to food is universal ŒInternational Covenant on Economic, Social & Cultural Rights (UN-OHCHR, 2008)
ŒThe related concept of food entitlement was identi˜ed by 1998 Nobel Laureate Amartya SenThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines food security as a ‚‚situation 
that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to 
sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for 
an active and healthy life.ﬂ This definition comprises four key dimensions of food supplies: 
availability, stability, access, and utilization (FAO, 2002).
 Right to adequate food is a human right, inherent in all people, to have regular, 
permanent, and unrestricted access, either directly or by means of financial purchases, to 
quantitatively and qualitatively obtain adequate and sufficient food corresponding to the 
cultural traditions of people to which the consumer belongs, and which ensures a physical and 

mental, individual and collective fulfilling and dignified life free of fear (more at FAO, 2008d). 
 Entitlement means that in a well-governed society, people do not starve because the 
food that exists is distributed sufficiently evenly to avoid famine. People may either be given 
food, vouchers, or provided with publicly funded work, which enables them to buy food.  Sen™s analysis originally focused on the famine in WWII in Bengal, which Sen 
witnessed as a child, and in which about 3 million people died. Although there had 
been poor harvests at the time, Sen showed that in the year of the maximum number of 
deaths, the harvest had improved. There are numerous other examples of national and 
regional famine which have occurred during times of adequate national or regional food 
production Œ among the best known are the Irish famine of the late 1840s and exports of 
food from India during periods of severe famine in the 19th century (see Davis, 2000), and 
appropriation of crops from occupied Vietnam by Japan, during WWII.

3918Food security & right to foodFood security de˜ned as:ﬁ˙˛˙
ﬂ(FAO, 2002)The right to food is universal ŒInternational Covenant on Economic, Social & Cultural Rights (UN-OHCHR, 2008)
ŒThe related concept of food entitlement was identi˜ed by 1998 Nobel Laureate Amartya SenSen™s work was important in challenging an opinion which until then was overly-influential 
Œ that famines were most often caused by ﬁnaturalﬂ disasters. In reality the explanation 
is often more complex. The primary cause of the great Chinese famine (1959-1962) was 
social/political, but it also had secondary environmental factors. The more recent North 
Korean famine has complex social, political, and environmental causes, including recurrent 

flooding. However, the disconnection of North Korea from the global economy, including 

the global system of food relief, has been a major factor, together with a gross national 

maldistribution.An important cause of the lack of food entitlement is that the chronically hungry lack the cognition, social connections, and political influence to organise in ways that 
are sufficiently effective to remedy their situation. More ﬁproximalﬂ causes of lack of 
entitlement include scarcity of fertile land, water, seeds, credit, and access to markets.

3929Causes of food insecuritySource: Black JL et al. (2008)This figure is a framework of the relations between poverty, food insecurity, and other 
underlying and immediate causes to maternal and child under nutrition and its short-term and 
long-term consequences. I™ll enlarge is now so we can see it in more detail.
A framework (from Black JL et al. 2008. Maternal and child under nutrition: global and regional exposures and health consequences. Lancet. 2008 Jan 19;371(9608):243-60) 
recognizes the basic and underlying causes of under nutrition, including the environmental, 
economic, and sociopolitical contextual factors, with poverty having a central role (UNICEF).There is no ﬁsingleﬂ cause of food security. Instead, there are numerous causal factors, all of 
which are inter-connected. It is more accurate to think of these factors as a system Œ a network 

of related, connected factors, rather than a hierarchical list. Nevertheless, of the many factors 
which contribute, it is still necessary to list them in order. But the order used here does not 

mean that there is necessarily quantitative evidence to show that these causes are ranked in 
priority. The following slides will provide more detail about these factors.
Lack of ﬁfood entitlementﬂ Œ inequality, appropriation, poor governance, and subsidies by 
powerful countries which distort production geography Œ discussed in some detail.The ﬁstork and plowﬂ Œ struggle between increases in population and food. This theme is 
mentioned several times, but not in detail. Note, however, that a major cause of continuing 

population growth is poverty, poor education, poor nutrition, and inequality. Thus the causes 

contribute to the consequence, leading to what some commentators call ﬁentrapmentﬂ (Ehrlich 
et al., 1995; King, 1990).
contd...Module 9: Food security & malnutrition
3939Total (growing) consumer demand combines with apparent proximity to further yield growth of 
key crops. Some scientists argue that there are apparent flattening in the yields of some crops 
Œ meaning additional land will need to be harnessed for further crop growth. Others argue that 
genetic engineering may overcome some of these limitations; however, to date, the success of 

GMO crops has not equaled hope.Under-investment in agricultural research; excessive reliance on long hoped for ﬁGene 
Revolutionﬂ Œ this overlaps a point in the previous slide.
Conflict and poverty Š this is often presented as an external factor, a surprise which 
undermines food security or poverty relief. Instead, it can be argued that poverty and periodic 

conflict are highly likely, though temporally unpredictable manifestations of under-nutrition, 

and local, regional, and global inequality. 
Diversion of human and other forms of energy to grow food crops for animal feed or vehicle fuels. This practice could become increasingly unacceptable in a food constrained world, 
unless there are major technological breakthroughs.Global environmental change: climate change, plus + (atmospheric, water, and soil factors) 
climate change models are discussed in detail; many other cautionary elements are mentioned 
as caveats.Global economic failure, rising cost of oil, fertiliser, transport, and other inputs contributed 
to the recent food price bubble. Given the long-term trajectory of these inputs is upward is 

another reason to be concerned about future global food security.

 of Disease (BoD)Source: Black JL et al. (2008)
According to Black et al., 2008, in 2005 stunting, severe wasting, and intrauterine growth 
restriction together were responsible for 2.2 million deaths and 21% of DALYs for children 

younger than 5 years. Deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc were estimated to be responsible for 0.6 million and 0.4 million deaths, respectively, and a combined 9% of global childhood DALYs. 
Suboptimum breastfeeding was estimated to be responsible for 1.4 million child deaths and 44 million DALYs (10% of DALYs in children younger than 5 years). 
In an analysis that accounted for co-exposure of these nutrition-related factors, they were 
together responsible for about 35% of child deaths and 11% of the total global disease

40016MaizeWheatRiceGrains: Global price trends2003-2008Price bubbleSource: Von Braun (2008)tdbliAccording to von Braun (2008): The price of nearly every agricultural commodity sharply increased in the past two years, creating a global food price bubble. At their peaks in the 
second quarter of 2008, world prices of wheat and maize were three times higher than 
at the beginning of 2003, whereas the price of rice was five times higher (Figure). Dairy 

products, meat, palm oil, and cassava also experienced sharp price hikes. The prices of 
butter and milk, for example, tripled between 2003 and 2008, and the prices of beef and 
poultry doubled. Food inflation has put upward pressure on general inflation around the 

globe. In 2007Œ2008, average food inflation has been higher than average overall inflation 
in 27 of the 31 countries with a high proportion or number of undernourished people. (Source: International Food Policy Research Institute. 2008. Title?)
More recently, the price of food and other commodities have declined by about 30 to 40% 

as a result of the economic slowdown and favorable weather conditions, but they remain 
high compared with three years ago. This short-term price relief is insufficient, however, to 

ensure that the poor have access to adequate amounts of nutritious food.For 2009, FAO estimates that despite the decline of international cereal prices, food prices 
remain at high levels in developing countries and in several continue to increase, affecting 
the food security of large numbers of vulnerable populations.Source: Von Braun 2008. ‚High Food Prices: The What, Who and How of Proposed Policy Actions™,

40117Since the AR4, international food prices have reversed historical downward trend. The plot shows the history of FAO food and cereal price indices (composite measures of food 

prices), with vertical lines indicating events when a top five producer of a crop had yields 
25% below trend line (indicative of a seasonal climate extreme). Australia is included 
despite not being a top five producer, because it is an important exporter and the drops 

were 40% or more below trend line. Prices may have become more sensitive to weather-

related supply shortfalls in recent years. At the same time, food prices are increasingly 
associated with the price of crude oil (blue line), making attribution of price changes to 
climate difficult. Thus, there is clear evidence since AR4 that prices can rise rapidly, but the 

role of weather in these increases remains unclear. All indices are expressed as percentage 

of 2002Œ2004 averages. Source: Food price and crop yield data from FAO (http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex and

40521Record high daytime and nighttime temperatures over most of the summer growing season reduced leaf and grain-filling development of key crops such as maize, fruit trees, and 
vineyards; accelerated crop ripening and maturity by 10 to 20 days; caused livestock to 
be stressed; and resulted in reduced soil moisture and increased water consumption in 
agriculture. Italy experienced a record drop in maize yields of 36% from a year earlier, whereas in

wheat harvests, which had nearly reached maturity by the time the heat set in, declined by

Livestock production also contributes to climate change by reducing the capacity of existing carbon sinks as native habitat is converted for pasture/feed uses.In addition, excess meat consumption also harms human health (e.g., heart disease, 
cancer, obesity). Consequently, a ﬁcontract and convergeﬂ policy to stabilise global meat 

consumption at 90 gm per capita per day has been called for (Gerber, P., Wassenaar, T.,

capita per day, the land required for feed production would be about 2.5 billion hectares 


The increasing demand for meat consumption is paralleled by an increase in soy bean production that is mainly used as animal feed. An expansion of agricultural land used for 
soybean production could reduce the land reserved for staple food production.Sources: Naylor R 2005. Losing the Links Between Livestock and Land;

41127A consistent conclusion running through the climate change food modelling literature is that already vulnerable populations will be among those most harmed.Source: Fischer G et al. 2005. Socio-economic and climate change impacts on agriculture: an integrated

41329This 2001 model shows rain-fed potential cereal production by 2080. It assumes one crop per year with a high level of inputs on land currently under cultivation, and shows 
a net decrease of some 100 million tons at the global level. However, again, the greatest 

decrease is in developing countries, especially India and sub-Saharan Africa.
Method for figure: Climate change impacts by grid cell are visualized using a normalized difference index. They are calculated by dividing the difference in cereal production 
capacity between future and current production potential by their sum. The index ranges 
from a value of Œ100 to +100; the former indicates complete loss of production, the latter 
occurs in areas where cereal production is not possible under current climate conditions 
but would be feasible with climate change.Model: ECHAM4 (Max Planck Institute of Meteorology).Source: Fischer, G., M. Shah, H.V. Velthuizen, and F.O. Nachtergaele. 2001. Global Agro-ecological

ŒŒ
ŒŒModels of climate change and food production include: 1. Pathways of greenhouse gas emissions (depending on different scenarios, 
described in the IPCC, such as the SRES scenarios).2. Climate ﬁsensitivityﬂ to CO2 equivalent levels: any given future CO2 equivalent 
level will have different effects on temperature and rainfall.3. Strength of carbon fertilisation effect: CO2 has been considered as having a 
natural ﬁfertilisingﬂ effect, as CO2 is vital for photosynthesis.4. Incorporation of food trade. Global food security also depends on how food 
is traded; this trading system can greatly compensate the under-production of 
food in any region. Most of the maps available today show food productivity in 
different regions, under different climate change scenarios; some, but not all, 
specifically mention that food trade is incorporated into the models. Module 9: Food security & malnutrition
41531Climate change will also modify future global fish production. However, models 
incorporating climate change as a factor affecting global fish production were not 
identified. Limits to global fish production include falling per capita global wild fish catch 
and limits to aquaculture. In addition, global fish production is also at risk from ocean acidification, overfishing, 
and other ecosystemic damage. Fish is a major source of protein and valuable fatty acids, 

and is especially important for many poor coastal populations. Recent modelling on the 
production from fisheries in the tropical Pacific shows that climate change will facilitate live 

coral cover (a), seaweed cover (b), total mangrove area (c), and seagrass area (d), which in 
turn results in marked decrease in the total catches of from coastal fisheries (e) and catches 
in pelagic fish catch (f).Source: Bell et al. 2013. Mixed responses of tropical Pacific fisheries and aquaculture to climate change.

crop and pasture yields compared to the summary points from AR4. Sight warming will 
decrease yields in low-latitude regions. Extreme climate and weather events will, with 

high confidence, reduce food production. The benefits of adaptation vary with crops and 
across regions and temperature changes; however, on average, they provide approximately 

a 10% yield benefit when compared with yields when no adaptation is used (WGII AR4

worse.Here are some of the things that can be done to improve future food security. CLICK to 
animate the first three improvement steps. The world should hope and work for fairer entitlement, which will also lower global population growth. It should work and hope for technological breakthroughs, but these 
will not, on their own, be enough. In particular, there should not be excessive reliance 

on a ﬁgene revolutionﬂ Œ much more can be done with conventional plant breeding, and 

investing more in research for sustainable agriculture.Module 9: Food security & malnutrition
42541Further things that can be done to improve future food security include–. (CLICK to 
animate the last two improvement steps) Population growth at the medium projection (of 9.2 billion by 2050) is not ﬁfixed,ﬂ and 
can be lowered by increased academic and political leadership, and by more investment 
in education and in family planning. 
Also not ﬁfixedﬂ is an increased global consumption of livestock Œ if global meat consumption by the poor converges toward 90 gramms per day, while it contracts among 

the over-fed toward a similar level, then the climate footprint of the global livestock 

industry need not increase. There is a need to account for likely impacts of climate change in food production models to avoid overly optimistic projections that are integrated into large-scale planning efforts.

Here are the key messages we™ll cover in Module 10. In summary, air quality, climate, and 
health intersect in many ways. CLICK to see each key message and sub message.Fuel combustion is responsible for most of the air pollutants that adversely affect human 
health. This fuel combustion is also responsible for most of anthropogenic climate change. 
Therefore, human health and climate change are inextricably linked at the concentrations 
of emissions of air pollution. The interactions are complex in that there are benefits to 
health to the energy generated by much fossil fuel combustion, such as through energy 
used to produce safe water and improved sanitation, refrigeration, and other technologies 
that continue to improve human health and well-being, At the same time, air pollutants 

are known to cause a variety of adverse health impacts, as will be discussed in this module. 
The module on mitigation will provide a more in-depth discussion of how reducing 

greenhouse gas emissions can benefit human health.Climate variability can influence air quality in a variety of ways. For example, horizontal 
and vertical air motions in the atmosphere transport and dilute air pollutants emitted 
by human activities. Temperature, humidity, rainfall, and winds also may influence the 

generation of some unwanted air contaminants, including smoke from wildfires and 
allergenic pollens.Module 10: Air quality4353Here™s how we™ll break down Module 10:1.  Introduction to air pollutants and their characteristics

4364So let™s start with an introduction to air pollution, and their characteristics.Introduction to 
air pollutants & their 

characteristics
Module 10: Air quality4375These six pollutants have been the focus of most air quality regulations at the national level. In the US, they are called ﬁcriteria pollutants.ﬂ Aside from lead, which historically 
was a petroleum fuel additive, these pollutants tend to occur wherever fuel combustion 
takes place. In urban areas, concentrations in the air often reach unhealthy levels In the 
developed world, emissions controls and other technological innovations have reduced 
CO, NO
2, Pb, and SO2 concentrations markedly since the 1960s. However, some of these 
pollutants remain serious challenges in many developing world cities. Ozone and PM 
remain serious concerns in developing and developed countries. We will consider these 

two pollutants in greater detail.There is strong evidence for causal relationships between these pollutants and morbidity and premature death.The two most important pollutants from the perspective of climate change and health are ozone and particulate matter.
We™ll now go through each of these six pollutants one by one.

PM2.5 through atmospheric reactionsAssociated with reversible declines in lung 

function of people with asthma, & exacerbates respiratory symptoms in 
sensitive individuals
Module 10: Air quality441Particulate matter is a term that refers to any solid or liquid material suspended as small 
particles in air. The numerical subscripts (2.5 or 10) refer to the upper size limit for a 

particular category of particulate matter. For example, PM2.5 includes all suspended particles 

that are smaller than 2.5 micrometers (one millionth of a meter) in aerodynamic diameter. 

The concept of aerodynamic diameter adjusts for the effects that particle density and shape 

have on the motion of particles in air. For a spherical water droplet, physical diameter 

equals aerodynamic diameter. These size matter in terms of health impacts because they are 

respirable and can stay in the lungs; smaller particles typically are breathed in and out, and 

larger particles are typically removed before reaching deep lung tissue.Particles can be directly emitted (primary) or can form through reactions in the atmosphere 
(secondary). Major physical processes of primary production include combustion of fuels and 

other organic matter, and mechanical processes like wind and friction.
Because PM can include any suspended solid or liquid material, the physical and chemical 
properties vary tremendously.
Based largely on epidemiology studies, PM exposures have been linked to a wide range of 
human health effects, including premature deaths.Some secondary particles, such as sulfates, may form more rapidly at higher temperatures.Particles have complex impacts on the global radiation balance, with some having positive 

radioactive forcing (e.g., black carbon), and others having negative radioactive forcing (e.g., 

sulfates).9Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10)
Can be primary or secondary
ŒProduced by combustion, atmospheric reactions & mechanical processes

442Ozone or O3 is a gas comprised of three oxygen atoms. Tropospheric or ﬁground levelﬂ 
ozone is a secondary pollutant, meaning that it is not directly emitted but rather forms via reactions in the atmosphere involving primary pollutants (nitrogen oxides and volatile 
organic compounds) and sunlight. Ozone mainly occurs in warm, sunny periods, with the 
rate of formation temperature dependent.Ozone is a strong oxidant that, upon inhalations, reacts with and damages the epithelial cells lining the respiratory system, from the nose to the deepest parts of the lung where 
oxygen is absorbed. Cells in the deep lung are most vulnerable because they are not 
protected by a mucus layer.
Ozone also is an important greenhouse pollutant that absorbs energy in the infrared spectrum.Not counting methane, biological sources emit an estimated 1150 teragrams of carbon per year in the form of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The majority of VOCs are 
produced by plants, the main compound being isoprene. The remainder are produced by 
animals, microbes, and fungi, such as molds.The strong odor emitted by many plants consists of green leaf volatiles, a subset of VOCs. Emissions are affected by a variety of factors, such as temperature, which determines rates 
of volatilization and growth, and sunlight, which determines rates of biosynthesis. A major 
class of VOCs is terpenes, such as myrcene.contd...10Ozone

function decrease, asthma attacks & premature death
Module 10: Air quality443Industrial use of fossil fuels produces VOCs either directly as products (e.g., gasoline) or 
indirectly as byproducts (e.g., automobile exhaust). Another major source of man-made 

VOCs are coatings, especially paints and protective coatings. Approximately 12 billion 
litres of paints are produced annually. Chlorofluorocarbons, which are banned or highly 

regulated, were widely used cleaning products and refrigerants. Tetrachloroethene is used 

widely in dry cleaning and by industry.

444This slide shows a schematic description of ground-level (tropospheric) ozone formation in urban areas. Precursor gases emitted, mainly by fossil fuel combustion and evaporative 
emissions, react in the presence of sunlight to form ozone. Because these reactions take 
some time to play out, high ozone levels are often observed down-wind of the urban 
source areas, over broad regions.Source: Queensland Government Environmental Protection Agency, 2013. https://www.qld.gov.au/

global climate change, as warmer temperatures resulted in decreased soil moisture and 
greater tendency for natural fires. Also, man-made fires may be harder to control as soil 
moisture decreases.Source: Gillett et al. Detecting the effect of climate change on Canadian forest fires. 2004. Geophysical

much as 6 ug/m3. A few regions will likely see decreases. There is a global mean increase of 0.28 µg/m3. The increase is 0.48 µg/m3 when weighted by population, greater than the global average, indicating a greater increase over more populated areas. Among all PM2.5 
components, the largest increases are in sulfate, smaller dust particles, and organic matter.
In the northern hemisphere, surface PM2.5 increases substantially near source regions (e.g., over East Asia, eastern United States, northern India, and Africa). These source 

regions are usually highly populated, therefore increases in PM2.5 are likely to adversely 
impact human health. With climate change, surface PM2.5 concentrations decrease 

over western Brazil, parts of northern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of North Africa, 
suggesting a potential ﬁclimate benefitﬂ for air quality there.Source: Fang et al. Impacts of 21st century climate change on global air pollution-related premature mortality.

470This study simulated the co-benefits of global greenhouse gas reductions on air quality and 
human health using a global atmospheric model and consistent future emission scenarios, 
via two mechanisms: reducing co-emitted air pollutants, and slowing climate change and 

its effect on air quality. They used relationships between chronic mortality and exposure 

to fine particulate matter and ozone, global modeling methods, and new future scenarios. 
Relative to a reference scenario, global GHG mitigation avoids 0.5±0.2, 1.3±0.5 and 
2.2±0.8 million premature deaths in 2030, 2050, and 2100. Air quality and health co-

benefits, especially as they are mainly local and near-term, provide strong additional 

motivation for transitioning to a low-carbon future.

472Here™s the key learnings we covered in Module 10, around the many intersections of air quality, climate, and health. 
Fuel combustion is responsible for most of the air pollutants that adversely affect human 
health. This fuel combustion is also responsible for most of anthropogenic climate change. 
Therefore, human health and climate change are inextricably linked at the concentrations 
of emissions of air pollution. The interactions are complex in that there are benefits to 
health to the energy generated by much fossil fuel combustion, such as through energy 
used to produce safe water and improved sanitation, refrigeration, and other technologies 
that continue to improve human health and well-being, At the same time, air pollutants 

are known to cause a variety of adverse health impacts, as will be discussed in this module. 
The module on mitigation will provide a more in-depth discussion of how reducing 

greenhouse gas emissions can benefit human health.Climate variability can influence air quality in a variety of ways. For example, horizontal 
and vertical air motions in the atmosphere transport and dilute air pollutants emitted 
by human activities. Temperature, humidity, rainfall, and winds also may influence the 

generation of some unwanted air contaminants, including smoke from wildfires and 
allergenic pollens.Q: Are there any questions on the learnings from Module 11?39Learning from Module 10˝

Smith (2008)University of California, BerkeleyThe key message shown here is the health impacts of climate change will be inequitably distributed within and between countries. Given this message, it is thus important to 
improve our understanding of communities™ differential levels of vulnerability, in order to 

prioritise limited resources. Unless we have this understanding of different types and levels 
of vulnerability, then it is virtually impossible to design responses that meet the needs of 

communities. Source: Smith, K. (2008).Mitigating, adapting and suffering. How much of each? Annual Review of Public

Module 11: Assessing health vulnerability4793Key messages around assessing health vulnerability to climate change that we™ll cover are: 
(CLICK to animate four points)1. Vulnerability is the propensity to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses 
a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm 
and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. 2. The causes of vulnerability fall across a spectrum, ranging from biological 
characteristics of organisms to the terms of international trade.3. Framing vulnerability in this way is not to suggest the phenomenon is too big and 
wide to grasp. To the contrary, the many facets of vulnerability mean there is a 

correspondingly wide range of opportunities for intervention at the various levels.4. And finally, an important point: many of the causes of vulnerability to climate 
change make individuals and populations susceptible to other environmental 
threats as well. As a result, intervention to reduce vulnerability to climate change 
will bring other benefits, and these will very likely be evident before the full 
impact of climate change is apparent.(Note that these four ‚key messages™ were taken from the conclusion slide at the end of the 
draft module. I™m not sure if they are the key messages drafted at the first meeting re the 

training. They can be shifted to the end and the slide title changed to ‚Summary™ if it was

482This diagram is from the latest IPCC report (AR5). In it, we can see that risk is at the centre of the framework, and arises from the combination of vulnerability, exposure and hazards. 

The pressures indicated on the left and the right of the diagram influence these factors. 
Climate (natural variability and anthropogenic climate change) is of course one of the 
key determinants of hazards, and influences exposure and vulnerability. Socioeconomic 

processes on the right include socioeconomic pathways (e.g. development trajectories), 

action taken on adaptation and mitigation, and governance (e.g. types of decision-making 

that is occurring to respond to climate change, such as regulation of GHG emissions 
through a carbon tax); these strongly influence vulnerability and hazard. Future risks that 

individuals and communities face arise from the interactions of exposure, vulnerability and 
hazards, and are influenced by climate and development. This in turn determines the level 
of impacts from changes in the climate. This diagram highlights that we need to look at the 
system as a whole to understand risks and impacts. Although we can assess (e.g.) mitigation 

actions and exposure to weather events separately, it is the combination of all of these 

components shown in the diagram that gives us a holistic picture of the overall risks. Source: IPCC. 2013. 5th Assessment Report.
IMPACTSEMISSIONS& Land-use ChangeSource: IPCC (2013) 6Module 11: Assessing health vulnerability483In terms of understanding how exactly climate change affects health, and increases vulnerability, it is helpful to look at this diagram, which we saw in an earlier module 

(Module 2 Œ Pop. Health and Climate). 
This diagram from the IPCC AR5 report shows three primary exposure pathways by which climate change affects health:directly through weather variables such as heat and storms;indirectly through changes in natural systems that in turn affect disease vectors; 
andpathways heavily mediated through human systems such as undernutrition. The green box indicates the moderating influences of local environmental conditions on 
how climate change exposure pathways occur in a particular population. The grey box indicates that the extent to which the three categories of exposure translate to actual health burden is moderated by such factors as background public health systems 
and socioeconomic conditions, and adaptation measures. The green arrows at the bottom indicate that there may be feedback mechanisms, positive or negative, between societal infrastructure, public health, and adaptation measures and 
climate change itself.

484This is an example of a vulnerability or risk map and was developed by Germanwatch  
(a German NGO). This index is a way to analyse the quantified impacts of extreme 
weather events Š Meteorological events such as tropical storms, winter storms, severe 
weather, hail, tornado, local storms; hydrological events such as storm surges, river floods, 

flash floods, mass movement (landslide); climatological events such as freeze, wildland 
fires, droughts) both in terms of fatalities as well as economic losses that occurredŠbased 
on data from the Munich Re NatCatSERVICE, which is worldwide one of the most reliable 
and complete data bases on this matter. 
 CLICK - We can see that 6 of the top ten countries most affected by extreme weather 
events are in the Asia Pacific region. These countries ranking the highest are the ones most 
impacted and should see the Climate Risk Index as a warning sign that they are at risk from 
extreme weather events. The Climate Risk Index does not provide an all-encompassing analysis of the risks from 
anthropogenic climate change, but should be seen as one analysis informing countries™

hence will be exposed to any increase in the intensity of tropical storms, as may occur with 
climate change. There are other physical attributes of these islands that make them vulnerable Œ at particular risk are the densely populated, low lying coral atolls.The next slide includes a list of the Pacific islands, ranked in terms of their vulnerability to 
sea level rise. The major discriminator is island type Œ however, national GDP is included 

also as a measure of the islands™ capacity to respond to the threat and to adapt.11Climate change & Paci˜c Ocean sea level riseSea level rise 28

488This table shows vulnerability of Pacific island to sea level rise in categories (extreme, 
severe, moderate etc.). Note these labels apply to all islands based on the previous filled in 
value in the table. The low lying coral atolls, especially Tokelau, the Marshalls, and Tuvalu, have the greatest 
susceptibility to sea level rise. None of these islands are wealthy, as measured by GDP per 

capita. There are important cultural sources of resilience Œ traditional methods of weather 
forecasting, for example, and food storage, have helped many generations to cope with 

tropical storms. But without significant economic resources, these countries will find it 
difficult to make the structural adaptations that are required in the face of long-term 

climate change.This is an important point Œ the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be experienced by those populations with the least resources. Poverty is a powerful driver of 

vulnerability.
However, poverty is not the only cause of vulnerability, and sometimes populations that 
are poor are very good at coping with climate extremes.Source: Woodward, A.J., S. Hales, and P. Weinstein. 1998. Climate change and human

over the last 70 years. The impact of these storms was greatest in the period 1941 to 1960, and since then has declined steeply. The recent improvement has been most marked for typhoons of 

intermediate severity (not surprising since this is where adaptive strategies are likely to 
make the greatest difference). Possible explanations include better land management, 

coastal protection, communications, and early warning systems and housing.

490In terms of the weather events we™ve touched on, it is useful to understand a little bit about climate patterns, such as El Nino.First, a brief explanation of what is meant by an ‚El Niño event™.

These events are part of a cyclical climate pattern known as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, in which there are periodic shifts in ocean currents and prevailing winds, 
centered in the western Pacific. The El Niño part of this cycle involves weakening 

easterlies, warming of the Pacific on the western side, and a tendency for rainfall patterns 

to shift eastwards. This map shows how El Niño events typically bring warmer and drier conditions to much of South-East Asia, including the Indian sub-continent.

approaches to 

assessing

Module 11: Assessing health vulnerability493This particular example showcases the current WHO guidance on developing a Health National Adaptation Plan (or HNAP). This ‚WHO guidance to protect health from climate 

change through health adaptation planning™ was published in 2014 and can be found 
online at the web address listed:http://www.who.int/globalchange/publications/guidance-health-adaptation-planning/en/

Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, all countries are 
conducting National Adaptation Plans (NAPs). Guidance on conducting NAPs was developed by the Least Developed Country Expert Group (LEG) << http://unfccc.int/adaptation/groups_committees/ldc_expert_group/

items/4727.php>>. WHO developed guidance for Ministries of Health to develop the 
health components of the NAPs. The guidance is designed to fit within the national health 
process.Source: WHO. 2014. WHO guidance to protect health from climate change through health adaptation

at the HNAP and HIA as a comprehensive way to assess your country™s vulnerability to health impacts from 

climate change Œ these will be key tools for you to take away in your ongoing work to reduce vulnerability.
But within the space of this session, I™m going to give you some time Œ about 4 minutes Œ to do a very initial and informal assessment of roughly how your country is performing in each of these 10 areas that contribute 
to climate resilience. In your slide notes, please take your pen and draw a line across each section of this pie at the level Œ out of 10 Œ that you think your country is performing at. For example, if your country generally has good financing 

available for programmes targeting climate change and the health impacts of climate change, you might draw 
a line like this, towards the outer edge of the pie section Œ CLICK to show curved line. The closer to the 
outside of the pie your lines are, the more resilient you think your country is in this particular area. If sections 
have lines closer to the inside of the circle, this would be an area you think your country is much less climate 
resilient in. So over the next 4 minutes consider each pie section and draw a line somewhere across each section, with 0 Œ not resilient - on the inner ring and 10 Œ very resilient - on the outer ring.

From the perspective of vulnerability, indicators should be identified for monitoring 
changes in risk and protective factors. From the perspective of the level of adaptation 

before the HNAP was conducted, indicators should be identified for monitoring changes 
in the effectiveness of existing response measures and in the community/national capacity 
to prepare for, respond to, cope with, and recover from the health risks of climate change. 

These four factors are mediators of the extent to which exposure to the hazards of climate 
change are translated into health impacts.Let™s look next at a Health Impact Assessment and what that would be made up of.

25What we covered in Module 11Main causes of vulnerabilityHNAP & HIA assessment of vulnerabilityKey terms around health vulnerabilityModule 11: Assessing health vulnerability503One of the key take aways from this module is that the health impacts of climate change will be inequitably distributed within and between countries. Given this message, it is 
important to improve our understanding of communities™ differential levels of vulnerability, 

in order to prioritise limited resources. Unless we have this understanding of different types 

and levels of vulnerability, then it is virtually impossible to design responses that meet the 

needs of communities. Source: Smith, K. (2008).Mitigating, adapting and suffering. How much of each? Annual Review of Public

504Key learnings around assessing health vulnerability to climate change are: (CLICK to 
animate four points)1. Vulnerability is the propensity to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses 
a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm 
and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. 2. The causes of vulnerability fall across a spectrum, ranging from biological 
characteristics of organisms to the terms of international trade.3. Framing vulnerability in this way is not to suggest the phenomenon is too big and 
wide to grasp. To the contrary, the many facets of vulnerability mean there is a 

correspondingly wide range of opportunities for intervention at the various levels.4. And finally, an important point: many of the causes of vulnerability to climate 
change make individuals and populations susceptible to other environmental 
threats as well. As a result, intervention to reduce vulnerability to climate change 
will bring other benefits, and these will very likely be evident before the full 
impact of climate change is apparent.27Vulnerability is the propensity to be adversely a˜ected

characteristics, the physical environment, social 
circumstances & national & international

Module 12: AdaptationClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
5102Key messages in Module 12Strong health systems are essential for adaptationImportance of developing climate-resilient health systemsThere are two key messages in this module:The first is that strong health systems are essential for adaptation. Indeed, strong health systems are essential for most effective responses, whether that is in relation to an 
infectious diseases outbreak, such as what we saw in 2014 with Ebola, or whether that 
is in relation to provision of effective health services to respond to a natural event like an 
earthquake or tornado. Here, again we can see the utility of the ‚win-win™ argument Œ i.e. 

if we invest in health systems, then this is effectively investing in a whole range of health-
relevant responses, including risks from climate change. This links in with the second key message here Œ the importance of developing climate-
resilient health systems. These are health systems that can bounce back, and perhaps 
even transform, after a weather event such as a storm or flood. In the long-run, supporting 

climate-resilient health systems that can respond effectively to such threats, is a sustainable 

approach, as they save both money, time and lives.
Module 12: Adaptation5113This module on adaptation has three key areas:1. The theory and practice of adaptation
2. The process of conducting an adaptation assessment

3. Examples of adaptation activities in the WP and SEA region.

5124Let™s begin by looking at the theory and practice of adaptation to climate changeTheory & practice of adaptationModule 12: Adaptation5135As discussed in an earlier module, adaptation includes the strategies, policies, and measures undertaken now and in the future in all sectors to reduce potential adverse 
effects of climate change. These strategies, policies, and measures can address the risks 
of climate change directly (i.e., developing early warning systems) or indirectly (i.e., 
improving the public health infrastructure). A primary goal of building adaptive capacity is to avoid, prepare for, and effectively 
respond to the health risks of climate change. Adaptation actions will be taken at all levels, 
including our individual actions as well as programmes and activities implemented by 
the corporate sector, national agencies and institutions. These actions can be proactive, 

anticipating adverse health outcomes, or in response to observed climate change.AdaptationDe˜nition:Actions taken by individuals, institutions, 
corporate sector & governments to address the risks of climate change

Adaptation can be:ŒAnticipatoryŒResponsiveClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
514The process of adaptation can be incremental or transformational.Adaptation measures can modify current programmes, such as changing the location and/or intensity of vector control programmes to prepare for projected changes in the 
geographic range or incidence of vector-borne diseases. Or, adaptation measures can be 

designed to address new risks, such as those due to glacier lake overflows.AdaptationThe process of adaptation can be:

measures are listed as well as the source of data.10Module 12: Adaptation519The next two slides are familiar diagrams from earlier modules, but important to reacquaint ourselves with.In terms of understanding how exactly climate change affects health, and increases vulnerability, it is 
helpful to look at this diagram, which we saw in Module 2 Œ Pop. Health and Climate). 
This diagram from the IPCC AR5 report shows three primary exposure pathways by which climate change affects health:directly through weather variables such as heat and storms;indirectly through changes in natural systems that in turn affect disease vectors; and
pathways heavily mediated through human systems such as undernutrition. The yellow box indicates the moderating influences of local environmental conditions on how 
climate change exposure pathways occur in a particular population. The orange box indicates that the extent to which the three categories of exposure translate to actual health burden is moderated by such factors as background public health systems and socioeconomic 
conditions, and adaptation measures. The green arrows at the bottom indicate that there may be feedback mechanisms, positive or negative, between societal infrastructure, public health, and adaptation measures and climate 
change itself. 
Source: IPCC. 2013. AR5 Chapter 1111Source: IPCC (2013)˜˚Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
520This diagram is from the latest IPCC report (AR5). In it, we can see that risk is at the centre of the framework, and arises from the combination of vulnerability, exposure and hazards. 

The pressures indicated on the left and the right of the diagram influence these factors. 
Climate (natural variability and anthropogenic climate change) is of course one of the 
key determinants of hazards, and influences exposure and vulnerability. Socioeconomic 

processes on the right include socioeconomic pathways (e.g. development trajectories), 

action taken on adaptation and mitigation, and governance (e.g. types of decision-making 

that is occurring to respond to climate change, such as regulation of GHG emissions 
through a carbon tax); these strongly influence vulnerability and hazard. Future risks that 

individuals and communities face arise from the interactions of exposure, vulnerability and 
hazards, and are influenced by climate and development. This in turn determines the level 
of impacts from changes in the climate. This diagram highlights that we need to look at the 
system as a whole to understand risks and impacts. Although we can assess (e.g.) mitigation 

actions and exposure to weather events separately, it is the combination of all of these 

components shown in the diagram that gives us a holistic picture of the overall risks. Source: IPCC. 2013. Fifth Assessment Report.
12IMPACTSEMISSIONS& Land-use ChangeSource: IPCC (2013)Module 12: Adaptation521Also, as has been mentioned before, climate change is a stress multiplier for most climate-
sensitive health outcomes. Therefore, effectively reducing the health risks of climate 
change means improving current health protection through addressing the key drivers of 
these health outcomes, within the context of other major health concerns.13Context for adaptationClimate change is one of many factors in˜uencing human 
health & social well-beingŒIn most cases, it multiplies the threats of current drivers of climate-sensitive health outcomesPublic health challenges presented by climate change need to be addressed within the context of issues such as access to clean water 
& sanitation, inadequate nutrition, & diseases 
such as HIV/AIDSPoverty is a major factorClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
522A recurring theme throughout this training has been the importance of understanding the local context when conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments. As noted on the 
slide, there are a wide range of factors that will influence the extent of risk and the options 
available for implementation. These range from political, social, economic, through to 
technological and human factors, which all determine whether adaptation activities are 
relevant and effective. Thus, we need to have a good understanding of the context we 
are working within, in order to account for differences in culture, education, knowledge 
and other factors to really design adaptation activities that are going to be effective, 
appropriate, and ‚owned™ by the community.
14Local context mattersMultiple political, 
social, economic, technological, & human factors determine 
whether adaptation strategies, policies, & measures are e˜ectiveTherefore, di˜erences

conducting an adaptation assessmentClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
524This slide was shown in an earlier module. Conducting an adaptation assessment within a risk management framework facilitates understanding that adaptation is a process; that 
options implemented will need to be evaluated as the climate changes to determine their 
effectiveness under new conditions and to determine if modifications need to be made.When considering adaptation, the process often is as important as the outcome. Adaptation will be an ongoing process, thus ensuring that the process is appropriate 
will form an important basis for future efforts. As noted on the slide, adaptation is 
an expression of values, not just an analytic exercise. Constraints and barriers to 
implementation need to be explicitly addressed. The process needs to take into 
consideration that adaptation will affect and be affected by development pathways. Taking 

a risk management approach will likely be most effective. Risk management should consider both adaptation and mitigation, as both are needed to effectively manage the immediate and longer-term risks of climate change.

526So, before beginning an adaptation assessment, it is important to understand the reasons for the assessment, including who will be the audience (e.g., national communications, 

Ministry of Health); the questions they would like addressed; the information needed 
to answer the questions; and how the final results could be most effectively presented. 
Taking the time to work through these questions will result in a more effective and efficient 

process.18First step in an assessment:What is the purpose?Who will the audience be?

Module 12: Adaptation527These are the basic steps for conducting an adaptation assessment.The scope of the assessment (in terms of geographic extent, temporal time scale, health outcomes of interest, and other factors) should be written up at the beginning of the 
process. Ideally, the scoping of the assessment will include stakeholders to make sure 

the assessment includes their key issues of concern. In any case, stakeholders should be 
involved throughout the process. As discussed previously, the team working on the assessment should evaluate the 
effectiveness of current activities to reduce the burden of climate-sensitive health 

outcomes, and to determine what additional measures would increase their effectiveness.19Steps in an adaptation

Specification of the additional measures should include the geographic area where the 
measures are to be implemented, the time period for implementation, the mechanisms for 
implementation, who should be involved, etc.204.Estimate future potential health impacts

Steps in an adaptation 
assessmentModule 12: Adaptation529Most adaptation options will be implemented to address the existing adaptation deficit (that is, address current vulnerability to climate variability). Existing prevention strategies, such as 
programmes to address food security, may need to be implemented in new regions. Particularly 

for the risks of vector-borne diseases changing their incidence or geographic range, a key 

adaptation may be to reinstitute effective programmes that have been neglected or abandoned. 
Because of the uncertainties around future projections, whatever options are implemented 
should be robust to whatever changes occur. New risks also will arise, such as when outbreaks 

of infectious diseases appear in places where they are unexpected, or through new pathways. 
Improving the public health infrastructure is needed in many areas to increase the capacity to 
effectively prepare for and respond to current and new risks.21Public health adaptation to climate changeExisting risks

532No matter what process you™re using to conduct an assessment, these are questions that 
can be helpful for identifying adaptation policies and measures. Adaptation to what Œ is adaptation required to address the risk of flooding, the spread of 
vector-borne disease, etc.? The policies and measures implemented must be specific to the 

weather/climate hazard, the health outcome of concern, and the local context. When determining whether additional interventions are needed, it is valuable to determine the effectiveness of current interventions before improving current programmes 
or implementing new ones. Are there additional interventions that could reduce the 
current burdens of climate-sensitive health outcomes? Would a heat event early warning 

system be useful? Additional surveillance? Etc.What are the future projections for the health risks of climate change, taking into consideration changes in not only climate but also socioeconomic conditions? Which population groups are likely to be at the highest risk? For example, aging of 
populations in developed countries is likely to increase population vulnerability to heat 
events.What scale (local to regional to national) is relevant for the adaptation options under consideration? The remaining questions are considered on the next slide.24Questions for identifying adaptation policies & measuresAdaptation to what?
What is the current burden of disease? Is additional intervention needed?What are the future projections for the 
climate-sensitive health outcome? Who is vulnerable?On scale relevant for adaptation?
Module 12: Adaptation533Who will undertake the adaptations Œ individuals, communities, nations? Will the 
adaptation be reactive to climate change or proactive? How can the process be facilitated?When should the interventions be implemented? For example, there is concern about 
malaria spreading to highland areas of Africa. Surveillance systems should be established 
at the edges of the current distribution where changes in temperature and/or precipitation 
could provide a suitable climate for malaria vectors. Once surveillance has identified 
the presence of the vectors, then programmes to distribute treated bed nets could be 
implemented.Finally, the effectiveness of all interventions should be monitored and evaluated to ensure 
that public health funds are being used effectively and efficiently.

534Beginning the process of adaptation will require an understanding of what is currently being done to reduce the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes, as well as how 

effective those activities are in addressing climate variability and other factors. Discussions 
with experts involved with these activities and/or independent evaluations will provide 
insights into what else could be done now to reduce current vulnerability and the 
barriers to implementing these activities. Qualitative or quantitative consideration of 
likely future climate change can identify additional measures to increase the ability of the 
institutions, agencies, communities, and individuals to increase the range of possible future 
interventions, such as increasing the geographic extent of integrated vector management 
programmes in anticipation of disease vectors changing their range.26Adaptation baselineWhat is being done now to reduce 
the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes? How e˜ective are these policies & measures?

538To finish off this section on the adaptation assessment process, let™s just summarize the four 
steps in an adaptation assessment again: 1. Determine the scope of the assessment (in terms of geographic extent, temporal 
time scale, health outcomes of interest, and other factors).2. Ideally, the scoping of the assessment will include stakeholders to make sure the 
assessment includes their key issues of concern. In any case, stakeholders should 
be involved throughout the process. 3. The team working on the assessment should evaluate the effectiveness of current 
activities to reduce the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes, and to 

determine what additional measures would increase their effectiveness.4. Estimate the potential future health impacts, which will provide the basis for 
deciding what additional adaptation measures will be needed. 5. Identify additional adaptation measures to reduce potential negative health 
effects.Following these steps will set you up to carry out a climate change adaptation assessment 

for your country or region Œ a really valuable tool in reducing the health impacts of climate 
change.30Steps in an adaptation

540This is an example of a health and climate change adaptation project in Bhutan Œ this is a surveillance project where climate-sensitive disease data is collected at a health centre, 

which is then correlated with weather data. This photo on the right shows the manual 
weather station where weather data is collected -Œ min/max temps, humidity and rainfall.On the left is a local health worker in Bhutan collecting rainfall information.32Surveillance system in Bhutan:Collecting weather dataModule 12: Adaptation541The photo shows the form for collecting climate-sensitive disease data for the Bhutanese 
surveillance system. The columns from left to right are number; age; gender; which service 
they attended; date; type of disease (diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection, malaria, 
dengue, Japanese encephalitis, kala azar). This information is passed to central health 
officials who collate and analyse the data. The project is conducting climate sensitivity 
analyses, with a focus on temporal and spatial analyses and vulnerability mapping (risk 
mapping). Eventually, the project aims to develop predictive models, issue risk warnings, 

and develop a response plan.In discussions, health care staff noted that measuring the meteorological data and collecting the health data in another form (alongside the standard health information 
system) did not add significantly to their workload. Staff also understood the potential 
to use the weather/health relationships to identify vulnerable groups to improve the 
effectiveness of the surveillance system. 33Surveillance system in Bhutan: Collecting health dataClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
542The Western Indian city of Surat in the State of Gujarat was devastated by floods in 2006. 
Approximately three-fourth of the city was inundated with severe losses to the municipal 

corporation and the economy running into billions of rupees. The death toll was officially 
estimated to be around 150 but unofficial estimates were to the tune of more than 500.The New Civil Hospital that has been constructed in Surat, pictured in the top left, unlike the old hospital, has been built some distance away from the Tapti river. This location 

helped to obviate the impact of the floods. During the floods one of the key factors that helped in the functioning of the hospital was a electric supply characterized by a backup. This ensured that emergency services 
remained operational in the critical response phase after the disaster. Three large 

underground water tanks Œ one of which is shown bottom right - ensured that there was 
adequate water supply.
The hospital administration have also put in place a number of measures to reduce the impacts of future floods. The drainage system has been enlarged to ensure greater outflow. 

The heights of medicine cabinets have been increased by about 1 metre. A number of new 

wards have also been built in such a way that they are more flood resistant. For example, 

while carrying out new construction the operation theatres, medical intensive care unit 
and the CT scan have been built on higher ground. Source: WHO. 2015. Case Study: Climate Resilient Health Facilities. A Public Tertiary Health Facility in Surat,

34New Civil Hospital, Surat, Gujarat, India jtIddiModule 12: Adaptation543Malaria transmission occurs in a large part of India. This includes the Kutch region of Gujarat in Western 
India. The high baseline of cases in this part of the world will magnify the impact of climate change on 
this critical health concern. An Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) which includes malaria has now been established across India. However surveillance doesn™t include weather or environmental parameters which can 

predict disease outbreaks in advance, and help ensure adequate response time for health system 
preparedness - an essential component of adaptation in relation to climate change and health. However a new multinational research collaboration between the University of Michigan in the United States and the National Institute of Malaria Research in India, as well as other partners, is providing a new 
and interesting adaptation response. The group™s research has shown that monitoring the sea surface temperature of the tropical South 
Atlantic sea is related to monsoon rainfall and malaria epidemics in the district of Kutch in arid north-west 

India. Sea surface temperature data can give a warning of outbreaks about four months in advance. This 
preparation time can be incredibly useful for health administrators to put in place appropriate prevention 
and curative measures which can effectively reduce the impact of the disease. The fact that sea surface temperature in the south Atlantic is a driver of malaria outbreaks in arid India despite the considerable geographical separation between the climatic parameter Œ in America - and the 
disease outcome in India, shows that countries can collaborate well in their adaptation responses.Source: WHO. 2015.Case Study: Climate Based Early Warning System. Sea Surface Temperature in the South

544With up to one third of Mongolia™s population living as nomadic herders who rely upon 
grazing livestock, small changes in the climate and ecology can have profound effects 
on the country. Already, visible impacts have included an increase of 2.14 degrees in air 

temperature, landscape changes towards desertification, arid & semi-arid lands, and an 
increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters. The main adaptation technology that Mongolia has focused on is developing is its own Disaster Warning System (DWS), with a pilot project launched in 2005 in the Dundgobi 

province. The objective of the project was to provide herders with advanced information 
and communication technologies to create an opportunity for them to be warned about 
coming risks so they can adequately prepare in advance. The system itself has two operating modes: a day-to-day mode focusing on status updates, 
and an emergency mode to provide prior warning of impending disasters. The process for 
delivering disaster warnings to the population involves Mongolian national organizations 
and institutes collaborating to formulate disaster reports and delivering these to the 
Emergency Management and Report Centre. After this, the warnings will be disseminated 
by siren towers across Ulaanbaatar, one of the areas most vulnerable to natural hazards, 

operated by the Mongolian National Broadcaster, mobile phone networks, and radio 

stations. Source: UNEP. 2014. Adaptation Technologies Mongolia, Disaster Warning Systems. http://www.unep.org/

546Here are some examples of adaptation measures to reduce the adverse health impacts of flooding. Similar lists 
can be created for other climate-sensitive health outcomes.
An adaptation assessment is likely to identify many more options for implementation than actually can be implemented. This will require prioritization of the options to identify those with the highest priority.
The priority options should address the current adaptation deficit (i.e., where there are increased burdens of climate-sensitive diseases); that is, they make sense anyway and become more urgent when considering 

climate change. In general, measures that reduce vulnerability to climate variability will generally reduce 
future risks to climate change.Policy makers always look for options that have marginal adjustments and low cost than implementing new 
and expensive programmes, unless it can be demonstrated that the benefits of a new programme will greatly 
exceed its costs.As mentioned previously, adaptation policies and measures should be robust to a range of future climates (i.e., 
low regrets).Criteria for prioritization of adaptation activities1. Benefits/effectiveness

2. The process of conducting an adaptation assessment

3. Some examples of adaptation activities in the WP and SEA region
40What we covered in Module 12Adaptation assessmentprocessAdaptation activity e.g.sin WP & SEATheory & practice of adaptationModule 12: Adaptation549The two key messages to take away as learning from this module, in addition to the steps of undertaking an adaptation assessment, are:That strong health systems are essential for adaptation. Indeed, strong health systems are essential for most effective responses, whether that is in relation to an infectious diseases 
outbreak, such as what we saw in 2014 with Ebola, or whether that is in relation to 
provision of effective health services to respond to a natural event like an earthquake or 
tornado. Here, again we can see the utility of the ‚win-win™ argument Œ i.e. if we invest 

in health systems, then this is effectively investing in a whole range of health-relevant 
responses, including risks from climate change. This links in with the second key message here (CLICK) Œ the importance of developing climate-resilient health systems. These are health systems that can bounce back, and 

perhaps even transform, after a weather event such as a storm or flood. In the long-run, 

supporting climate-resilient health systems that can respond effectively to such threats, is a 

sustainable approach, as they save both money, time and lives.

CLICK to animate each message1. Given our rapidly increasing GHG emissions, we need to focus on ways in which 
we can reduce (and in an ideal world, reverse) this trajectory. 
2. The health sector can be more involved in this conversation, particularly via the 
framing of climate change mitigation and health activities as ‚win-win™ or projects 
with co-benefits. In addition it is important for the health sector to reduce its 

emissions, by greening hospitals and other health care facilities, for example.3. It is useful to know the sort of co-benefits projects are currently occurring, to see 
to what extent we can incorporate these in our own contexts (and in particular, 

scale these up).Module 13: Mitigation & co-benefits
5553This module on mitigation and co-benefits has two key areas:
Firstly, we will look at the concept of mitigation, and provide an overview of different 
sectors™ contributions to emissions, and why it is so important to reduce our emissions.Secondly, we will discuss the co-benefits of climate change mitigation for the environment, 
and for human health. This framing of health and mitigation activities as ‚co-benefits™ (or 

‚win-win™ strategies) has arisen in the last twenty years or so, and in the last ten years the 

health sector has started to focus more research on demonstrating co-benefits. Put simply, 

co-benefits refers to when GHG emissions can be reduced in ways that also generate 

health benefits. In this section we will discuss examples of win-win/co-benefit approaches 

to climate change and health relevant to the SE Asia and Western Pacific regions, and we 

will have a chance to discuss potential trade-offs that we need to consider when designing 

mitigation activities relevant to health.Co-bene˜ts of mitigation for health & enviIntroduction to mitigationModule 13 outlineClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
5564Introduction to mitigation
Let™s start into Module 13 by looking at some of the basic concepts around mitigationModule 13: Mitigation & co-benefits
5575To begin with Œ some definitions:
Mitigation is the reduction of greenhouse gas emission sources, or the enhancement of greenhouse gas emission sinks. Examples of the reduction of GHGs would be sourcing 
electricity from renewable sources rather than from coal or oil, or switching off hospitable 
lighting in unused rooms to reduce electricity use from coal-fire powered electricity 
generators. An example of enhancing greenhouse gas emission sinks is planting forests, 
which take up carbon dioxide.CLICK - Mitigation is very relevant for the health sector Œ as mentioned earlier, reducing 
GHG emissions can be done in ways that promote and protect health.CLICK - All sectors are able to reduce their GHG emissions, whether in energy supply, 
forestry or agriculture.De˜nition of mitigationMitigation: a human intervention to reduce 
the sources or enhance the sinks of 
greenhouse gasesMitigation for 
the health sector: promoting & supporting initiatives that protect health by 
reducing GHG emissionsMitigation options exist for all emission sectors:Energy supplyIndustryWasteTransportAgricultureBuildingsForestry/forestsClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
5586Brainstorm 3 types of mitigation activities 
your 
assigned sectorcould take 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissionsGROUP EXERCISE:Assign each table one of the sectors listed on the previous slide: Energy supply, Industry, Waste, 
Transport, Agriculture, Buildings, Forestry. (double up if needed) Get a helper to hand out 

markers and blank A4 paper to the middle of the table.ﬁFor your assigned sector, please brainstorm 4 or 5 types of mitigation activities this sector 
could take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. You™ll have 
4 minutes as a group. If you have more than 4 or 5 ideas, go for it! Are there any questions? If not, ﬁOk, start brainstorming for 

this particular sector.ﬂ
Give a time warning at 2 mins 30 secs: ﬁYou have another 30 seconds to finish off your 
brainstorm. Please also decide on one representative for your group, who™ll report back your three mitigation activities.ﬂAt 3 minutes : ﬁOk, please finish your brainstorm. Could I please have the representative from 
this table tell us which sector you had, and the three activities you came up with that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from this sector?ﬂ Repeat for each table, writing up all mitigation activities on a flipchart page (or having someone Œ another trainer or a participant - you™ve asked to scribe for you write each one 

down). If an activity is repeated by another group, tick the activity where it was first written, to 
show that many activities are possible across a range of sectors. ﬁThank you for all your great mitigation ideas. We™ll put these up on the wall so you can go 
back to the ideas that other groups came up with. I™d encourage them to keep this wide range 
of mitigation activities in mind when you™re back in your own countries working to mitigate 

climate change. We™ll also look at mitigation options for the health sector in the next section of 

this module.ﬂModule 13: Mitigation & co-benefits
5597The main message to take from this graph is that emissions of air pollutants, including carbon dioxide and methane and other more ‚conventional™ air pollutants such as nitrogen 
dioxide are increasing, and these have negative impacts on health.
Many Š but not all Š mitigation measures reduce these air pollutants. A couple of mitigation examples include the reduction of cattle grazing (and other ruminant animals) 
Œ these animals produce methane; and the reduction of coal-fired power stations, which 
emit carbon dioxide.Source: IPCC. 2013. WGIII AR5Annual anthropogenic GHGs 1970-2010

This image from the AR5 of the IPCC shows total anthropogenic GHG emissions (GtCO2eq / yr) by economic sectors. Indirect emissions, shown on the right, are those that result from the generation of electricity and heat; direct emissions by sector are shown on the left. We can see here that the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector emits the largest 
amount of direct emissions, closely followed by industry.
The IPCC presents many suggestions for reducing GHG Œ lets take one sector Œ transport:
The IPCC notes that ﬁIntegrated urban planning, transit-oriented development, more 
compact urban form that supports bicycling and walking, can all lead to modal shifts 

as can, in the longer term, urban redevelopment and investments in new infrastructure 
such as high-speed rail systems that reduce short-haul air travel demand.ﬂ These changes 

have the potential to cut transport GHG emissions by 20% to 50% in 2050 compared to

5619This slide, and the next one, make the point that the countries primarily responsible for greenhouse emissions are not the countries that so far are most affected by climate change.This is a density-equaling cartogram with countries scaled according to cumulative 
emissions in billion tonnes carbon equivalent in 2002.The total amount of greenhouse gases emitted by a country is closely correlated with national wealth, measured in conventional terms such as total GDP. This map illustrates 

how some countries, and some regions of the world, have been very modest contributors 
to total greenhouse emissions, and this is mostly a reflection of differentials in wealth. 
(Note that these figures are not expressed per capita, so population size is also a factor. 

New Zealand, for instance, escapes notice in this cartogram, but is the fifth heaviest 
emitter in the OECD when its small population is taken into account.)Source: Patz J A, Gibbs H K, Foley J A, Rogers J V, Smith K R, 2007, ﬁClimate change and global health:

56311The main message from this graph is that recent studies show that cumulative carbon dioxide emission is a useful metric for linking emissions to impacts. We can see here that 

an increase in cumulative emissions is related to an increase in global mean temperature 
change.Background note for trainer - [Error bars reflect uncertainty in carbon cycle and climate responses to carbon dioxide emissions due to observational constraints and the range of 
model results. Cumulative carbon emissions are in teratonnes of carbon (trillion metric 
tonnes or 1 000 gigatonnes).]Source: Committee on Stabilization Targets for Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Concentrations, National

56412Relationship between CO2 & temperatureSource ŒCommittee on Stabilization Targets for Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Concentrations, National Research Council (2011)What we can see in this table is that global temperature change can be linked both to concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and to accumulated carbon emissions. The 
green numbers represent the low end of the range, and the red represents the high end 
of the range. The black bolded numbers represent the best estimate of carbon dioxide 
concentration, which is then linked to the associated global average warming.
Because there are many factors that shape climate, uncertainty in the climate sensitivity is large; the possibility of greater warming, implying additional risk, cannot be ruled out, and 

smaller warmings are also possible. Choices about stabilization targets will depend upon 
value judgments regarding the degree of acceptable risk.Source: Committee on Stabilization Targets for Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Concentrations, National

greenhouse gas emissions.Co-bene˜ts of mitigation for health & the environment Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules

Working Group II of the IPCC had its first major and serious focus on co-benefits in the 
Fifth Assessment Report.
By co-benefits we mean– (explain formula listed)

On the next slide I™ll present some examples of mitigation strategies that have health co-
benefits.Module 13: Mitigation & co-benefits
56715Here are some co-benefit examples:
Public transport Œ such as cycling rather than driving a car, results in reduction in 
carbon emissions as well as improved health.Reducing consumption of meat (ruminants that emit methane) results in fewer 
methane emissions as well as improved (mainly heart) health.Clean energy sources - such as windpower and solar power - reduce carbon 
emissions and have the benefit to health of reducing air pollution via less reliance 
on dirtier energy sources, such as coal-fired power plants.Population growth influences the consumption of resources and emissions of 

Climate-Altering Pollutants (such as methane, carbon dioxide etc.) (CAPs) (Cohen, 

2010). Slowing population growth through lowering fertility, as might be achieved 

by increasing access to family planning, has been associated with improved 

maternal and child health Œ the co-benefit - in two main ways: increased birth 

spacing and reducing births by very young and old mothers.Public transport

57119Many people in Vietnam still depend on coal, straw, leaves or wood for cooking. These 
open fires contribute to air pollution and cause lung and eye diseases owing to people 
spending time in hot and smoky kitchens. This traditional cooking method also involves 
women and children walking to find wood for daily cooking.
Solar cookers are a great outcome for emissions reduction, using the renewable source of sunlight to concentrate heat for cooking, reducing use of wood, which captures carbon, 

and also reducing diseases from air pollution. These images show solar cookers distributed by Vietnam Solar Serve, an NGO that

57220Waste management at Bir Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal20piittallA Health Care Waste Management Center was established in 2011 at Bir Hospital, 
Kathmandu. It was endorsed by the WHO with technical assistance from the Nepal Public 

Health Foundation and Health Care Without Harm. The Center is based on three pillars 

Œ waste management, injection safety, and mercury elimination. Prior to the Center™s 

development on the hospital grounds, the site was used for dumping waste.The Center has three main functions Œ i) recycling; ii) biological treatment of food/human waste and iii) safe storage of mercury. 
The waste that is able to be recycled, including plastics, paper, rubber and glass, is 
segregated and sold, while the non-recyclable infectious waste - including bandages and 
cotton Œ is treated in the autoclave for sterilisation and then placed in the vermicomposter 
(worm farm). A trolley is fitted with colour-coded buckets for risk and non-risk waste 

collection within the hospital. Approximately 80-100 kilograms of waste is collected per 
day from the hospital. The second function of the Center is a biogas plant which manages biodegradable waste, including food and human waste (e.g. from surgical operations). The plant then produces 

fertiliser (slurry) - which will eventually be sold to farmers once safety tests are completed 
- and methane and carbon dioxide, which is currently being used to run the Center™s 

kitchen and autoclaves. Future plans include the purchase of a generator for electricity to 

power the street lamps within the hospital compound. contd...Module 13: Mitigation & co-benefits
57320The third function is to safely store mercury.
Many benefits are observable from the Center™s operation, ranging from climate change 
mitigation to capacity development. The total reduction of greenhouse gases within the 
hospital as a result of the Center™s activities was estimated to be
 75.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum, equating to US$ 531. In 2012, 79% of total waste was being recycled in the hospital. The cost of setting up the Center was approximately US$ 6000 and it is 
expected that this cost will be paid back in three to four years. An additional benefit of the 
Center is that burn injury patients are trained to make handicrafts for purchase from the 
plastic waste.Waste management at Bir Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal20piittallClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules

more widely, moving away from in-situ visits to medical facilities by accessing health 

information online, which has benefits for health, but also for the environment in reducing 
travel emissions?ﬂ (PLoS Holmner & Ebi).ﬁMake a list of possible changes to public health practice that would also act as mitigation activities in the notes next to this slide in your handouts. I™ll give you 3 minutes for

57622What we covered in Module 13Co-bene˜ts of mitigation for health & enviIntroduction to mitigationSo let™s finish off Module 13 now. A reminder that in this module we™ve:
Firstly looked at the concept of mitigation, an overview of different sectors™ contributions 
to emissions, and why it is so important to reduce our emissions.Secondly, we discussed the co-benefits of climate change mitigation for the environment, 
and for human health. This framing of health and mitigation activities as ‚co-benefits™ (or 

‚win-win™ strategies) has arisen in the last twenty years or so, and in the last ten years the 

health sector has started to focus more research on demonstrating co-benefits. We looked 

at examples of win-win/co-benefit approaches to climate change and health relevant to 

the SE Asia and Western Pacific regions, and we also discussed potential trade-offs that we 

need to consider when designing mitigation activities relevant to health.Module 13: Mitigation & co-benefits
57723The three key messages to take away from this module are:CLICK to animate each message
Given our rapidly increasing GHG emissions, we need to focus on ways in which we can reduce (and in an ideal world, reverse) this trajectory. 
The health sector can be more involved in this conversation, particularly via the framing of climate change mitigation and health activities as ‚win-win™ or projects with co-benefits. In 

addition it is important for the health sector to reduce its emissions, by greening hospitals 
and other health care facilities, for example.It is useful to know the sort of co-benefits projects are currently occurring, to see to what 
extent we can incorporate these in our own contexts (and in particular, scale these up).
Climate change mitigation is vital, & the health sector has an important 
role to playThe framing of mitigation activities with relevance to health as ‚co-bene˜ts™ or ‚win-
win™ is strategic & usefulMany co-bene˜ts projects are underway, & need to be scaled up where possibleLearning from Module 13Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules

United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
The science & politics of climate change are more than 100 years old.  Historically important conferences include: 
ŒToronto Conference on The Changing Atmosphere: 
Implications for Global Security in 1988ŒUN Conference 
on Human Environment held in 1972The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted at the UN Conference 
on Environment & Developmentin Rio de Janeiro in 1992Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
588The UNFCCC sets an overall framework for intergovernmental efforts to tackle the challenges posed by climate change. It recognizes that the climate system is a shared resource whose stability can 
be affected by industrial and other emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The 
Convention enjoys near universal membership, with 192 countries having ratified. The Convention 
entered into force on 21 March 1994. The UNFCCC Secretariat, located in Bonn, supports the negotiation processes, particularly the annual Conference of Parties (COP) (meeting of all signatories to the UNFCCC), the Members of the 

Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP), and the two Subsidiary Bodies and their Bureau. 
One of the key agreements reached was the Kyoto Protocol in which most highly industrialized 
countries agreed to legally binding measures for reducing emissions. For the purpose of the Convention, ﬁAdverse effects of climate changeﬂ means changes in the 
physical environment or biota resulting from climate change that can have significant deleterious 
effects on the composition, resilience, or productivity of natural and managed ecosystems or on the 
operation of socio-economic systems or on human health and welfare.
Under the Convention, governments: Gather and share information on greenhouse gas emissions, national policies, and best practices; Launch national strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to expected risks, including the provision of financial and technological support to developing countries; andCooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change.Source: www.unfccc.int

and economic development). Health and other issues were not explicitly mentioned; their 
importance became clear with subsequent research and experience.Decision 5/CP.7 

Recognizes that the problems of poverty, land degradation, access to water and food, and 
human health remain at the centre of global attention, and that synergies and channels are 
needed to achieve sustainable development.Decides that implementation of the activities in the area of health, among others, should be supported through the Special Climate Change Fund and the Adaptation Fund, and 

other bilateral and multilateral sources. These are funds established under the Convention 
but administered by other bodies. Additional funds were established in subsequent COPs, 
particularly the Green Climate Fund.

590The Conference of the Parties (COP) is the prime authority of the UNFCC Convention. It is 
an association of all member countries (or ﬁPartiesﬂ) and usually meets annually for a period 

of two weeks. These sessions are attended by several thousand government delegates, 
observer organizations, and journalists. The COP evaluates the status of climate change and 
the effectiveness of the treaty. It examines the activities of member countries, particularly by 

reviewing national communications and emissions inventories; it considers new scientific 
findings; and it tries to capitalize on experience as efforts to address climate change proceed. A Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) counsels the COP on matters 
of climate, the environment, technology, and method. It meets twice a year. 
A Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) helps review implementation of UNFCCC and deals with financial and administrative matters. SBI meets twice each year. 
Several expert groups exist under the Convention. 
Partner agencies include the Global Environment Facility (GEF) who administers grants and 
loans to poor countries to help them address climate change, as called for by the Convention.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides services to the Convention, 
although it is not part of it, through conducting comprehensive reviews every 5 to 7 years of the 
status of climate change and climate-change science, along with special reports and technical 

papers on request.SOURCE: www.unfccc.int

measures taken by Parties and the progress made in achieving the ultimate objective of the 

Convention. COPs review the implementation of the Convention and any other legal instruments that the COP adopts and take decisions necessary to promote the effective implementation of 
the Convention, including institutional and administrative arrangements.The COP meets every year, unless the Parties decide otherwise. The first COP meeting 
was held in Berlin, Germany in March, 1995. The COP meets in Bonn, the seat of the 
secretariat, unless a Party offers to host the session. Just as the COP Presidency rotates 

among the five recognized UN regions - that is, Africa, Asia, Latin America and the 
Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe and Western Europe and Others Œ there is a 

tendency for the venue of the COP to also shift among these groups.Source: www.unfccc.int

592The CMP meets annually during the same period as the COP. Parties to the Convention 
that are not Parties to the Protocol are able to participate in the CMP as observers, but 

without the right to take decisions. The functions of the CMP relating to the Protocol are 
similar to those carried out by the COP for the Convention. The first meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol was held in Montreal, Canada in 
December 2005, in conjunction with the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties 

(COP 11). The Parties to the Kyoto Protocol also formally adopted the ﬁrulebookﬂ of the 1997 Kyoto 
Protocol, the so-called ‚Marrakesh accords™, which sets the framework for implementation 

of the Protocol.10CMPCMP˜˚˙˙˙ˇˇ˙˘Module 14: Health & the UNFCCC593The Subsidiary Body for Scientific & Technological Advice, or SBSTA, is one of two permanent subsidiary 
bodies to the Convention established by the COP/CMP. It supports the work of the COP & CMP through 

provision of timely information & advice on scientific & technological matters related to the Convention 
or its Kyoto Protocol.
Key areas of work for the SBSTA are impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change; emissions 
from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; promoting the development and 
transfer of environmentally-sound technologies; and conducting technical work to improve the guidelines 

for preparing and reviewing greenhouse gas emission inventories from Annex I Parties. The SBSTA carries 

out methodological work under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, and promotes collaboration in 

the field of research and systematic observation of the climate system. In addition, the SBSTA plays an important role as the link between the scientific information provided 
by expert sources such as the IPCC on the one hand, and the policy-oriented needs of the COP on the 

other hand. It works closely with the IPCC, sometimes requesting specific information or reports from it, 
and also collaborates with other relevant international organizations that share the common objective of 
sustainable development. The SBSTA and SBI work together on cross-cutting issues that touch on both their areas of expertise. 
These include capacity building, the vulnerability of developing countries to climate change and response 

measures, the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, and key political issues such as the 2013-2015 review, the full 

spectrum of discussions under the Technology Mechanism, and co-ordination of support for REDD plus. 
The SBSTA and the SBI have traditionally met in parallel, twice a year. When they are not meeting in 
conjunction with the COP, the subsidiary bodies usually convene at the seat of the secretariat in Bonn, 

Germany.

594The SBI is currently shifting to a new and transitional phase towards monitoring, reviewing and verifying 
(MRV) functions and demonstrating progress in implementing the Bali Action Plan. In 2013, the SBI had the challenging task of managing the shift in focus towards the MRV issues with the launch of the international assessment and review (IAR) and international consultations and analysis (ICA) 
in 2014, and work on nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs). Loss and damage and adaptation

damage mechanism and pledging funds in the range of US$ 100 million to the adaptation fund. On adaptation, finance and technology transfer, the focus was on finding the best way to manage relevant 
issues in the SBI agenda while making the best use of the increasing role of the specialized bodies and 
institutions that have been created in Cancun and Durban and operationalized in Doha (e.g. Adaptation 

Committee, Standing Committee on Finance, and the Technology Mechanism), to deal with the relevant 

issues. While the technical discussions under these traditional items are now being taken up under the 
constituted bodies, the SBI has the responsibility of maintaining the political momentum and ensuring 
transparency on these matters. The SBI works together with the SBSTA on cross-cutting issues that touch on both their areas of expertise. 
These include capacity building, the vulnerability of developing countries to climate change and response 

measures, the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, and key political issues such as the 2013-2015 review, the full 

spectrum of discussions under the Technology Mechanism, the work of the Adaptation Committee and co-

ordination of support for REDD plus. The SBSTA and the SBI have traditionally met in parallel twice a year. When they are not meeting 

in conjunction with the COP, the subsidiary bodies usually convene at the seat of the secretariat in 

Bonn.Source: www.unfccc.int
12Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI)˘†˝’˘˝Module 14: Health & the UNFCCC595The Kyoto Protocol is an international legally binding agreement under the Convention to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, 

Japan, on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. The major 

feature of the Kyoto Protocol is that it sets binding targets for 37 industrialized countries 

and the European community (Annex 1) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There are 
83 countries and ratifiers of the Kyoto Protocol. 
The Protocol™s first commitment period began in 2008 and ended in 2012; this was extended while the next agreement is negotiated. The COP in Paris in 2016 is the deadline 

for the next agreement.The Kyoto targets are an average of 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 
levels over the five-year period 2008-2012. The major distinction between the Protocol 

and the Convention is that while the Convention encourages industrialized countries to 
stabilize GHG emissions, the Protocol commits them to do so. Recognizing that developed countries are principally responsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial 
activity, the Protocol places a heavier burden on developed nations under the principle of 

ﬁcommon but differentiated responsibilities.ﬂ Source: www.unfccc.int

598The IPCC holds annual meetings (or plenaries) where the government representatives meet to take decisions relative to the work of the IPCC. To further support the work of the 

Working Groups, a Bureau meets twice a year to discuss progress on assessment reports 

and other related issues. The IPCC Secretariat supports the work of the Plenary and 
Bureau; it is based in Geneva, Switzerland in the WMO building.
Under the Plenary are a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (based in 
Japan) and, when assessment reports are being conducted, Working Groups to conduct 

the assessments. Traditionally there have been three Working Groups, one on the physical 

science basis; one on impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability; and one on mitigation. The 
number and focus of Working Groups is up to the Plenary. There are many discussions on 

possible organization of Working Groups for the next assessment report. Each Working 

Group is led by two Co-Chairs, one from a developed and one from a developing country.
A Technical Support Unit supports each Working Group. It is their job to run the 
assessment.The assessment reports are the work of the authors, contributors, and reviewers, all of whom are volunteers. Authors volunteer about 6-9 months of time during an assessment.Source: www.unfccc.int
16IPCCorganization
Module 14: Health & the UNFCCC599Governments are members of the IPCC. As such, it is up to them to request the scientific community to conduct assessments. Governmental also elect the Bureau that ensures 
assessments are conducted following the IPCC Rules and Procedures; each Working 

Group Bureau has one representative from each WMO region. Governments also discuss 
and approve outlines for assessment reports. Governments and organizations officially 
recognized by the IPCC nominate authors for each Working Group assessment report.
A Working Group Bureau approves the author teams for its Working Group. Authors are 
chosen based on their scientific expertise, and to achieve geographic and gender balance. 
The IPCC mandates that 40% of a Working Group author team be from developing 

countries.17Role of GovernmentsGovernments request the scienti˜c community to conduct comprehensive

600Other activities of governments are to participate in the review process for an assessment report and the Plenary sessions.The last step of an assessment report is for governments to approve the Summary for Policymakers. This is done in a Plenary where the SPM is discussed and approved line-by-

line. Approval is by consensus; all governments have to agree to each word in a SPM.18Role of GovernmentsGovernments participate in the review 
process & in the IPCC Plenary sessions, where main decisions about the IPCC work

Module 14: Health & the UNFCCC601A few notes on the IPCC to correct any misperceptions. The IPCC does not conduct research or monitor trends. It does conduct comprehensive assessments, providing 
statements that are policy relevant while being policy neutral. Assessment reports need to provide the full range of viewpoints in the scientific community.
Review is an essential component of the IPCC process, helping ensure objective and comprehensive assessments.Q: Have any of you participated in a Plenary or assessment report? If so, can you tell us about your experiences?19IPCC: correcting misperceptionsDoes not ˜˚˛˝˙˜ˆˇ

602The diagram I™ll show you in a minute outlines the process of an IPCC assessment. CLICK to show diagram. This starts with the approval by the Plenary of an outline for the report (point). This is called a Plenary Approved Outline and is posted on the IPCC and Working 

Group websites. It is a high level summary of what the Working Group commits each 

chapter to cover, at a minimum.
There is a formal process by which governments and organizations nominate experts to be considered as authors. In the 5th Assessment Report, approximately three times as many 
people were nominated as were selected to be authors. As noted previously, the author 

team needs to include the relevant expertise, to represent all world regions, and to be 
gender balanced to the extent possible. The Working Group Bureau then approves the 

author team, sometimes with modifications to improve expertise and balance. Each author 
team includes a few Coordinating Lead Authors who are tasked with leading the work of 
the chapter; Lead Authors who conduct assessments on particular topics in the chapter; 
and Review Editors whose job is to ensure that all review comments are adequately 
addressed.The above figure explains the entire process. For more information please visit www.ipcc.ch

UNFCCC related to 
adaptation Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
604This slide lists the adaptation mechanisms agreed under the Convention, the dates they were agreed, and how these agreements relate to the process of adaptation.All signatories to the Convention are required to submit regular National Communications. These are all available on the UNFCCC website.LDC support included National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) to identify 
their most urgent and immediate adaptation needs. The Least Developed Country Expert 
Group (LEG) provided guidance for conducting the NAPAs. COP 7 also agreed the Least 

Developed Country Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund, and the Adaptation Fund. 

Important milestones in adaptation mechanisms under the Convention were the Nairobi 
Work Programme, the Bali Action Plan, and the Cancun Adaptation Framework. The later 

included an agreement on supporting LDCs to conduct National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) 
to identify their medium-term adaptation needs. Discussions also were started in COP 16 
on the issue of Loss and Damage; this considers the issue of compensation to developing 
countries because of the impacts they are experiencing from climate change when their 
emissions contributed little to the impacts.Source: www.unfccc.int
22Adaptation mechanisms under the UNFCCCModule 14: Health & the UNFCCC605Four UNFCCC work streams, two committees and one group form the basis of the efforts

606Under the Convention, all Parties should report on the steps they are taking to implement 
the Convention (Articles 4.1 and 12). In accordance with the principle of ﬁcommon but 
differentiated responsibilitiesﬂ enshrined in the Convention, the required contents of these 
National Communications and the timetable for their submission is different for Annex I 
and non-Annex I Parties. 
Annex 1 Parties (developed countries as negotiated under the Convention) provide 
National Communications on a regular schedule. Most of the 41 Annex I Parties submitted 

their first national communication in 1994 or 1995, their second in 1997Œ1998, the third 
in 2001 Œ 2002, etc. Since 1996, Annex I Parties also submit an annual inventory of their 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the Secretariat.Each non-Annex I Party were supposed to submit its initial communication within 
three years of the entry into force of the Convention for that Party, or of the availability 

of financial resources (except for the Least Developed Countries, who did so at their 
discretion). All Parties have completed their First National Communication, most their 

Second, and some are working on their 4th.All National Communications are available on the UNFCCC website.
This slide can be used to ask participants if they have read their National Communications or if they participated in producing it.Source: www.unfccc.int
24National CommunicationsAll Parties must report on the steps they are taking or envisage undertaking to implement the Convention: National Communications 
Annex I National Communications 
from Non-Annex I Parties Module 14: Health & the UNFCCC607In implementing Article 4.9 of the Convention, the COP, in 2001, established an LDC work 
programme, that included NAPAs, to support LDCs to address the challenge of climate 

change given their particular vulnerability. The COP also established a Least Developed 

Countries Fund (LDCF) to fund the preparation and implementation of NAPAs and an LDC 

Expert Group to provide technical support and advice to the least developed countries 
(LDCs). NAPAs provide a process for the LDCs to identify priority activities that respond to their 
urgent and immediate needs with regard to adaptation to climate change - those needs for 
which further delay could increase vulnerability or lead to increased costs at a later stage. 
The rationale for NAPAs rests on the limited ability of the LDCs to adapt to the adverse 

effects of climate change. In the NAPA process, prominence is given to community-level 

input as an important source of information, recognizing that grassroots communities 
are the main stakeholders. NAPAs use existing information and no new research is 

needed. They are action-oriented, country-driven, are flexible and based on national 

circumstances. In order to effectively address urgent and immediate adaptation needs, 
NAPA documents are presented in a simple format, easily understood both by policy-level 

decision-makers and the public. contd...25National Adaptation Programmes 
of Action (NAPA)In 2001, COP established a Least Developed Country (LDC) 
work program which included NAPAs NAPAs to support LDCs to identify priority 
activities that respond to their urgent 
& immediate needs
COP also established a LDC fund to fund 
preparation & implementation of NAPAsClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
608As at November 2013, 50 countries* had completed and submitted their NAPAs to the 
secretariat. The main content of the NAPA document is a list of ranked priority adaptation 

activities/projects, as well as short profiles of each activity, designed to facilitate the 

development of project proposals for implementation of the NAPA. Priority sectors/

areas addressed in the NAPAs are agriculture and food security, water resources, coastal 

zones, and early warning and disaster management. Most LDCs are in the process of 
implementing their NAPAs. 
Once a NAPA has been submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat, the LDC Party is eligible 
to access funding under the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), which is managed 

by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), for the implementation of the NAPA. To initiate 

the process of accessing funding, an LDC Party prepares a concept note and requests the 

assistance of a GEF implementing agency (currently there are 10 of them) for submitting 
a project identification form and then a full project proposal to the LDCF. The GEF 

agency works closely with the country during each successive step of the LDCF cycle, and 
ultimately supports the country in implementing the project.25National Adaptation Programmes

Advice (SBSTA
) as a five-year programme (2005-2010) whose objective was to assist all 

Parties, particularly developing countries, including the LDCs and Small Island Developing 

States (SIDS), to: Improve their understanding and assessment of impacts, vulnerability and 
adaptation to climate change; and Make informed decisions on practical adaptation actions and measures to respond 
to climate change on a sound scientific, technical and socio-economic basis, 

taking into account current and future climate change and variability. 
The NWP is structured around 9 areas of work (listed. During the 1st phase, which ended 
in June 2008, workshops and expert meetings allowed Parties to identify gaps and needs, 

and make recommendations for possible next steps in each area of work/ Workshops 

were conducted on a range of topics, including Climate-related risks and extreme events; 

Adaptation planning and practices, Socio-economic information, and Climate modelling, 

scenarios and downscaling. 
The 2nd phase of the NWP emphasises activities dealing with economic diversification; adaptation planning and practices; and community, national and regional activities, 

including those based on education, training, and awareness-raising.

612The objectives of the NAPs are extremely relevant to the protection of human health against adverse effects of climate change. The national adaptation plan (NAP) process was established under the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF). It enables Parties to formulate and implement national adaptation plans 

(NAPs) as a means of identifying medium- and long-term adaptation needs and developing 

and implementing strategies and programmes to address those needs. It is a continuous, 
progressive and iterative process which follows a country-driven, gender-sensitive, 

participatory and fully transparent approach.29National Adaptation Plans (NAP)To reduce vulnerability to the impacts 
of climate change, by building adaptive capacity & resilienceTo facilitate the integration of climate change adaptation, in a coherent manner, into 
relevant new & existing policies, programmes & activities, in particular development planning

immediate adaptation needs.NAPs Œ National Adaptation Plans address medium and long-term national adaptation 
needs. Issues related to vulnerable groups, communities and ecosystems have been

processes. 30

614Another area under the Subsidiary Body for Implementation is the Loss and Damage work programme.Loss and damage due to climate change happens when countries fail to both mitigate and to adapt to some effects of climate change. Climate change causes loss of livelihood, 
economic loss and of course loss of health as well.Loss and damage is common in the most vulnerable communities with the least resources. 
There is the idea of developed countries compensating for the loss and damage due to climate change paying for the damage that their greenhouse gas emission has caused. During COP 18 (2012) in Doha, Countries agreed to establish an institutional mechanism on loss and damage.31Loss & Damage work programmeFailed mitigation & adaptationFor most vulnerable countries

616In this third section we™re going to look at some of the financial mechanisms available under the UNFCCC to support action on climate change in the health sector.
33Financial mechanismsModule 14: Health & the UNFCCC617The three most relevant financial mechanisms under or entrusted by the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change are:Global Environment Facility (GEF), which is made up of the:
 ŒLeast Developed Country Fund (LDCF)
 ŒSpecial Climate Change Fund (SCCF); and the
Green Climate Fund (GCF) and

618The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is a global partnership among 178 countries, 
international institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector 

to address global environmental issues while supporting national sustainable development 
initiatives. GEF is the designated financial mechanism for a number of multilateral 
environmental agreements (MEAs) or conventions, including the UNFCCC. The GEF assists 
countries in meeting their obligations under the conventions that they have signed and 
ratified. These conventions and MEAs provide guidance to the two governing bodies of the 
GEF: the GEF Council and the GEF Assembly. 
The GEF is the largest funder of projects to improve the global environment. Since 1991, GEF has provided US$8.26 billion in grants and leveraged US$33.7 billion in co-financing 

for over 2200 projects in over 165 countries. The GEF provides grants for projects related 
to the following six focal areas: biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land 

degradation, the ozone layer, and persistent organic pollutants. 
GEF projects in climate change help developing countries and economies in transition to contribute to the overall objective of the UNFCCC ﬁto achieve [...] stabilization of 
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous 
anthropogenic interference with the climate system.ﬂ As the financial mechanism of the 
UNFCCC, GEF allocates and disburses about US$250 million dollars per year in projects in 
energy efficiency, renewable energies, and sustainable transportation. It manages the Least 

Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund.

62642Lastly, we™ll look at actions around health within the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, including what™s been learnt throughout the UN process 
around climate change and health.Health action in the 
UNFCCC -lessons learned Module 14: Health & the UNFCCC62743So why has health been undervalued in the UNFCCC negotiations so far?Firstly, it may have something to do with the relative lack of engagement of the health 
sector , due to lack of understanding of the impacts of climate on health. Secondly, the health sector uses a different language compared to the economic sector or 
the climate change negotiations.Thirdly, the climate change negotiations is very market and economy-centred as opposed 
to health-centred or right-based.
Poor engagement of health sector in UNFCCC negotiationsHealth mentioned only once in 200-page draft agreement proposed at Copenhagen UNFCCC CoP
Only one of the 323 side events at COPs focussed on 
healthOne percent of global climate funds allocated to 
health projectsOf the 13 main economic models to inform climate

62844The LDCF was tasked with funding the development and implementation of NAPA. 
However due to the limited presence of the health community in NAPA processes and 

the consequent lack of technical assistance, the health sector have submitted very few 
proposals to the LDCF.
However, this is changing within the NAP (National Adaptation Plans) processes - technical 
assistance is now provided and the health sector™s capacity to benefit from financial 

support for the development of the new NAPs has increased.Health community absent from the NAPA processLack of technical assistance

Under the submissions welcome in the revision of the NWP for COP19, Australia made a submission on how health should be one of the future areas of the work of NWP and how 
the health sector should be engaged in this process.To incorporate health in NWP, we need to call for:

636The first WHO international conference on climate change and health was held in Geneva in August 2014. It was attended by 360 participants, including health and environment 
ministers of WHO member states, senior civil servants, technical experts, UN agencies, 
NGOs, chief executives from health authorities and relevant private sector entities. 
The meeting discussed: the state of climate science, particularly as it relates to health; 
the public health response to climate change; health resilience; health benefits while 
mitigating climate change; and the economics of health and climate change. Throughout 
the conference, participants discussed linking climate, sustainable development, and 
health policy.
The meeting produced a draft summary that recognized both the need to strengthen health resilience to climate change and the opportunity to make gains in public health 
through well-planned mitigation measures. The document also recognized policy gaps and 
next steps. A final outcome document was produced by the WHO Secretariat as input to 
the UN 2014 Climate Summit and the COP meeting in Peru in 2014.

events and disasters in Southeast Asia and the Pacific
Module 15: Disaster risk management6495The year 2009 was a remarkable year for the Philippines in terms of natural hazards and disasters; enormous destruction of properties and loss of lives occurred. The map shows areas affected by various weather events 
in that year. Rainfall data (in millimeters) associated with specific weather events (i.e. tropical cyclones and 

tail-end of the cold front) are shown for some of the areas affected.
Extremes experienced included:too much precipitation throughout the year; some areas received a lot of rain while other parts of the country went through dry spell and drought conditions; and abnormalities and variance in weather patterns (e.g. multiple entry of a tropical 

cyclone during an El Niño event; longer duration of tropical cyclone; deviations 
from the normal tropical cyclone path).The disaster risk management program has decreased the cost of damage and the number of casualties due 
to weather-related disasters. However, in some instances, disaster risk response was made difficult due to 

other factors (e.g. degraded ecosystem, ill-managed land use, and risk denial by people and communities). 

In general though, the resiliency and ability to recover by the people devastated by these disasters and the 
availability of community-based support systems provided the best means of coping with these catastrophic 
events.Source: Yumul et al. 2013. Abnormal weather events in 2009, increased precipitation and disastrous impacts

BangladeshThis figure highlights the mortality from floods and storms in Bangladesh, with red lines 
representing mortality from floods and blue from storms. The 1970s and 1980s were 
deadly.
After the 1970 cyclone and independence, and building on the early cyclone shelter construction that started in the late 1960s, the government, in partnership with the 
Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, established the Cyclone Preparedness Program in 

1972. Working with local communities, a system appropriate to the area was developed 

to transmit hazard warnings Š radio broadcasts complemented by flags of various colors 
hoisted for all to see. People were taught what they signified and what to do. Cyclone 

shelters began to go up in the late 1960s, and the livestock refuges in the early 1970s. 
But after 138 000 people died in the April 1991 eastern coastal zone cyclone, the 
Multipurpose Cyclone Shelter Project began to increase the number of shelters. Each 
district™s deputy commissioner chaired a disaster management committee that included 
local representatives, elected and from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The 
May 1997 cyclone, of similar magnitude, claimed 111 lives Š far fewer than the cyclone 
in 1970. Cyclone shelters have reduced cyclone risks for millions. More remains to be 
done: shelters have space for about 2.8 million people, or 7 percent of the coastal area™s 

population, but many shelters are not functional. Source: World Bank. 2010. Natural hazards, Unnatural disasters: The economics of effective prevention.

Module 15: Disaster risk management6539The map summarizes information on the sub-national areas (regions/districts/provinces) most 
vulnerable to climate change impacts in Southeast Asia. This assessment was carried out by 
overlaying climate hazard maps, sensitivity maps, and adaptive capacity maps. The study used data 
on the spatial distribution of various climate-related hazards in 530 sub-national areas of Indonesia, 

Thailand, Vietnam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. 
The climate change vulnerability index was derived from:Historical records of climate-related hazards;
Climate hazard maps for five climate-related risks: tropical cyclones, floods, landslides, 
droughts, and sea level rise;Population density as a proxy for human sensitivity to climate-hazard exposure;
The ecological sensitivity of the region using biodiversity information as a proxy variable. A 
biodiversity-rich region, measured by the percentage of protected areas, is thus considered 
here as more vulnerable than other areas to climate hazards, other things being equal; and An index of adaptive capacity as a function of socio-economic factors, technology, and 

infrastructure.For the legend, the scale used was 0-1, with 0 indicating the lowest vulnerability level and 1 

indicating the highest vulnerability level.Source: Yusuf & Francisco. 2009. Climate Change Vulnerability Mapping for Southeast Asia. http://web.idrc.ca/

Module 15: Disaster risk management65511Based on the vulnerability map shown in slide 8, the authors developed a climate change vulnerability index by averaging each of the normalized indicators of exposure (multiple 
hazard risk exposure), sensitivity (human and ecological), and adaptive capacity. To identify 

the vulnerable areas, they ranked the regions according to the index and divided the list 
into four equal parts. Those provinces/districts falling in the fourth quartile were considered 

the vulnerable areas and further classified as mildly vulnerable, moderately vulnerable, or 
highly vulnerable.In general, these results provide few surprises as they confirm commonly-held suspicions that Jakarta is the most vulnerable region in Southeast Asia, with the Mekong River Delta 
in Vietnam and Bangkok also highly vulnerable due to their exposure to sea level rise, as is 

the northern part of the Philippines due to its exposure to tropical cyclones. Central Jakarta 
ranks first in the overall vulnerability assessment even though it has the highest adaptive 
capacity index because this district is the intersection of all the climate-related hazards, 

except tropical cyclones. It is frequently exposed to regular flooding but most importantly, 

it is highly sensitive because it is among the most densely-populated regions in Southeast 
Asia. Areas in western Java are also highly vulnerable due to exposure to multiple hazards 
(namely, floods and landslides) as well as having high population densities.

Module 15: Disaster risk management65713As noted in the module on disasters, a key reason for the increase in vulnerability to disasters is there are more people living in harms™ way. One driver is urbanization. These 

four maps show the significant change in urbanization in Jakarta (shown in red) and the 
growing area in Jakarta (in hectares) affected by flooding over time as the city has spread.Urbanization is rapidly increasing in all low- and middle-income countries, often without

66016The SENDAI Framework for  Disaster Risk 

Reduction Now that we have some of the background about why disaster is a significant risk to 
manage in SE Asia and the Pacific, let™s now look at a framework for actions in managing 

disaster risk: the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction Œ or UNISDR - Hyogo 
Framework.
Module 15: Disaster risk management66117Key Message from: Hyogo to Sendai Œ
The UN™s World Conference on Disaster Reduction, in Kobe Japan in 2005, began the 
process of pushing international agencies and national governments toward setting clear 
target and commitments for disaster risk management. The first step in this process was 
the forma approval at the WCDR of the Hyogo Framework for Action. This is the first 

internationally accepted framework for disaster risk management. There is a UN Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction held every other year at which the UN and its member states can review progress against the Hyogo Framework. 
In March 2015, the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) has come to an end and replaced 
by a new post-2015 international framework for disaster risk reduction (Sendai). There 
have been calls for an improved version of the current HFA and thus the sendai framework 

is the product (March 2015), with a set of common standards, a comprehensive framework 

with achievable targets, and a legally-based instrument for disaster risk management. Member states have also emphasized the need to tackle disaster risk management and climate change adaption when setting the Sustainable Development Goals and these 
concepts are incorporated also in the Sendai Framework for action.
History Hyogo frameworks fro Action Œ2005 -2015 ŒCalled for governments , international and national agencies to 
mainstream Disaster

Action stated in Sendai framework  is Addressing climate change as one of the drivers of disaster 
riskThe UN Convention on CC represents an opportunity to reduce disaster risk in a meaningful and coherent manner throughout the interrelated intergovernmental processes.  Building on the Hyogo Framework for Action, this Framework aims to achieve the following outcome over the next 15 years:The substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets Sendai Framework for DRR 2015-2030
One of the key lessons/gaps of the Hyogo Framework for Action is Para 13 Addressing 
climate change as one of the drivers of disaster risk, while respecting the mandate of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, represents an opportunity 

to reduce disaster risk in a meaningful and coherent manner throughout the interrelated 
intergovernmental processes. Building on the Hyogo Framework for Action, this Framework aims to achieve the following 
outcome over the next 15 years:Module 15: Disaster risk management66319Sendai Framework for DRR 2015-2030
To attain the expected outcome, the following goal must be 
pursued:Prevent new and reduce existing disaster risk through the implementation of integrated and inclusive economic, 
structural, legal, social, health, cultural, educational, 
environmental, technological, 
political and institutional measures that prevent and reduce hazard exposure 
and vulnerability to disaster, increase preparedness 
for response and recovery, and thus strengthen 
resilience Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
66420Four priority areas of Sendai 
Understanding disaster riskStrengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilienceEnhancing disaster preparedness for e˜ective response, and to ﬁBuild Back Betterﬂ in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction.Taking into account the experience gained through the implementation of the Hyogo 
Framework for Action, and in pursuance of the expected outcome and goal, there is a 

need for focused action within and across sectors by States at local, national, regional and 
global levels in the following four priority areas: 1. Understanding disaster risk.
2. Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk. 

3. Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience. 

4. Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response, and to ﬁBuild Back Betterﬂ 
in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction. 
In their approach to disaster risk reduction, States, regional and international organizations and other relevant stakeholders should take into consideration the key activities listed 
under each of these four priorities and should implement them, as appropriate, taking 
into consideration respective capacities and capabilities, in line with national laws and 
regulations. In the context of increasing global interdependence, concerted international cooperation, an enabling international environment and means of implementation are needed to 
stimulate and contribute to developing the knowledge, capacities and motivation for 
disaster risk reduction at all levels, in particular for developing countries.Module 15: Disaster risk management66521Goal of this Framework, seven global targets have been agreed. These targets will be measured 
at the global level and will be complemented by work to develop appropriate indicators.
National targets and indicators will contribute to the achievement of the outcome and goal of 
this Framework. The seven global targets are: 
(a) Substantially reduce global disaster mortality by 2030, aiming to lower the average 
per 100 000 global mortality rate in the decade 2020-2030 compared to the period 
2005-2015;(b) Substantially reduce the number of affected people globally by 2030, aiming to 
lowerthe average global figure per 100 000 in the decade 2020-2030 compared to 
the period 2005-2015;(c) Reduce direct disaster economic loss in relation to global gross domestic product 
(GDP) by 2030;(d) Substantially reduce disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic 
services, among them health and educational facilities, including through developing 
their resilience by 2030;(e) Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk 
reduction strategies by 2020;(f) Substantially enhance international cooperation to developing countries through

66824This slide lists the key components of effective disaster risk management. Risks need to be identified and understood so that the actions can be identified to reduce the underlying 
risk factors. Previous slides provided an overview off drivers of disaster risk. Disaster 
preparedness and emergency management are key to reducing the risks of extreme 
weather and climate events. Building institutional and financial capacities and resources is 
important as countries start facing an increasing number of extreme weather and climate 
events.The cross-cutting issues are important for ensuring broad buy-in to the program, linkage 
across local to national scales, and collection lessons learned to share with other health 
authorities to facilitate uptake of best practices.Source: The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. 2014. Hyogo Framework for Action. http://

Œ˝Œ˛ŒModule 15: Disaster risk management66925Stakeholders in the Navua local level risk management project, FijiSource: Geroet al. (2011)This figure shows the Navua (Fii) local to global stakeholders for their disaster risk management. A disaster 
risk management project began in 2007 and built upon an earlier project to develop an early warning 
system for flood. The early warning system was implemented following major flooding of the Navua river 
system in 2004. The 2004 event and previous flood events in Navua resulted in widespread damage 
to homes, infrastructure, and subsistence and commercial agriculture. The follow-up project aimed to 

raise the awareness of the early warning system while at the same time, mainstream the issue of disaster 
risk management into provincial planning and development. The Local Level Risk Management (LLRM) 
approach was employed, which addresses risk in areas defined by similar natural and physical hazards, 
and not bounded by political or administrative borders that often define risk management strategies.This figure shows the local to global partners involved in the project. Many of the major players in DRR in the country and region are involved, the Fiji Red Cross, with technical input from their global partner, 

the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), SOPAC (initiated the early 

warning system along with the Fiji Public Works (Hydrology Division) and Fiji Meteorological Service), 

the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), TAF/OFDA for training assistance, and global donors 

such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR, 

a UNDP body) who also provide technical assistance in devising strategies for implementation.This slide can be used to ask participants:

67026This slide, from the project shown on the previous slide, highlights the differences and overlap between climate change adaptation and disaster risk management.Disaster risk management has a long history in the region. There has been growing realization that climate change is an urgent issue to which countries needs to pay attention. There are increasing 
efforts to integrate these activities. Challenges to doing so include institutional, financial, and political 

barriers that inhibit actors and stakeholders from truly collaborating and creating cross-disciplinary 

programs. Adaptation focuses on climate variability and change only, takes a longer-term perspective, 

is more focused on proactive efforts to increase resilience, and has high political interest. Disaster risk 
management covers all ﬁnatural hazardsﬂ, builds on experience and knowledge (e.g. generally does not 

use projections of potential future changes), focuses on extremes only, and has low to moderate political 

interest. Funding streams also differ. For example, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) is a funding 

mechanism for adaptation formed under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention 

on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR) is a global 

partnership between the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR), World 

Bank, and donor countries that focuses on disaster risk management. However, at the level of implementation, specific disaster risk management and adaptation activities 
can often be classified as either. For example, mangrove habitats are well known to provide a barrier 

to coastal risks whilst also serving as a crucial element of the coastal and estuarine environment. With 

the threat of rising seas and increased coastal erosion associated with more frequent severe weather, 

mangroves are also a possible intervention to prepare for additional climate change. Source: Gero A, et al. 2011. How local communities and global development agencies reduce vulnerability to natural 
disasters and climate change: Examples from the Pacific. Natural hazards and earth system sciences.

important tool for managing risk: early warning and response systemsClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
67228This is the first of two slides providing a synthesis of attributes of and requirements for early warning systems. Early warning systems are being successfully used in many circumstances to increase the lead time before an outbreak occurs, to take advantage of growing understanding of the 
associations between environmental variables and adverse health outcomes. Effective early 
warning systems provide needed time to undertake actions to prevent significant numbers 
of cases.Strong stakeholder engagement will help ensure an early warning system addresses local needs and constraints.As noted in the slide, there has to be sufficient public health and social infrastructure for an 
early warning system to be effective.Source: International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). 2012. http://www.ifrc.org/

67632This slide lists some of the issues with using climate information in early warning systems. The spatial and temporal scale of the critical weather variables need to match well-enough 

with the health data. Appropriate statistical methods need to be applied to the analysis. 
The analysis must be credible, timely, etc. and address key issues raised by decision-makers 

and the public. The analyses should consider all relevant factors that affect the appearance 
of a disease outbreak (such as location of vulnerable populations, etc.).Source: http://www.ifrc.org/PageFiles/103323/1227800-IFRC-CEWS-Guiding-Principles-EN.pdf

observed Oct 97-Sep 98 (cross hatched bars), and the long-term average (1965-1995) (black bars)

Samoa. 1997/98 was when the largest El Nino on record occurred. The black bars show 
the average precipitation in non-El Niño years, showing the large impact these events have 
in many Pacific nations
Overall, for the 12-month period, the predictions were very accurate. However, at 
certain locations, there were some problems in predicting the onset of the drought and 
in anticipating the return of rains that broke the drought. For example, the onset of the 

drought was predicted a few weeks too early for Guam, Saipan, Palau, and Yap. And the 

drought onset was predicted to start a few weeks too late for Kosrae and American Samoa. 

It was even more difficult to predict the re-establishment of the rains. For example, the 

drought was forecast to end several weeks too early for Guam, Saipan, and American 
Samoa, and several weeks too late for Yap, Palau, and the Marshall Islands. Part of the 

problem in determining the end of the drought is that there was no real definition of the 
ﬁend of droughtﬂ. The correlations between El Niño and rainfall were used to prepare nations for expected impacts in the 1997/98 El Niño. Governments developed public education programs, 
implemented water rationing, identified emergency food and water supplies, and other 

activities.Source: School of Ocean & Earth Science & Technology Hawaii. 2009. Pacific ENSO Update. 1st Quarter

how specific interventions will be implemented, and to whom the interventions will 
be communicated. Health professionals need to be integral to the team developing a

Module 15: Disaster risk management67935Once an early warning system is implemented, there needs to be ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the system to ensure it is timely and effective. The slides lists some of the 
requirements of an effective monitoring and evaluation program.Participants can be asked:

Q: Would anybody like to share their experiences with monitoring and evaluation 
plans for early warning or other systems?Follow up Q: Where there any lessons learned in your country re your monitoring and

Monitoring & evaluationNeed to establish programs to answer these 
questions (at a minimum):
What are the chances that the forecast will be 
wrong? What are the chances of sounding a false alarm, thereby wasting resources & undermining public trust?Is the system as responsive as needed?

68036Climate disaster resilience levels in 10 
zones in DhakaSource:  Parvin& Shaw (2011)When designing an early warning system, it is important to take into consideration the variability in resilience across the region covered. This is an example from Dhaka of variability in climate disaster resilience levels. For 

10 zones, the slide shows the differences in physical, social, economic, institutional, and natural dimensions. 
Each dimension has multiple components. The most important parameters were ecosystem services, 
environmental polices, education and awareness, employment, accessibility of roads, and community 
preparedness. The most important variables were:1. Incorporation of DRR and CCA measures in zone™s development plan
2. Extent of participation of zone™s population in community activities

3. Capacity of zone™s health facility to face emergency/hazardous situations

4. Total % of zone™s population living in proximity to polluted industry/dumping ground/sea/beach

5. % of zone™s annual budget targeting disaster risk management

6. Existence of an emergency team during disaster

7. Extent of use of zone-level hazard maps in development activities

8. Awareness or knowledge of population about the threat and impacts of disasters

9. Extent of support from NGOs/CBOs or religious organizations after a disaster

Module 15: Disaster risk management68137An issue often overlooked in disaster risk management response plans is mental health services. Studies indicate that mental health issues often arise after disasters and can last 
for months after the event. This slide shows the structure of mental health services in 
Bangladesh, with self and family care embedded in care and support outside the formal 
health sector. These are embedded in mental health care through primary health care, 

which is within the purview of community mental health services.The study adapted a framework developed by WHO in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami for providing mental health and psychosocial support after major disasters; 
the framework was adapted to Bangladeshi post-cyclone and post-flood contexts. The 

framework is community-based, it includes both medical and non-clinical components, 

and it could be adapted so that women and the poor are actively sought out and provided 
for. After training, these services could be run by Bangladesh™ s pre-existing 50 000-strong 

Cyclone Preparedness Programme workforce, alongside the country™ s extensive network 

of community-based health workers.Source: Nahar et al. 2014. Increasing the provision of mental health care for vulnerable, disaster-affected

68238Pre-& post-disaster government spending: 
Nepal & Indonesia
dtgiSource:  World Bank (2011)Post-disaster spending fluctuates more than pre-disaster spending, as shown for Nepal 
and Indonesia. Governments can help in effective prevention, but struggle to do so. It 
is difficult to measure how much governments spend on prevention because this is not 
a specific budget item. Detailed analysis in Indonesia and Nepal found that prevention 
spending was less than post-disaster spending. But this does not imply that it was ﬁtoo 

little,ﬂ for it is hard to isolate what constitutes prevention and even harder to determine 
adequate spending. Effective prevention measures are often embedded in other spending 

(in such infrastructure as an embankment), and there are indications that reversing the past 
neglect of maintenance (painting bridges to reduce corrosion and subsequent failure) and 
investing in intangibles (tallying decrepit structures) has large benefits.This pattern also highlights that there is often a window of opportunity after a disaster to encourage financing projects to prepare for the next disaster.

692To set up to deliver this module, ensure you have: 5 large tables at the back/sides of the room with a pad 
of flip chart paper and markers on it. You™ll also need a blank wall large enough for 10 flipchart pages to 

be put up, blu tak (ideally already divided into small balls) to stick the pages up with, and a pile of markers 
nearby (enough for one for each person). For the closing exercise you™ll need a small pile of wide post it 
notes on each table (enough for 3 post its per person) and one marker pen per person. You™ll also need a 

clear patch on a wall someone in the training room for people to post their post its.Our last module for this training package is on communicating climate change and health. We haven™t 
left this till last because it™s least important. In fact, we think that learning to communicate on health and 
climate is critical. It™s all very well to have new knowledge on the ways that climate change affects health, 
and what we can do to manage and reduce the impacts. But acting on that knowledge is what™s then 
important, in order to create change in the communities, regions and countries we work in.Module 16: Communicating climate change & health 
Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
6942Key messages in Module 16Communicating the main 
messages of climate change & health 
is one of the health sector™s responsibilitiesIt is important to know the fundamentals 
of good communicationClarifying the message will help to advocate 
for appropriate responses to the health risks posed by climate change
There are three key messages from this short module on communication:1. The importance of professionals within the health sector strengthening their skills 
to communicate the main issues around health and climate change. No one else is necessarily going to do this for us, so we need to become more visible and ‚front- 
and Œcentre™ of this discussion.2. We are very rarely taught the basics of good communication, and it is vital that we 
understand what these are in order to continue our advocacy and research work.3. If we are clearer about our messages, and how to relay these, then this will assist 
our ability to advocate.Module 16: Communicating climate change & health6953This is a short module, and will be centered around two main areas Œ the first is the basics of communication. That is, why do we communicate? With whom do we communicate 

(i.e. our audience)? How do we communicate? And what do we communicate?We will end the module by illustrating the 6 main tenets of good communication, which is 
based on a framework developed by Heath and Heath (2007). You™ll have to wait until the 

end to find out what this acronym stands for!Module 16 outlineCommunicate with WHOM?HOW to communicate56 principles     for good communicationWHAT to communicateWHY communicate?Climate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
6964We start with the four main areas that we need to assess in order to properly develop our message. This 
is relevant for any subject that we are developing communication messages on, not just climate change 
and health.So, firstly, we want to be clear about why we want to communicate this message Œ the ‚why™. Is this 
because the message is unclear? Or that it is just not being heard by those who we think need to hear it? 
We need to make sure that there is a need for the communication, before we go ahead and spend time 

and money on developing our messages.Secondly, we need to identify our audience. Who do we think needs to hear our message? Identifying 
our audience will assist us to target our message. I.e. if our audience is policy makers, then we know that 
the message needs to (for example) outline the problem, the possible solutions and how much this might 
cost Œ it all needs to be very brief and succinct. If we are communicating to community members, we 
might have a bit more flexibility in terms of the amount of material we communicate, and we may need 
to communicate this in a simpler manner that can cut across a variety of experiences and backgrounds.Next, is the ‚how™. We will talk about ‚framing™ in this section, to illustrate how powerful the ‚framing™ or 
setting the issue in an appropriate context, is.And finally the ‚what™. What is it that we actually want to communicate with our messages? We will have 
an interactive discussion around the main points that we feel are the key ones to include in our messages.We™ll now go through each of these in more detail.

698ﬁWhy do you think we need to communicate around climate change and health?
What are the first thoughts that jump into your head to justify communicating the health impacts of climate change? Raise your hand if you have a reason why. A few words is fine.ﬂ
Facilitate responses, getting a wide range of reasons from across the room. Acknowledge people™s 
responses, and continue to ask ﬁWhy else do we need to communicate?ﬂ
Answers might include:Because CC is a threat to human health and wellbeingClimate change will affect us all
People in SE Asia and the Pacific will be impacted particularly by climate change
Impacts are already being experiencedMany people currently have low levels of understandingWe need to prepare for the health impacts of climate change
Everyone needs to be involved in reducing our contribution to climate changePublic health professionals have an obligation to do their best to prevent CC from harming 
human health Œ therefore it is important that we are involved in effectively informing the 
public and decision-makers about the risks and potential responses. etc.Wrap up the input that™s been provided with a quick summary, thanking people for their input and 

adding in your own or ideas above if any of these are not covered.Why do you think we need 
to communicate around 
climate change & health?6Module 16: Communicating climate change & health699So I think we have a good understanding of why communication around health and climate change is important. Let™s now look at who we are likely to need to communicate with.7Communicate 
with WHOM?Identifying your 
audienceClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
700I™d like you in a minute to define who your audience is in your work in communicating messages around the climate change and health. Whom do you need to reach? Your audiences will vary, depending on the reasons for communicating messages. You 
might be interested in communicating broadly, including with other health professionals, 

professionals in areas related to health (e.g. water, agriculture, disaster management), 

the general public, media agencies, and decision-makers (including bilateral and multi-
lateral donors). Or in your area of responsibility, you might be responsible for reaching a 

particular target group such as women and children.I™ll give you 4 minutes now to list down or map out your key audiences that you want to reach in the notes space next to this slide, or on another piece of paper if you need more space. Please be specific about the departments, groups, and representative organisations 
you may need to influence. Give a time warning: 3 minutes ﬁOk I™ll give you another minute to finish off your 
audience mapping.ﬂ 
4 minutes ﬁAnd I™ll get you to finish off now, thanks.ﬂ
I hope that gave you some specific ideas about who you™re likely to need to communicate 
with when you™re back home. This will likely entail forming a relationship and learning 

more about the needs and priorities of these different audiences. Because we need to 
target our messages differently depending on who our audience is, as we will discuss next.8Whom do you want to communicate 
with on climate change?Module 16: Communicating climate change & health701Once you™ve determined whom you need to communicate with, you then need to 
decide how to communicate. Communicating automatically as we would tend to usually 
is unlikely to work. We are not our audience, and we need to factor in who specifically 

we™re communicating to in designing our message.On the next slides are some steps that make for more effective communication design.9HOW to communicate 
on health & climate changeClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
702The first step is framing your message.Framing is setting an issue within an appropriate context for that audience, to achieve a 
desired interpretation or perspective. Frames can also help communicate why an issue 

might be a problem, who or what might be responsible, and, in some cases, what should 
be done.Framing is not intended to deceive or manipulate people, but to make credible 

climate change information more accessible to the public.Framing can be a subtle artŠeven the choice of a single word can make the 

difference between winning and alienating an audience.While they may not be aware of it, people feel better and more positive about achieving 
their goals and are more likely to sustain their behavior when their goals are framed in a 
manner that feels naturally comfortable to them.Trainer notes.

For future development, the following could be inserted/added here:
Insert a climate change and health example of framing showing the message before and after framing (as slide 11) to make it clear what framing is.Print off a health frame example for reference, turning this into a mini exercise by 
getting pairs to read and discuss the example.101. FramingSetting an issue within 
an appropriate context for that audience, to achieve a desired perspective
Module 16: Communicating climate change & health703Tips for framing how you communicate include:
 (CLICK for each of the four tips)Select a frame/frames that will resonate with your audience. What do they care about? What do they already know about and have familiarity with?Consider the audience™s membership of specific subcultures (groups of people 
with distinct sets of beliefs, or based on race, ethnicity, class, age, gender, religion, 

occupation, etc.).Prepare numerous frames ahead of time (i.e., climate change as a health, religious, 
youth, or economic issue).When framing climate change, be careful not to focus so intently on one particular 
aspect that the audience loses sight of the bigger picture.Source: Psychology of Climate Change Communication: A Guide for Scientists, Journalists, Educators, Political 

Aides, and the Interested Public™, Centre for Research on Environmental Decisions, Columbia University:

704Other helpful tips on how to frame your message around health and climate change are: (CLICK for each of the three tips)Tap into people™s desire to avoid future losses rather than realize future gains.
Present information in a way that makes the audience aware of potential current 
and future losses related to inaction on climate change instead of focusing on 
current and future gains.Remember that audiences may be more likely to make changes to their behavior 
if climate change information is framed as ﬁlosing a little bit now instead of losing 

much more in the future.Source: Psychology of Climate Change Communication: A Guide for Scientists, Journalists, Educators, Political 

Aides, and the Interested Public™, Centre for Research on Environmental Decisions, Columbia University:

a little bit now instead of losing much more in the future™Source: Centre for Research on Environmental Decisions, Columbia UniversityModule 16: Communicating climate change & health705The second tip on how to develop your message is to localise the issue - bring the message close to home. If we can highlight the current and potential impacts of climate change not 
only globally, but also locally then this will increase the audience™s sense of connection 

with the issue.One way to do this is to leverage local extreme weather events, using them as ﬁteachable momentsﬂ during which to relate climate change to the experience of your audience. 
(However, keep in mind that although climate change may increase the chance that a 

particular event will occur, it does not cause an event to take place.)
132. Localise the issueClimate Change and Health Œ Training Modules
706Using examples of ‚win-win™ scenarios is a powerful way for the health community to link 
itself with the broader climate change community, as well as illustrate the savings that can 

be made (financial and GHG) in order to appeal to those segments of the audience that 
need to know the ‚business case™ for change.
We have discussed ‚win-win™ opportunities for health and climate change, so just a 
reminder here of some examples. These include:1. Active transport such as bike riding, which benefits healthier lifestyles and 
reduction in GHG emissions via car use2. Green spaces, leading to cleaner air, more room for physical activity and 
community connection3. Reducing meat consumption, contributing to healthier lifestyles and a reduction in 
methane emissions.143. Use ‚win-win™ examples Module 16: Communicating climate change & health707So a reminder of these three steps in HOW to communicate effectively with your chosen audience on health and climate change:1. Frame
 climate change & health in an appropriate context for the particular 
audience you™re communicating with
2. Localise the issues3. Use 
‚win-win™ examples.15Summary: HOWto communicate on health & climate change1.Frameclimate change & health

708We™ve looked at why, with whom, and how we communicate effectively on climate 
change and health. Next up, WHAT should we communicate to get the message across 

around health and climate change most effectively? There are lots of specific messages you will build up over time in your work, but let™s look at 5 general messages that are valuable foundations for communication around climate 
change and health.16WHAT to communicate 
on climate change & 
healthModule 16: Communicating climate change & health709These 5 points that are valuable foundations for communication around climate change and health are: (CLICK to animate each of the 5 points)1. Climate change is real & human-induced

710NB: This exercise will require 5 empty tables for groups to stand around (free of chairs) with either a pad of flipchart paper or a stack of A4 paper on it and a packet of markers.
ﬁI now want to give you some time to go further into these points and come up with some specific examples. Remember that when we™re generating the content of our communication we need to do this for a specific 
target group in a particular location, which we won™t have for this exercise. So please assume you™re creating 

specific communication messages for the general public in a country in the Asia Pacific.
So for this exercise, in a minute I™ll ask you to divide into 5 groups. Table 1 will be over there (point), table 2 
there Œ point out the five different empty tables in number order around the room. Please divide yourselves 
fairly evenly, so if one table is full you head to another one.ﬂ (You may need to have a few helpers circulate to 

help make this happen.)ﬁWhen you get to your table, write your key point at the top of a flipchart page Œ table 1 will write on 
communication point one (Climate change is real & human-induced), table 2 point 2 etc. I™ll show the slide 
with the 5 communication points again in a minute.I then want you to list down some examples of what that key communication point could sound like when communicated to the public. For example, if you had point 1, ‚Climate change is real & human-induced™, you 

might list as a specific communication example: ‚97% of climate scientists around the world agree that climate 
change is happening and that it is human induced.™ Please write clearly so that others can read the examples 
you come up with. Are there any questions?ﬂ
ﬁOk, please find your way to one of the 5 tables Œ point out 1 Œ 5 again Œ where you™ll have
 7 minutes to come up with some specific examples of this key communication point.ﬂProject the next slide so the 5 communication points are visible and set timer181 Create examples for each key

stick it up in the gallery so we can see some of the great examples you™ve come up with. Please also bring 

a marker or pen with you.ﬂ Once pages are up in a long gallery 
Œ ﬁNow that these great examples are up, please spend the next four minutes exploring this gallery and looking at the examples that others have come up with. As well as 
looking, you™ll also have the chance to vote Œ please place a tick or mark on the examples that you think 

are particularly strong messages to use around climate change and health, using a marker near the wall.ﬂGive a time countdown Œ At 2 mins: ﬁMake sure that you™re getting around to all five pages, and leaving 
a mark on what you think are the strongest communications examples.ﬂ At 3 mins ﬁOk you have another 

minute. Make sure you read over as many of the other examples as you can, and leave your mark on 
those that you think are particularly strong.ﬂ
ﬁThanks everyone. I™ll get you to take a few big steps back from the wall. Looking across the pages, where 
can you see the most marks?ﬂ Get participants to help you find some of the strongest communication messages (as voted by the group) and read them out, stating the key communication point first (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5).ﬁGreat. Well done everybody Œ you™ve come up with some strong examples on what to communicate 
around climate change and health. I hope you™ll bring some of these messages into your future

712In this last section of this module on communicating around health and climate change I™m going to introduce you to 6 principles that make for good communication.206 principles for good 

communication5SUCCESModule 16: Communicating climate change & health713The fundamentals of good communication can be represented by an acronym of six features that spell ‚SUCCES™. These each stand for: (CLICK to display each)S Œ Keeping it simple

U Œ Making your point in an unexpected way Œ preferably not with lots of detailed data in complex tables or graphs, that people might expectC Œ Give concrete examples Œ this way people can relate to what can be quite complex and overwhelming ideas, and not have to use their imaginationC Œ Use credibility to your advantage. An example of this is that 97% of climate scientists agree on the climate science, or that information you™re sharing is from the World Health 

Organisation.E Œ Using emotion is helpful, as this is how humans work Œ despite the fact that we think we are purely rational creatures! But make sure that you don™t overuse emotion, as scaring people is 

also counterproductive, as they are then likely to disengage; and finally,
S Œ Stories bring messages to life. Is there an example of a community who has adapted to climate change whose story you can convey to someone who needs to be convinced on the 
importance of responding to the health effects of climate change? This is likely to be much 
more inspiring and empowering than just talking about the theoretical need for us to act.Source: Heath, C., & Heath, D. (2007). Made to stick: Why some ideas survive and others die. New York.

720To finish off, I™ll ask you now to reflect on three key learnings or take aways Œ things that 
will influence how or what you communicate on health and climate change in your work 
from now on.This might be one of the suggestions from the slides on how to communicate, such as ‚I will frame my message for the specific audience I™m communicating to, not write one 
communication and use it for everyone™. Or it could be a key point you™ll emphasise, or 

one of the SUCCES steps, such as always giving concrete examples of the effect of climate 
change. On your table you™ll see a pile of post it notes. Once you™ve had time to gather your three 
take aways or learnings, please write each one on a separate post it note. When you™ve finished, come and post your note on this wall over here (point).ﬂ

People should automatically move, so shouldn™t require a time count down. Moving over 
to the wall yourself will help remind people of the next step. Encourage informal reading 
and discussion around the post its. If you have time, you can get people to group the post 
its into themes. When time is up/people seem to have had enough, wrap up by thanking everyone and giving an instruction about the lunch break and the time to reconvene.28     Write 2 -3 take awaysfor your work on how you will communicate on
