Introduction to Computer
 
 
Computer
 
A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored 
in its own memory that can accept data (input), process the data according to specified 
rules, produce information 
(output), and store the information for future use

.
 
 
Functionalities of a computer

 
 
Any digital computer carries out five functions in gross terms: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Components
 
Any kind of computers consists of 
HARDWARE 
AND 
SOFTWARE
.
 
 
Hardware:
 
Computer hardware is the collection of
 
physical elements that constitutes a computer 
system. Computer hardware refers to the physical parts or components of a computer 
such as the monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, hard drive disk (HDD), 
system unit (graphic cards, sound cards, m
emory, motherboard and chips), etc. all of 
which are physical objects that can be touched
.

Central Processing Unit (CPU) 

 
A CPU is brain of a computer. It is responsible for

all functions and processes. 
Regarding computing power, the CPU is the most important element of a computer 
system. 
 
 
The CPU is comprised of three main parts

 
* 
Arithmetic

Logic

Uni
t (ALU)
:

E
xecutes all arithmetic and logical operations.
 
Arithmetic 
calculations like as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
. 
Logical operation like compare numbers, letters, or special characters
 
*

Control

Uni
t (CU): 

controls and co

3
.
 
Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory.
 
4
.
 
Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.

Primary Memory:
-
 
1. 
RAM
: Random Access Memory (RAM) is a memory scheme within the computer 
system responsible for storing data on a temporary basis, so that it can be promptly 
accessed by the processor as and when needed. It is volatile in nature, which means 
that data will be e
rased once supply to the storage device is turned off. RAM stores 
data randomly and the processor accesses these data randomly from the RAM 
storage. RAM is considered "random access" because you can access any memory 
cell directly if you know the row and c
olumn that intersect at that cell.
 
2. 
ROM
 
(Read Only Memory): ROM is a permanent form of storage. ROM stays 
active regardless of whether power supply to it is turned on or off
.
 
ROM devices 
do not allow data stored on them to be modified.
 
 
Secondary Memory:
-
 
 
Stores data and programs

permanently

its retained after the

power is turned off
 
 
1. Hard drive (HD): A hard disk is part of a unit, often called a "disk drive," "hard drive," or "hard 
disk drive," that store and provides relatively quick access to 
large amounts of data on an 
electromagnetically char
ged surface or set of surfaces.
 
2. Optical Disk: an optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light as part of the process 
of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives c
an only read from discs, but recent 
drives are commonly both readers and recorders, also called burners or writers. Compact discs, 
DVDs, and Blu
-
ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by 
such drives. Optical drive is the
 
generic name; drives are usually described as "CD" "DVD", or 
"Bluray", followed by "drive", "writer", etc. There are three main types of optical media: CD, 
DVD, and Blu
-
ray disc. CDs can store up to 700 megabytes (MB) of data and DVDs can store up 
to 8.4 
GB of data. Blu
-
ray discs, which are the newest type of optical media, can store up to 50 
GB of data. This storage capacity is a clear advantage over the floppy disk storage media (a 
magnetic media), which only has a capacity of 1.44 MB.

3. Flash Disk
 
A st
orage module made of flash memory chips. A Flash disks have no mechanical platters or access 
arms, but the term "disk" is used because the data are accessed as if they were on a hard drive. The 
disk storage structure is emulated.
 
 
 
 
Output devices 
 
An 
output device is any piece of computer hardware equipment used to communicate 
the results of data processing carried out by an information processing system (such 
as a computer) which converts the electronically generated information into human
-
readable fo
rm.

Software
 
Software is a generic term for organized
 
collections of computer data and
 
instructions, 
often broken into two major
 
categories: system software that
 
provides the basic non
-
task
-
specific
 
functions of the computer, and application software which is used
 
by 
users to accomplish specific tasks.
 
 
 
Software Types
 
A. System software
 
is responsible for controlling, integrating, and
 
managing the 
individual hardw
are components of a computer system so
 
that other software and 
the users of the system see it as a functional unit
 
without having to be concerned 
with the low
-
level details such as
 
transferring data from memory to disk, or 
rendering text onto a display.
 
Ge
nerally, system software consists of an operating 
system and some
 
fundamental utilities such as disk formatters, file managers, 
display
 
managers, text editors, user authentication (login) and management tools,
 
and networking and device control software.
 
 
B
. 
Application software
 
is used to accomplish specific tasks other than
 
just running 
the computer system. Application software may consist of a
 
single program, such 
as an image viewer; a small collection of programs
 
(often called a software 
package) that 
work closely together to accomplish a
 
task, such as a spreadsheet or 
text processing system; a larger collection
 
(often called a software suite) of related 
but independent programs and
 
packages that have a common user interface or 
shared data format, such
 
as Microsoft Office, which consists of closely integrated 
word processor,
 
spreadsheet, database, etc.; or a software system, such as a 
database
 
management system, which is a collection of fundamental programs that
 
may provide some service to a variety of o
ther independent applications.
 
Comparison Application Software and System Software
 
 
System Software
 
Application Software
 
 
Computer software, or just software is a 
general term primarily used for digitally stored 
data such as computer programs and other 
ki
nds of information read and written by 
computers. App comes under computer 
software though it has a wide scope now.
 
Application software, also known as an 
application or an "app", is computer software 
designed to help the user to perform specific 
tasks.
 
Example:
 
 
1) Microsoft Windows
 
2) Linux
 
3) Unix
 
4) Mac OSX
 
5) DOS
 
1) Opera (Web Browser)
 
2) Microsoft Word (Word Processing) 
 
3) Microsoft Excel (Spreadsheet software)
 
4) MySQL (Database Software)
 
5) Microsoft PowerPoint (Presentation Software)
 
6) Adobe Ph
otoshop (Graphics Software) 
 
Interaction:
 
 
Generally, users do not interact with system 
software as it works in the background.
 
Users always interact with application software 
while doing different activities. 
 
 
Dependency:
 
 
System software can run 
independently of the 
application software.
 
Application software cannot run without the 
presence of the system software.

Unit of Measurements
 
Storage measurements
: The basic unit used in computer data storage is called
 
a bit 
(binary digit). Computers use these little bits, which are composed of ones 
and zeros, to do things and talk to other computers. All your files, for 
instance, are kept in the computer as binary files and translated into words 
and pictures by the sof
tware (which is also ones and zeros). This two 

numbers in it. The decimal number system in contrast has ten unique digits, 
zero through nine.

Computers classification


 
 
Computers can be generally classified by size and power as follows, though there is
 
Considerable overlap:
 


 
A small, single
-
user computer based on
 
a microprocessor. In 
addition to the microprocessor, a personal computer has a keyboard for entering 
data, a monitor for displaying information, and a storage device for saving data. 
 

-
user computer. A workstation is like
 
a personal 
computer, but it has a more powerful microprocessor and a higher
-
quality 
monitor. 
 

-
user computer capable of supporting from 10 to hundreds of
 
users simultaneously.
 

-
user computer capable of
 
supporting many hundreds 
or thousands of users simultaneously.
 

of instructions per second.

LAPTOP
: 
A laptop is a battery or AC
-
powered
 
personal computer that can be easily
 
carried and used in a variety of locations.
 
Many laptops are designed to 
have all of the
 
functionality of a desktop computer, whichmeans they can 
generally run the same software and open the same
 
types of files. However
, 
some laptops, such as netbooks, sacrifice
 
some functionality in order to be 
even more portable.
 
 
 
 
 
Netbook
: 
A netbook is a type of laptop that is
 
designed to be even more portable.
 
Netbooks are often cheaper than laptops
 
or desktops. They are generally 
less
 
powerful than other types of computers,
 
but they provide enough power for 
email and internet access, which is
 
where the name "netbook" comes from.
 
Mobile Device
: 
A mobile device is basically any handheld computer. It is designed to 
be
 
extremely portab
le, often fitting in the palm of your hand or in your pocket.
 
Some mobile devices are more powerful, and they allow you to do many
 
of

the same things you can do with a desktop or laptop computer. These
 
include 
tablet computers, e
-
readers, and smartphones.
 
 
 
Tablet Computers
: 
Like laptops, tablet computers are
 
designed to be portable. 
However, they
 
provide a very different computing
 
experience. The most 
obvious difference
 
is that tablet computers don't have
 
keyboards or touchpads. 
Instead, the
 
entire screen 
is touch
-
sensitive, allowing you to type on a virtual 
keyboard
 
and use your finger as a mouse pointer.
 
Tablet computers are mostly 
designed for consuming media, and they are
 
optimized for tasks like web 
browsing, watching videos, reading e
-
books,
 
and playi
ng games. For many 
people, a "regular" computer like
 
a desktop or laptop is still needed in order 
to use some programs.
 
However, the convenience of a tablet computer means 
that it may be
 
ideal as a second computer.
 
 
 
Smartphones
: 
A smartphone is a powerful
 
mobile
 
phone that is designed to run a
 
variety of applications in addition to
 
phone service. They are basically
 
small 
tablet computers, and they
 
can be used for web
 
browsing, watching
 
videos, 
reading e
-
books, playing games and more.
 
 
 
Data, Information an
d Knowledge
 
Data
: Facts and figures which relay something specific, but which are not
 
organized 
in any way and which provide no further information regarding
 
patterns, context, etc. 
So data means "unstructured facts and figures that
 
have the least impact o
n the typical 
manager."
 
 
 
Information
: For data to become information, it must be contextualized,
 
categorized, 
calculated and condensed. Information thus paints a bigger
 
picture; it is data with 
relevance and purpose. It may convey a trend in the
 
environme
nt, or perhaps indicate 
a pattern of sales for a given period of
 
time. Essentially information is found "in 
answers to questions that begin
 
with such words as who, what, where, when, and how 
many".
 
 
Knowledge
: Knowledge is closely linked to doing and implies know
-
how
 
and 
understanding. The knowledge possessed by each individual is a
 
product of his 
experience, and encompasses the norms by which he
 
evaluates new inputs from his 
surroundings
.
 
 
 
 
 
9
 
T
he content of the human mind can be
 
classified into four categories:
 
1. Data: symbols
 
2. Information: data that are processed to be useful; provides answers to
 
"who", "what", 
"where", and "when" questions
 
3. Knowledge: application of data and information; 
answers "how"
 
questions
 
4. Wisdom: evaluated understanding.
 
We need to understand that processing data produced Information and process
 
Information produces Knowledge and so on
 
 
Characteristics of Computer
 
Speed, accuracy, diligence, storage capability a
nd versatility are some of the key
 
characteristics of a computer. A brief overview of these characteristics are
 
 

:
 
The computer can process data very fast, at the rate of millions of
 
instructions 
per second. Some calculations that would have taken h
ours
 
and days to 
complete otherwise, can be completed in a few seconds using
 
the computer. 
For example, calculation and generation of salary slips of
 
thousands of 
employees of an organization, weather forecasting that
 
requires analysis of a 
large amount of
 
data related to temperature, pressure
 
and humidity of various 
places, etc.
 

:
 
Computer provides a high degree of accuracy. For example, the
 
computer 
can accurately give the result of division of any two numbers up
 
to 10 decimal 
places.
 

e
:
 
When used for a longer period of time, the computer does not
 
get tired or 
fatigued. It can perform long and complex calculations with the
 
same speed and 
accuracy from the start till the end.
 
 

:
 
Large volumes of data and information can be stored in
 
the 
computer and also retrieved whenever required. A limited amount of
 
data can 
be stored, temporarily, in the primary memory. Secondary storage
 
devices like 
floppy disk and compact disk can store a l
arge amount of data
 
permanently.
 

:
 
Computer is versatile in nature. It can perform different types of
 
tasks 
with the same ease. At one moment you can use the computer to
 
prepare a letter 
document and in the next moment you may play music or
 
pr
int a document.
 
Computers have several limitations too. Computer can only perform tasks that 
it has
 
been programmed to do. 
 
 
 
 
10
 
Computer cannot do any work without instructions from
 
the user. It executes 
instructions as specified by the user and does not take
 
its own
 
decisions.
 
Computer Viruses

 
Viruses: A virus is a small piece of software that piggybacks on real programs. For 
example, a virus might attach itself to a program such as a spreadsheet program. 
Each time the spreadsheet program runs, the virus ru
ns, too, and it has the 
chance to reproduce (by attaching to other programs) or wreak havoc.
 

-
mail viruses: An e
-
mail virus travels as an attachment to e
-
mail messages, and 
usually replicates itself by automatically mailing itself to dozens of people 
in the victim's e
-
mail address book. Some e
-
mail viruses don't even require

do one thing (it may claim to be a game) but instead does damage 
when you 
run it (it may erase your hard disk). Trojan horses have no way to replicate 
automatically.
 

holes to replicate itself. A copy of the worm scans the network for an
other 
machine that has a specific security hole. It copies itself to the new machine 
using the security hole, and then starts replicating from there, as well.
 
What
 
are
 
some
 
tips
 
to
 
avoid
 
viruses
 
and
 
lessen
 
their
 
impact


 
 
Install anti
-
virus software from
 
a reputable vendor. Update it and use it 
regularly

 
 
In addition to scanning for viruses on a regular basis, install an "on access" 
scanner (included in most anti
-
virus software packages) and configure it to start 
each time you start up your computer. This
 
will protect your system by 
checking for viruses each time you run an executable file

 
 
Use a virus scan before you open any new programs or files that may contain 
executable code. This includes packaged software that you buy from the store 
as well as any 
program you might download from the Internet

 
 
If you are a member of an online community or chat room, be very careful 
about accepting files or clicking links that you find or that people send you 
within the community

 
 
Make sure you back up your data 
(documents, bookmark files, important email 
messages, etc.) on disc so that in the event of a virus infection, you do not lose 
valuable work
