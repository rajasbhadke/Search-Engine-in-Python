   PREFACE 
THE writings of Shakespeare have been justly termed ﬁthe richest, the purest, the fairest, that genius uninspired ever penned.ﬂ  Shakespeare instructed by delighting. His plays alone (leaving mere science out of the question), contain more actual wisdom than the 
whole body of English learning. He is the teacher of 
all goodŠpity, generosity, true courage, love. His 
bright wit is cut out ﬁinto little stars.ﬂ His solid 
masses of knowledge are meted out in morsels and 
proverbs, and thus distributed, there is scarcely a 
corner of the English-speaking world to-day which 
he does not illuminate, or a cottage which he does 
not enrich. His bounty is like the sea, which, though often unacknowledged, is everywhere felt. As his 
friend, Ben Jonson, wrote of him, ﬁHe was not of an age but for all time.ﬂ He ever kept the highroad of human life whereon all travel. He did not pick out by-paths of feeling and sentiment. In his creations 
we have no moral highwaymen, sentimental thieves, 
interesting villains, and amiable, elegant adven-turessesŠno delicate entanglements of situation, in 
which the grossest images are presented to the mind 
disguised under the superficial attraction of style and sentiment. He flattered no bad passion, disguised no 
vice in the garb of virtue, trifled with no just and   
    generous principle. While causing us to laugh at 
folly, and shudder at crime, he still preserves our 
love for our fellow-beings, and our reverence for ourselves.  Shakespeare was familiar with all beautiful 
forms and images, with all that is sweet or majestic 
in the simple aspects of nature, of that indestructible 
love of flowers and fragrance, and dews, and clear 
watersŠand soft airs and sounds, and bright skies 
and woodland solitudes, and moon-light bowers, which are the material elements of poetry,Šand with that fine sense of their indefinable relation to 
mental emotion, which is its essence and vivifying 
soulŠand which, in the midst of his most busy and tragical scenes, falls like 
gleams of sunshine on rocks and ruinsŠcontrasting with all that is rugged or repulsive, and reminding us of the existence of purer 
and brighter elements.  These things considered, what wonder is it that the works of Shakespeare, next to the Bible, are 
the most highly esteemed of all the classics of English literature. ﬁSo extensively have the charac-ters of Shakespeare been drawn upon by artists, poets, and writers of fiction,ﬂ says an American author,ŠﬁSo interwoven are these charac-ters in the great body of English literature, that to be ignorant of the plot of these dramas is often a cause of 
embarrassment.ﬂ  But Shakespeare wrote for grown-up people, for men and women, and in words that little folks 
cannot understand.                                                           Hence this volume. To reproduce the 
entertaining stories contained in the plays of Shakespeare, in a form so simple that children can understand and enjoy them, was the object had in view by the author of these Beautiful Stories from 
Shakespeare.  And that the youngest readers may not 
stumble in pronouncing any unfamiliar names to be 
met with in the stories, the editor has prepared and included in the volume a Pronouncing Vocabulary of Difficult Names. To which is added a collection of 
Shakespearean Quotations, classified in alphabetical 
order, illustrative of the wisdom and genius of the 
world™s greatest dramatist.  E. T. R.     
   
 
   A BRIEF LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE IN the register of baptisms of the parish church of Stratford-upon-Avon, a market town in Warwickshire, England, appears, under date of April 
26, 1564, the entry of the baptism of William, the son of John Shakspeare. The entry is in LatinŠﬁGulielmus filius Johannis Shakspeare.ﬂ  The date of William Shakespeare™s birth has 
usually been taken as three days before his baptism, but there is certainly no evidence of this fact.  The family name was variously spelled, the dramatist himself not always spelling it in the same 
way. While in the baptismal record the name is 
spelled ﬁShakspeare,ﬂ in several authentic autographs 
of the dramatist it reads ﬁShakspere,ﬂ and in the first edition of his works it is printed ﬁShakespeare.ﬂ  
Halliwell tells us, that there are not less than 
thirty-four ways in which the various members of 
the Shakespeare family wrote the name, and in the council-book of the corporation of Stratford, where it is introduced one hundred and sixty-six times during the period that the dramatist™s father was a 
member of the municipal body, there are fourteen different spellings. The modern ﬁShakespeareﬂ is not among them.    
    Shakespeare™s father, while an alderman at 
Stratford, appears to have been unable to write his name, but as at that time nine men out of ten were content to make their mark for a signature, the fact 
is not specially to his discredit.  The traditions and other sources of information about the occupation of Shakespeare™s 
father differ. He is descri
bed as a butcher, a wool-stapler, and a glover, and it is not impossible that he 
may have been all of these simultaneously or at different times, or that if he could not properly be called any one of them, the nature of his occupation 
was such as to make it easy to understand how the 
various traditions sprang up. He was a landed proprietor and cultivator of his own land even before his marriage, and he received with his wife, 
who was Mary Arden, daughter of a country 
gentleman, the estate of Asbies, 56 acres in extent. William was the third child. The two older than he 
were daughters, and both probably died in infancy. 
After him were born three sons and a daughter. For ten or twelve years at least, after Shakespeare™s birth his father continued to be in easy circumstances. In the year 1568 he was the high bailiff or chief magistrate of Stratford, and for many years 

afterwards he held the position of alderman as he 
had done for three years before. To the completion of his tenth year, therefore, it is natural to suppose that William Shakespeare would get the best education that Stratford could afford. The free school of the town was open to all boys, and like all 
                                                         the grammar-schools of that time, was under the direction of men who, as graduates of the 
universities, were qualified to diffuse that sound scholarship which was once the boast of England. 
There is no record of Shakespeare™s having been at this school, but there can be no rational doubt that he was educated there. His father could not have procured for him a better education anywhere. To those who have studied Shakespeare™s works without being influenced by the old traditional theory that he had received a very narrow education, they abound with evidences that he must have been solidly 
grounded in the learning, properly so called, taught in the grammar schools.  There are local associations connected with Stratford which could not be without their influence 
in the formation of young Shakespeare™s mind. Within the range of such a boy™s curiosity were the fine old historic towns of Warwick and Coventry, the sumptuous palace of Kenilworth, the grand 
monastic remains of Evesham. His own Avon 
abounded with spots of singular beauty, quiet hamlets, solitary woods. Nor was Stratford shut out 
from the general world, as many country towns are. It was a great highway, and dealers with every variety 
of merchandise resorted to its markets. The eyes of 
the poet dramatist must always have been open for observation. But nothing is known positively of Shakespeare from his birth to his marriage to Anne Hathaway in 1582, and from that date nothing but 
  
    the birth of three children until we find him an actor 
in London about 1589.  How long acting continued to be Shakespeare™s sole profession we have no means of 
knowing, but it is in the highest degree probable that very soon after arriving in London he began that work of adaptation by which he is known to have begun his literary career. To improve and alter older 
plays not up to the standard that was required at the 
time was a common practice even among the best dramatists of the day, and Shakespeare™s abilities would speedily mark him out as eminently fitted for this kind of work. When the alterations in plays originally composed by other writers became very 
extensive, the work of adaptation would become in reality a work of creation. And this is exactly what 
we have examples of in a few of Shakespeare™s early works, which are known to have been founded on older plays.  It is unnecessary here to extol the published 
works of the world™s greatest dramatist. Criticism has been exhausted upon them, and the finest minds of England, Germany, and America have devoted their powers to an elucidation of their worth.  Shakespeare died at Stratford on the 23d of April, 1616. His father had died before him, in 1602, 
and his mother in 1608. Hi
s wife survived him till 
August, 1623. His son Hamnet died in 1596 at the 

age of eleven years. His two daughters survived him, 
the eldest of whom, Susanna, had, in 1607, married a 
physician of Stratford, Dr. Hall. The only issue of                                                          this marriage, a daughter named Elizabeth, born in 1608, married first Thomas Nasbe, and afterwards Sir John Barnard, but left no children by either marriage. Shakespeare™s younger daughter, Judith, on 
the 10th of February, 1616, married a Stratford 
gentleman named Thomas Quincy, by whom she 
had three sons, all of whom died, however, without 
issue. There are thus no direct descendants of Shakespeare.  Shakespeare™s fellow-actors, fellow-dramatists, 
and those who knew him in other ways, agree in expressing not only admiration of his genius, but 
their respect and love for the man. Ben Jonson said, 
ﬁI love the man, and do honor his memory, on this 
side idolatry, as much as any. He was indeed honest, 
and of an open and free nature.ﬂ He was buried on 
the second day after his death, on the north side of 
the chancel of Stratford church. Over his grave there is a flat stone with this inscription, said to have been 
written by himself:   Good friend for Jesus sake forbeare 
To digg the dust encloased heare: 
Blest be ye man yt spares these stones,
And curst be he yt moves my bones.

    1 A MIDSUMMER NIGHT™S DREAM HERMIA and Lysander were lovers; but 
Hermia™s father wished her to marry another man, 
named Demetrius.  Now, in Athens, where they lived, there was a wicked law, by which any girl who refused to marry 
according to her father™s wishes, might be put to death. Hermia™s father was so angry with her for refusing to do as he wished, that he actually brought 
her before the Duke of Athens to ask that she might 
be killed, if she still refused to obey him. The Duke gave her four days to think about it, and, at the end 
of that time, if she still refused to marry Demetrius, she would have to die.  Lysander of course was nearly mad with grief, 
and the best thing to do seemed to him for Hermia 
to run away to his aunt™s house at a place beyond the 
reach of that cruel law; and there he would come to 
her and marry her. But before she started, she told her friend, Helena, what she was going to do.  
Helena had been Demetrius™ sweetheart long before his marriage with Hermia had been thought 
of, and being very silly, like all jealous people, she 
BEAUTIFUL  STORIES  FROM  SHAKESPEARE  
  2  could not see that it was not poor Hermia™s fault that Demetrius wished to marry her instead of his own lady, Helena. She knew that if she told Demetrius 
that Hermia was going, as she was, to the wood 
outside Athens, he would follow her, ﬁand I can follow him, and at least I shall see him,ﬂ she said to 
herself. So she went to him, and betrayed her friend™s secret.  Now this wood where Lysander was to meet Hermia, and where the other two had decided to fol-low them, was 
full of fairies, 
as most woods are, if one only had the eyes to see them, and in this wood on this night were the King and Queen of the fairies, Oberon and 
Titania. Now fairies 
are very wise people, but now and then they can be quite as foolish as mortal folk. Oberon and 
Titania, who might have been as happy TITANIA:  THE  QUEEN  OF 
THE  FAIRIES A  MIDSUMMER  NIGHT™S  DREAM                                                         3 as the days were long, had thrown away all their joy 
in a foolish quarrel. They never met without saying 
disagreeable things to each other, and scolded each other so dreadfully that all their little fairy followers, 
for fear, would creep into acorn cups and hide them there.  So, instead of keeping one happy Court and 
dancing all night through in the moonlight as is fairies™ use, the King with 
his attendants wandered through one part of the wood, while the Queen with 
hers kept state in another. And the cause of all this trouble was a little Indian
 boy whom Titania had taken to be one of her followers. Oberon wanted the 
child to follow him and be one of his fairy knights; 
but the Queen would not give him up.  On this night, in a mossy moonlit glade, the 
King and Queen of the fairies met.  ﬁIll met by moonlight, proud Titania,ﬂ said the King.  ﬁWhat! jealous, Oberon?ﬂ answered the Queen. ﬁYou spoil everything with your quarreling. Come, fairies, let us leave him. I am not friends with him now.ﬂ  ﬁIt rests with you to make up the quarrel,ﬂ 
said the King.  ﬁGive me that little Indian boy, and I will again be your humble servant and suitor.ﬂ  ﬁSet your mind at rest,ﬂ said the Queen. 
ﬁYour whole fairy kingdom buys not that boy from 
me. Come, fairies.ﬂ  BEAUTIFUL  STORIES  FROM  SHAKESPEARE  
  4  And she and her train rode off down the 
moonbeams.              ﬁWell, go your 
ways,ﬂ said Oberon. ﬁBut I™ll be even with you before you leave 
this wood.ﬂ  Then Oberon called his favorite 
fairy, Puck. Puck was the spirit of 
mischief. He used 
to slip into the dairies and take the cream away, and get into the churn so that the butter would not come, and turn the beer sour, and lead people out of their way on dark nights and then laugh at them, and tumble people™s stools from 
under them when they were going to sit down, and upset their hot ale over their chins when they were 
going to drink.  
ﬁNow,ﬂ said Oberon to this little sprite, 
ﬁfetch me the flower called Love-in-idleness. The 
juice of that little purple flower laid on the eyes of those who sleep will make them, when they wake, to 
love the first thing they see. I will put some of the juice of that flower on my Titania™s eyes, and when she wakes she will love the first thing she sees, were THE  QUARREL A  MIDSUMMER  NIGHT™S  DREAM                                                         5 it lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, or meddling monkey, or 
a busy ape.ﬂ      While Puck was gone, Demetrius passed 
through the glade followed by poor Helena, and still she told him how she loved him and reminded him  
of all his promises, and still he told her that he did

WOOD
 BEAUTIFUL  STORIES  FROM  SHAKESPEARE  
  6  not and could not love her, and that his promises 
were nothing. Oberon was sorry for poor Helena, 
and when Puck returned with the flower, he bade 
him follow Demetrius and put some of the juice on his eyes, so that he might love Helena when he woke and looked on her, as much as she loved him. So Puck set off, and wandering through the wood found, not Demetrius, but Lysander, on whose eyes 
he put the juice; but when Lysander woke, he saw not his own Hermia, but Helena, who was walking through the wood looking for the cruel Demetrius; and directly he saw her he loved her and left his own 
lady, under the spell of the purple flower.  
When Hermia woke she found Lysander 
gone, and wandered about the wood trying to find 
him. Puck went back and told Oberon what he had 
done, and Oberon soon found that he had made a mistake, and set about looking for Demetrius, and having found him, put some of the juice on his eyes. And the first thing Demetrius saw when he woke 
was also Helena. So now Demetrius and Lysander were both following her through the wood, and it 

was Hermia™s turn to follow her lover as Helena had 
done before. The end of it was that Helena and Hermia began to quarrel, and Demetrius and Lysander went off to fight.
 Oberon was very sorry to see his kind scheme to help these lovers turn out so 
badly. So he said to PuckŠ  
ﬁThese two young men are going to fight. 
You must overhang the night with drooping fog, and 
lead them so astray, that one will never find the 
other. When they are tired out, they will fall asleep. A  MIDSUMMER  NIGHT™S  DREAM                                                         7 Then drop this other herb on Lysander™s eyes. That 
will give him his old sigh
t and his old love. Then each man will have the lady who loves him, and they will all think that this has been only a Midsummer Night™s Dream. Then when this is done, all will be 
well with them.ﬂ  
So Puck went and did as he was told, and when the two had fallen asleep without meeting each 
other, Puck poured the juice on Lysander™s eyes, and said:Š   ﬁWhen thou wakest, Thou takest 
True delight 
In the sight 
Of thy former lady™s eye:
Jack shall have Jill; 
Nought shall go ill.ﬂ 
 Meanwhile Oberon found Titania asleep on a bank where grew wild thyme, oxlips, and violets, and 
woodbine, musk-roses and eglantine. There Titania 
always slept a part of the night, wrapped in the enameled skin of a snake. Oberon stooped over her 
and laid the juice on her eyes, saying:Š  
 ﬁWhat thou seest when thou wake,Do it for thy true love take.ﬂ  Now, it happened that when Titania woke the 
first thing she saw was a stup
id clown, one of a party of players who had come out into the wood to BEAUTIFUL  STORIES  FROM  SHAKESPEARE  
  8  rehearse their play. This clown had met with Puck, who had clapped an ass™s head on his shoulders so that it looked as if it grew there. Directly Titania 
woke and saw this dreadful monster, she said, ﬁWhat angel is this? Are you as wi
se as you are beautiful?ﬂ  ﬁIf I am wise enough to find my way out of 
this wood, that™s enough for me,ﬂ said the foolish 
clown.      ﬁDo not desire to go out of the wood,ﬂ said 
Titania. The spell of the love-juice was on her, and 
to her the clown seemed the most beautiful and 
delightful creature on all the earth. ﬁI love you,ﬂ she

to attend on you.ﬂ  So she called four fairies, whose names were Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed.  ﬁYou must attend this gentleman,ﬂ said the Queen. ﬁFeed him with apricots and dewberries, 
purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries. Steal 
honey-bags for him from the bumble-bees, and with the wings of painted butterflies fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes.ﬂ  ﬁI will,ﬂ said one of 
the fairies, and all the 
others said, ﬁI will.ﬂ  
ﬁNow, sit down with me,ﬂ said the Queen to the clown, ﬁand let me stroke your dear cheeks, and stick musk-roses in your smooth, sleek head, and 
kiss your fair 
large ears, my gentle joy.ﬂ  
ﬁWhere™s 
Peaseblossom?ﬂ asked the clown with the ass™s head. He did not care much about the Queen™s affect-tion, but he was very proud of having fairies to wait 
on him. ﬁReady,ﬂ said Peaseblossom.

bee on the top of the thistle yonder, and bring me the honey-bag. Where™s Mustardseed?ﬂ  
ﬁReady,ﬂ said Mustardseed.  
ﬁOh, I want nothing,ﬂ said the clown. ﬁOnly just help Cobweb to scratch. I must go to the barber™s, for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face.ﬂ  ﬁWould you like anything to eat?ﬂ said the fairy Queen.  ﬁI should like some good dry oats,ﬂ said the 
clownŠfor his donkey™s head made him desire 
donkey™s foodŠﬁand some hay to follow.ﬂ  ﬁShall some of my fairies fetch you new nuts 
from the squirrel™s house?ﬂ asked the Queen.  ﬁI™d rather have a handful or two of good dried peas,ﬂ said the clown. ﬁBut please don™t let any of your people disturb me; I am going to sleep.ﬂ  Then said the Queen, ﬁAnd I will wind thee in 
my arms.ﬂ  And so when Oberon came along he found his beautiful Queen lavishing kisses and endearments 
on a clown with a donkey™s head.  
And before he released her from the enchantment, he persuaded her to give him the little Indian boy he so much desired to have. Then he took pity on her, and threw some juice of the BEAUTIFUL  STORIES  FROM  SHAKESPEARE  
  12  disenchanting flower on her pretty eyes; and then in a moment she saw plainly the donkey-headed clown 
she had been loving, and knew how foolish she had been.  Oberon took off the ass™s head from the clown, and left him to finish his sleep with his own 
silly head lying on the thyme and violets.  Thus all was made plain and straight again. Oberon and Titania loved each other more than 
ever. Demetrius thought of no one but Helena, and Helena had never had any thought of anyone but 
Demetrius.  As for Hermia and Lysander, they were as loving a couple as you could meet in a day™s march, 
even through a fairy wood.  
So the four mortal lovers went back to Athens and were married; and the fairy King and Queen live 
happily together in that very wood at this very day.  
    
    13   PROSPERO, the Duke of Milan, was a 
learned and studious man, who lived among his 
books, leaving the management of his dukedom to 
his brother Antonio, in whom indeed he had complete trust. But that trust was ill-rewarded, for 
Antonio wanted to wear the duke™s crown himself, and, to gain his ends, would have killed his brother but for the love the people bore him. However, with the help of Prospero™s great enemy, Alonso, King of Naples, he managed to get into his hands the dukedom with all its honor, power, and riches. For they took Prospero to sea, and when they were far 
away from land, forced him into a little boat with no tackle, mast, or sail. In their cruelty and hatred they put his little daughter, Miranda (not yet three years old), into the boat with him, and sailed away, leaving 
them to their fate.  But one among the courtiers with Antonio 
was true to his rightful master, Prospero. To save the duke from his enemies was impossible, but much BEAUTIFUL  STORIES  FROM  SHAKESPEARE  
  14  could be done to remind him of a subject™s love. So this worthy lord, whose name was Gonzalo, secretly 
placed in the boat some fresh water, provisions, and clothes, and what Prospero valued most of all, some of his precious books.  The boat was cast on an island, and Prospero and his little one landed in safety. Now this island 
was enchanted, and for years had lain under the spell 
of a fell witch, Sycorax, who had imprisoned in the 
trunks of trees all the good spirits she found there. She died shortly before Prospero was cast on those shores, but the spirits, of whom Ariel was the chief, 
still remained in their prisons.  
Prospero was a great magician, for he had 
devoted himself almost entirely to the study of magic during the years in which he allowed his brother to 
manage the affairs of Milan. By his art he set free the 
imprisoned spirits, yet kept them obedient to his 
will, and they were more truly his subjects than his people in Milan had been. For he treated them 
kindly as long as they did his bidding, and he exercised his power over them wisely and well. One 
creature alone he found it necessary to treat with harshness: this was Caliban, the son of the wicked 
old witch, a hideous, deformed monster, horrible to 
look on, and vicious and brutal in all his habits.   
When Miranda was grown up into a maiden, 
sweet and fair to see, it chanced that Antonio and 
Alonso, with Sebastian, his brother, and Ferdinand, his son, were at sea together with old Gonzalo, and their  ship  came  near  
Prospero™s  island.  Prospero, THE  TEMPEST 
                                                        15 knowing they were there, raised by his art a great storm, so that even the sailors on board gave  
themselves up for lost; and first among them all Prince Ferdinand leaped into the sea, and, as his father thought in his grief, was drowned. But Ariel brought him safe ashore; and all the rest of the crew, although they were washed overboard, were landed 
unhurt in differ-rent parts of the island, and the good ship her-self, which they all thought had been wrecked, lay at anchor in the harbor whi-ther Ariel had brought her. Such wonders could Prospero and his spirits perform.  
While yet the tempest was raging, Prospero showed his daughter the brave ship laboring in the trough of the sea, and told her that it was filled with 
living human beings like themselves. She, in pity of 
their lives, prayed him who had raised this storm to 
quell it. Then her father bade her to have no fear, for 
he intended to save every one of them.  Then, for the first time, he told her the story of his life and hers, and that he had caused this storm to rise in order that his enemies, Antonio and 
PRINCE

  16  Alonso, who were on board, might be delivered into his hands.  When he had made an end of his story he charmed her into sleep, for Ariel was at hand, and he had work for him to do. Ariel, who longed for his complete freedom, grumbled to be kept in drudgery, but on being threateningly reminded of all the suf-
ferings he had undergone when Sycorax ruled in the land, and of the debt of gratitude he owed to the master who had made those sufferings to end, he ceased to complain, and promised faithfully to do 
whatever Prospero might command.  ﬁDo so,ﬂ said Prospero, ﬁand in two days I will discharge thee.ﬂ  Then he bade Ariel take the form of a water 
nymph and sent him in search of the young prince. 
And Ariel, invisible to Ferd
inand, hovered near him, singing the whileŠ   ﬁCome unto these yellow sands And then take hands: Court™sied when you have, and kiss™d
(The wild waves whist), 
Foot it featly here and there; And, sweet sprites, the burden bear!ﬂ
 And Ferdinand followed the magic singing, as the

him in good time.  Many tricks did Ariel play them. Once he set a 
banquet before them, and just as they were going to fall to, he appeared to them amid thunder and 
lightning in the form of a harpy, and immediately the banquet disappeared. Then Ariel upbraided them with their sins and vanished too.  
Prospero by his enchantments drew them all to the grove without his cell, where they waited, trembling and afraid, and now at last bitterly repenting them of their sins.  Prospero determined to make one last use of his magic power, ﬁAnd then,ﬂ said he, ﬁI™ll break my

welcomed with great joy by

happy, and not only because he had found his own again, but chiefly because, when his bitterest foes

    23 AS YOU LIKE IT THERE was once a wicked Duke named Frederick, who took the dukedom that should have belonged to his brother, sending him into exile. His 
brother went into the Forest of Arden, where he 
lived the life of a bold forester, as Robin Hood did in Sherwood Forest in merry England.  
The banished Duke™s daughter, Rosalind, remained with Celia, Frederick™s daughter, and the two loved each other more than most sisters. One day there was a wrestling match at Court, and Rosalind and Celia went to see it. Charles, a 
celebrated wrestler, was there, who had killed many men in contests of this kind. Orlando, the young man he was to wrestle with, was so slender and youthful, that Rosalind and Celia thought he would 
surely be killed, as others had been; so they spoke to 
him, and asked him not to attempt so dangerous an adventure; but the only effect of their words was to 
make him wish more to come off well in the encounter, so as to win praise from such sweet 
ladies.  Orlando, like Rosalind™s father, was being 
kept out of his inheritance by his brother, and was so 
BEAUTIFUL  STORIES  FROM  SHAKESPEARE  
  24  sad at his brother™s unkindness that, until he saw 
Rosalind, he did not care much whether he lived or 
died. But now the sight of the fair Rosalind gave him 
strength and courage, so that he did marvelously, and at last, threw Charles to such a tune, that the 
wrestler had to be carried off the ground. Duke Frederick was pleased with his courage, and asked his name.    ﬁMy name is Orlando, and I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys,ﬂ said the young man.  
Now Sir Rowland de Boys, when he was alive, 
had been a good friend to the banished Duke, so that Frederick heard with regret whose son Orlando ROSALIND  AND

delighted to hear that this handsome young stranger 
was the son of her father™s old friend, and as they were going away, she turned back more than once to 
say another kind word to the brave young man.  
ﬁGentleman,ﬂ she said, giving him a chain 
from her neck, ﬁwear this for me. I could give more, but that my hand lacks means.ﬂ  
   Rosalind and Celia, when they were alone, 
began to talk about the handsome wrestler, and 
Rosalind confessed that she loved him at first sight.  ﬁCome, come,ﬂ said Celia, ﬁwrestle with thy 
affections.ﬂ  ﬁOh,ﬂ answered Rosalind, ﬁthey take the part of a better wrestler than myself. Look, here comes

  26  ﬁWith his eyes full of anger,ﬂ said Celia.  
ﬁYou must leave the Court at once,ﬂ he said to Rosalind. ﬁWhy?ﬂ she asked.  ﬁNever mind why,ﬂ answered the Duke, ﬁyou are banished. If within ten days you are found within twenty miles of my Court, you die.ﬂ  
So Rosalind set out to seek her father, the banished Duke, in the Forest of Arden. Celia loved 
her too much to let her go alone, and as it was rather a dangerous journey, Rosalind, being the taller, 
dressed up as a young countryman, and her cousin as a country girl, and Rosalind said that she would be called Ganymede, and Celia, Aliena. They were very 
tired when at last they came to the Forest of Arden, and as they were sitting on the grass a countryman passed that way, and Ganymede asked him if he 
could get them food. He did so, and told them that a shepherd™s flocks and house were to be sold. They bought these and settled down as shepherd and 
shepherdess in the forest.  
In the meantime, Oliver having sought to take 
his brother Orlando™s life, Orlando also wandered into the forest, and there met with the rightful Duke, 
and being kindly received, stayed with him. Now, 
Orlando could think of nothing but Rosalind, and he went about the forest carving her name on trees, and 
writing love sonnets and hanging them on the bushes, and there Rosalind and Celia found them. One day Orlando met them, but he did not know Rosalind in her boy™s clothes, though he liked the AS  YOU  LIKE  IT

ﬁThere is a foolish lover,ﬂ said Rosalind, 
ﬁwho haunts these woods and hangs sonnets on the trees. If I could find him, I would soon cure him of his folly.ﬂ  
Orlando confessed that he was the foolish lover, and Rosalind saidŠﬁIf you will come and see 
me every day, I will pretend to be Rosalind, and I will take her part, and be wayward and contrary, as is 
the way of women, till I make you ashamed of your folly in loving her.ﬂ  
And so every day he went to her house, and took a pleasure in saying to her all the pretty things 
he would have said to Rosalind; and she had the fine and secret joy of knowing that all his love-words came to the right ears. Thus many days passed pleasantly away.  One morning, as Orlando was going to visit 
Ganymede, he saw a man asleep on the ground, and that there was a lioness crouching near, waiting for 
the man who was asleep to wake: for they say that 
lions will not prey on anything that is dead or sleeping. Then Orlando looked at the man, and saw that it was his wicked brother, Oliver, who had tried 
to take his life. He fought with the lioness and killed 
her, and saved his brother™s life.  While Orlando was fighti
ng the lioness, Oliver woke to see his brother, whom he had treated so badly, saving him from a wild beast at the risk of his own life. This made him repent of his wickedness, BEAUTIFUL  STORIES  FROM  SHAKESPEARE  
  28  and he begged Orlando™s pardon, and from 
thenceforth they were dear brothers. The lioness had wounded Orlando™s arm so much, that he could not go on to see the shepherd, so he sent his brother to ask Ganymede to come to him.  
   Oliver went and told the whole story to Ganymede and Aliena, and Aliena was so charmed with his manly way of confessing his faults, that she 
fell in love with him at once. But when Ganymede heard of the danger Orlando had been in she fainted; and when she came to herself, said truly enough, ﬁI 
should have been a woman by right.ﬂ Oliver went back to his brother and told him all this, saying, ﬁI love Aliena so well that I will give

Orlando, ﬁand I will ask the Duke and his friends.ﬂ  
When Orlando told Ganymede how his 
brother was to be married on the morrow, he added: ﬁOh, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man™s eyes.ﬂ  Then answered Rosalind, still in Ganymede™s dress and speaking with his voiceŠﬁIf you do love Rosalind so near the heart, then when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marry her.ﬂ  Now the next day the Duke and his followers, 
and Orlando, and Oliver, and Aliena, were all 
gathered together for the wedding.  
Then Ganymede came in and said to the Duke, ﬁIf I bring in your da
ughter Rosalind, will you 
give her to Orlando here?ﬂ ﬁThat I would,ﬂ said the Duke, ﬁif I had all kingdoms to give with her.ﬂ  
ﬁAnd you say you will have her when I bring her?ﬂ she said to Orlando. ﬁThat would I,ﬂ he 
answered, ﬁwere I king of all kingdoms.ﬂ  
Then Rosalind and Celia went out, and Rosalind put on her pretty woman™s clothes again, and after a while came back.  She turned to her fatherŠﬁI give myself to you, for I am yours.ﬂ ﬁIf there be truth in sight,ﬂ he said, ﬁyou are my daughter.ﬂ  BEAUTIFUL  STORIES  FROM  SHAKESPEARE  
  30  Then she said to Orlando, ﬁI give myself to 
you, for I am yours.ﬂ ﬁIf there be truth in sight,ﬂ he said, ﬁyou are my Rosalind.ﬂ  
ﬁI will have no father if you be not he,ﬂ she said to the Duke, and to Orlando, ﬁI will have no 
husband if you be not he.ﬂ  So Orlando and Rosalind were married, and 
Oliver and Celia, and they lived happy ever after, returning with the Duke to the kingdom. For 
Frederick had been shown by a holy hermit the wickedness of his ways, and so gave back the 
dukedom of his brother, and himself went into a monastery to pray for forgiveness.  The wedding was a merry one, in the mossy glades of the forest. A shepherd and shepherdess who had been friends with Rosalind, when she was 
herself disguised as a she
pherd, were married on the same day, and all with such pretty feastings and 
merrymakings as could be nowhere within four walls, but only in the beautiful green wood.     
   
 
    31 THE WINTER™S TALE LEONTES was the King of Sicily, and his dearest friend was Polixenes, King of Bohemia. They 
had been brought up together, and only separated 
when they reached man™s estate and each had to go and rule over his kingdom. After many years, when each was married and had a son, Polixenes came to stay with Leontes in Sicily.  
Leontes was a violent-tempered man and rather silly, and he took it into his stupid head that 
his wife, Hermione, liked Polixenes better than she did him, her own husband. When once he had got 
this into his head, nothing could put it out; and he 
ordered one of his lords, Camillo, to put a poison in 
Polixenes™ wine. Camillo tried to dissuade him from 
this wicked action, but finding he was not to be moved, pretended to consent. He then told 
Polixenes what was proposed against him, and they fled from the Court of Sicily that night, and returned 
to Bohemia, where Camillo lived on as Polixenes™ 
friend and counselor.  
Leontes threw the Queen into prison; and her 
son, the heir to the throne, died of sorrow to see his mother so unjustly and cruelly treated.  
BEAUTIFUL  STORIES  FROM  SHAKESPEARE  
  32  While the Queen was in prison she had a little baby, and a friend of hers, named Paulina, had the 
baby dressed in its best, and took it to show the King, thinking that the sight of his helpless little daughter would soften his heart towards his dear Queen, who had never done him any wrong, and who loved him a great deal more than he deserved; 
but the King would not look at the baby, and ordered Paulina™s husband to 
take it away in a ship, and 
leave it in the most desert and dreadful place he could find, which Pau-
lina™s husband, very much against his will, was obliged to do.  Then the poor Queen was brought up to be tried for treason in preferring 
Polixenes to her King; but really she had 
never thought of anyone except Leontes, her husband. Leontes had sent some messengers to ask 
the god, Apollo, whether he was not right in his 
cruel thoughts of the Queen. But he had not patience to wait till they came back, and so it 
happened that they arrived in the middle of the trial. The Oracle saidŠ  THE  KING  WOULD  NOT

lost be not found.ﬂ  Then a man came and told them that the little Prince was dead. The poor Queen, hearing this, fell down in a fit; and then the King saw how wicked 
and wrong he had been. He ordered Paulina and the ladies who were with the Queen to take her away, and try to restore her. But Paulina came back in a 
few moments, and told the King that Hermione was dead.  Now Leontes™ eyes were at last opened to his folly. His Queen was dead, and the little daughter 
who might have been a comfort to him he had sent away to be the prey of wolves and kites. Life had 
nothing left for him now. He gave himself up to his 
grief, and passed many sad years in prayer and 
remorse.  The baby Princess was left on the seacoast of Bohemia, the very kingdom where Polixenes 
reigned. Paulina™s husband never went home to tell 
Leontes where he had left the baby; for as he was 
going back to the ship, he met a bear and was torn 
to pieces. So there was an end of him.  
But the poor deserted little baby was found by a shepherd. She was richly dressed, and had with her some jewels, and a paper was pinned to her cloak, saying that her name was Perdita, and that she came 
of noble parents.  BEAUTIFUL  STORIES  FROM  SHAKESPEARE  
  34     The shepherd, being a kind-hearted man, took home the little baby to his wife, and they brought it up as their own child. She had no more teaching than a shepherd™s child generally has, but she 
inherited from her royal mother many graces and charms, so that she was quite different from the other maidens in the village where she lived.  
One day Prince Florizel, the son of the good King of Bohemia, was hunting near the shepherd™s house and saw Perdita, now grown up to a charming 
woman. He made friends with the shepherd, not telling him that he was the Prince, but saying that his 
name was Doricles, and that he was a private 
gentleman; and then, being deeply in love with the 
pretty Perdita, he came almost daily to see her.  
The King could not understand what it was that took his son nearly every day from home; so he set people to watch him, and then found out that the  LEFT  ON  THE

Perdita, the pretty shepherd girl.  Polixenes, wishing to see whether this was true, disguised himself, and 
went with the faithful Camill
o, in disguise too, to the old shepherd™s house. They arrived at the feast of sheep-shearing, and, though strangers, they were 
made very welcome. There was dancing going on, 
and a peddler was selling ribbons and laces and gloves, which the young men bought for their sweethearts.  Florizel and Perdita, 
however, were taking no part in this gay scene, but sat quietly together talking. 
The King noticed the charming manners and great beauty of Perdita, never guessing that she was the daughter of his old friend, Leontes. He said to 
CamilloŠ  
ﬁThis is the prettiest low-born lass that ever 
ran on the green sward. Nothing she does or seems 
but smacks of something greater than herselfŠtoo

And Camillo answered, ﬁIn truth she is the 
Queen of curds and cream.ﬂ  But when Florizel, who did not recognize his father, called upon the strangers to witness his betrothal with the pretty shepherdess, the King made himself known and forbade the marriage, adding that if ever she saw Florizel again, he would 
kill her and her old father, the shepherd; and with that he left them. But Camillo remained behind, for 
he was charmed with Perdita, and wished to befriend her.  THE  WINTER™S  TALE

was for that foolish madness of his, and he longed to 
go back to Sicily to see his old master. He now proposed that the young people should go there and claim the protection of Leontes. So they went, and the shepherd went with them, taking Perdita™s jewels, 
her baby clothes, and the paper he had found pinned 
to her cloak.

joy, and rewarded the good shepherd.  Polixenes had hastened after his son to prevent his marriage with Perdita, but when he 
found that she was the daughter of his old friend, he was only too glad to give his consent.        Yet Leontes 
could not be happy. He re-membered how his fair Queen, who should have been at his side to share his joy in his daughter™s happiness, was dead through 
his unkindness,

please your Majesty to go and see the statue?ﬂ  So Leontes and Polixenes, and Florizel and 
Perdita, with Camillo and their attendants, went to 
Paulina™s house where there was a heavy purple 
curtain screening off an alcove; and Paulina, with her hand on the curtain, saidŠ  ﬁShe was peerless when she was alive, and I 
do believe that her dead likeness excels whatever yet you have looked upon, or that the hand of man hath done. Therefore I keep it lonely, apart. But here it isŠbehold, and say, ™tis well.ﬂ  
And with that she drew back the curtain and 
showed them the statue. The King gazed and gazed

nothing.  ﬁI like your silence,ﬂ said Paulina; ﬁit the more

could not take his eyes away.  ﬁIf I had known,ﬂ said Paulina, ﬁthat this poor 
image would so have stirred your grief, and love, I would not have shown it to you.ﬂ  But he only answered, ﬁDo not draw the curtain.ﬂ  ﬁNo, you must not look any longer,ﬂ said Paulina, ﬁor you will think it moves.ﬂ  
ﬁLet be! let be!ﬂ said the King. ﬁWould you 
not think it breathed?ﬂ  ﬁI will draw the curtain,ﬂ said Paulina; ﬁyou will think it lives presently.ﬂ  
ﬁAh, sweet Paulina,ﬂ sa
