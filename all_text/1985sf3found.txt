Hello everyone,
  My first time on this BBS..looks pretty descent. Anyways, onto the subject 
of this post. OK say you want to get into COSMOS for whatever reason...well, 
why not try this approach: Call your standard 0 operator and act paniky and 
say "uhhh hello I need to make an emergency call and it's long distance and 
the number is busy and the area code is 914 and help!"...the operator will 
say, "OK well calm down..I first must tell you that if the line is not busy 
I will have to bill you for an operator-relayed call" (At this point you 
should make sure that you give her the number to a BBS like this one that 
is constantly busy)...now eventually (the operator will start dialing all 
kinds of other people  stuff) someone pick up the phone...this is (or should 
be) an inward...you then blast their brains out with a 1000hz tone that you
got onto tape by calling the 1000hz test line 301-256-9907. Now, if all 
goes well you will get a carrier and be put into the middle of COSMOS!

Just a note to those of you w/ boxes who are having problems completing the 
overseas dialing sequence. I personally don't like overseas extenders; the 
connections are too lousy. anyways, you are all familiar with the method of 
overseas boxing, right? Well, as many of you in 914 probably know, you do not 
have enough time to complete the overseas call without getting a message "were 
sorry, etc." Anyways, don't try to get an Inward to do it; her overseas sending
button literally gets stuck...though she is equipped to send the call, she 
can't (only calls in her area code [prefix (s) sometimes, if additional 
routing is required]). Instead, a beter and more efficient method is to dial 
KP+160 + XXX+ST where XXX is 3 digits, and 0 is padded to the RIGHT. For 
example, to dial Italy, you would send KP+160+390+ST. If the country code is 3 
digits long, then the 0 is not need (ex. 599 for St. Maarten would be 
KP+160+599+ST) These operators help in overseas assistance; do not tell them 
that you are the operator. They will ask for the number; give them the country 
code, city code, and number. Then, when they ask for the number you are calling 
from give them something in the 99XX area of numbers (this is the # that the 
call will be billed to). Often they ask if the number is a coinbox, since they 
do not recieve a fortress screening on their TSPS consoles, but the 99XX looks 
like a fortress, so just answer no. Then your call will be completed. For 
those who are on coardboard (I do not imagine too many) an NPA must be included 
before the 160. I find that when boxing off of my 800 number, the easiest way 
to find out where the number falls out is by dialing KP+121+ST after the 
kerchunk, then saying, "Hello, is this the 303 inward (make any up)? When they 
say no, tell them you are terribly confused, which Inward is this? They will 
tell you their A/C. Then next time you dial KP + 160+XXX+ST, just give them a 
99XX number in the area code that you found out; often it makes the story look 
a bit more believable. By the way, I know I have been saying it a while, but my 
blue box article is just about done, I have to just change some spelling errors
and minor stuff. That is all.

On a BBS that is as busy as this one always is, you would expect more  
messages. Especially more quality. Two messages back, someone mentioned
how no one was posting. Did he post anything? NO! All he did was complain,  
what the fuck are you doing complaining! If you don't like it the way it is  
do what you can to improve it.
  As far as the Annonymous addresse of the previous message is concerned, do  
you expect info when you are too embarassed to tell us your handle. As far  
as COSMOS is concerned, you probably aren't ready to hack it yet. COSMOS is  
not a system to fool around with. Before attempting to hack COSMOS you should  
be an experienced hacker, fluent in UNIX and is possible fluent in 'C'. Fluent  
in UNIX does not mean knowing that "ls" will give you a directory. It is  
knowing all the commands and syscalls, including the ones user aren't supposed  
to know.
  IBM users, why don't you log on to the IBM board, its lucky if it sees one  
message a week! Don't give up because no one else it posting, post interesting  
thinks and try to get discussions going. I would like to hear from any "C"  
programmers. It wouldn't pay to add a "C" subboard as the PASCAL subboard is  
barely used. Perhaps we would be best off using it as a language board. For  
now I will post all "C" related info on the PASCAL board, I would appreciate  
it if some of you would join me. Let's see if we can do something to improve  
this board!
