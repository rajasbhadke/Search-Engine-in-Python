From the Jason Scott / TEXTFILES.COM Printout Collection

These are original linefeed printouts fed through a Optical Character
Recognition system, with hand-editing done afterwards to clean issues
with text rearrangement and OCR errors. 

The printouts are from a collection dating from 1983-1985, and were
generally made on an Epson MX-80 Dot-Matrix printer connected to an
IBM PC-XT. The Bulletin Board Systems and other services were located
throughout the United States, and captured by Jason Scott, who can
attest to their authenticity.

Spelling errors, content and extraneous system information such as 
prompts and menu items have been left untouched. Errors and other 
artifacts of conversion to this format should be considered in 
determining the validity or historical context of statements in these
printouts.

Sub]: What I like in a BBS 
From: QUANTAM MECHANIC
Date: SAT APR 27 9:20:22 AM

  I for one would like to see somthing different-Lets face it,all the boards 
may have different names and different themes to a certain extent, but basicly 
they're all the same.The new Xanth,if what I hear is true,should be better than
most. As for BBS progs. Apple-Net is the best.

  Say, Mark, when did you join the MPG, the NDC, and the c.e.c.
simultaneously? You're going to be in hot water if you do something like that 
again... Also, the backspaces and the text grafix are annoying to those of us 
at 300 baud trying to do a quick newscan....

  About the late-night calls- you basically don't post your number to everyone 
and then say things that anger people.... No wonder you're getting late-night 
phone calls.

  Yes Mark you do have the right to voice your opinion on here, in fact I enjoy 
it, I like to see a little difference on here...I don't agree with it.. but 
thats beside the point... my point is

  YOU AINT IN MPG... and I dont think you are in NDC... so don't leave those 
letters by your name...or we will hunt you down and kill you..<heheh>

  Perhaps if you just ignore him [Mark GleizerJ, maybe he'll go away. He's 
obviously a misguided cretin looking for attention. So if you ignore him, he 
may stop posting at all...
