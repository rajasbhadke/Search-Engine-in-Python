¥You will use mathematical
tools to measure and predict.¥You will apply accuracy 
and precision when
measuring.¥You will display and
evaluate data graphically.
Why ItÕs Important
The measurement and

mathematics tools
presented here will help

you to analyze data and

make predictions.SatellitesAccurate andprecise measurements are
important when constructing

and launching a satelliteÑ

errors are not easy to
correct later. Satellites, 

such as the Hubble SpaceTelescope
shown here, haverevolutionized scientific
research, as well as

communications.
Think About This 
Physics research has led to
many new technologies, such
as satellite-based telescopes
and communications.What
are some other examples of 
tools developed from physicsresearch in the last 50 years?
2physicspp.comNASA002-010 CH01-S1-845813  3/30/04  1:03 AM  Page 2Do all objects fall at the same rate?
QuestionHow does weight affect the rate at which an object falls?
Procedure
The writings of the Greek philosopher Aristotle
included works on physical science theories.

These were a major influence in the late Middle

Ages. Aristotle reasoned that weight is a factor

governing the speed of fall of a dropped object,
and that the rate of fall must increase inproportion to the weight of the object. 
1.Tape four pennies together in a stack. 
2.Place the stack of pennies on your hand and
place a single penny beside them. 
3.Observe
Which is heaviest and pushes down
on your hand the most?4.Observe
Drop the two at the same time and
observe their motions.AnalysisAccording to Aristotle, what should be the rateof fall of the single penny compared to the
stack? What did you observe?
Critical Thinking
Explain which of the followingproperties might affect the rate of fall of an
object: size, mass, weight, color, shape.

scientific theoryWhat do you think of when you see the word 
physics?Many people 
picture a chalkboard covered with formulas and mathematics: 
Emc2, IV/R, d12at2v0td0. Perhaps you picture scientists in 
white lab coats, or well-known figures such as Marie Curie and Albert
Einstein. Or, you might think of the many modern technologies created

with physics, such as weather satellites, laptop computers, or lasers.
What is Physics?
Physics
is a branch of science that involves the study of the physical
world: energy, matter, and how they are related. Physicists investigate the

motions of electrons and rockets, the energy in sound waves and electric

circuits, the structure of the proton and of the universe. The goal of this

course is to help you understand the physical world.
People who study physics go on to many different careers. Some become
scientists at universities and colleges, at industries, or in research institutes.

Others go into related fields, such as astronomy, engineering, computer

science, teaching, or medicine. Still others use the problem-solving skills of

physics to work in business, finance, or other very different disciplines.

Electric Current
The potential difference, or voltage, across a circuit equals the current
multiplied by the resistance in the circuit. That is, 
V(volts) 
I(amperes)
R(ohms). What is the resistance of a lightbulb that has a 0.75 amperes current when plugged into 
a 120-volt outlet?

Mathematics in Physics
Physics uses mathematics as a powerful language. As illustrated in
Figure 1-1,this use of mathematics often is spoofed in cartoons. In
physics, equations are important 
tools for modeling observations and formaking predictions. Physicists 
rely on theories and experiments withnumerical results to support their conclusions. For example, think back to

the Launch Lab. You can predict that if you drop a penny, it will fall. But how

fast? Different models of falling objects give different answers to how the

speed of the object changes, or on what the speed depends, or which objects

will fall. By measuring how an object falls, you can compare the experimen-

tal data with the results predicted by different models. This tests the models,

allowing you to pick the best one, or to develop a new model.

SI Units
To communicate results, it is helpful to use units that everyone under-
stands. The worldwide scientific community and most countries currently

use an adaptation of the metric system to state measurements. The Syst‘me

International dÕUnit”s, or SI, uses seven base quantities, which are 

shown in 
Table 1-1.
These base quantities were originally defined in 
terms of direct measurements. Other units, called derived units, are created

by combining the base units in various w
ays. For 
example, energy is meas-
ured in joules, where 1 joule equals one kilogram-meter squared per 

second squared, or 1 J1 kgm2/s2. Electric charge is measured incoulombs, where 1 C

The standards for
the kilogram and meter are shown.The International Prototype Meter

originally was measured as the
distance between two marks on 

a platinum-iridium bar, but as

methods of measuring time
became more precise than 

those for measuring length, the
meter came to be defined as 

the distance traveled by light 
in a vacuum in 1/299 792 458 s.

Scientific institutions have been created to define and regulate meas-
ures. The SI system is regulated by the International Bureau of Weights and
Measures in S‘vres, France. This bureau and the National Institute of

Science and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland keep the stan-

dards of length, time, and mass against which our metersticks, clocks, and

balances are calibrated. Examples of two standards are shown in 
Figure 1-3.NIST works on many problems of measurement, including industrial and

research applications.
You probably learned in math class that it is much easier to convert
meters to kilometers than feet to miles. The ease of switching between

units is another feature of the metric system. To convert between SI units,

multiply or divide by the appropriate power of 10. Prefixes are used to

change SI units by powers of 10, as shown in 
Table 1-2.
You often will
encounter these prefixes in daily life, as in, for example, milligrams, 

nanoseconds, and gigabytes. 
Dimensional Analysis
You can use units to check your work. You often will need to use different
versions of a formula, or use a string of formulas, to solve a physics problem.

To check that you have set up a problem correctly, write out the equation or

set of equations you plan to use. Before performing calculations, check that

the answer will be in the expected units, as shown in step 3 of Example

Problem 1. For example, if you are finding a speed and you see that your

answer will be measured in s/m or m/s
2, you know you have made an error
in setting up the problem. This method of treating the units as algebraic
quantities, which can be cancelled, is called 
dimensional analysis.
Dimensional analysis also is used in choosing conversion factors. A
conversionfactoris a multiplierequal to1. For example,because1 kg
1000 g,
you can construct the following conversion factors:

This answer to 
3.97.2 should be rounded to
two significant digits. 
Choose a conversion factor that will make the units cancel, leaving the
answer in the correct units. For example, to convert 1.34 kg of iron ore to
grams, do as shown below.
1.34 kg1100k0gg1340 gYou also might need to do a series of conversions. To convert 43 km/h
to m/s, do the following:
431khm1100k0mm601mhin16m0isn12 m/sSignificant Digits
Suppose you use a meterstick to measure a pen, and you find that the end
of the pen is just past 14.3 cm. This measurement has three valid digits: two

you are sure of, and one you estimated. The valid digits in a measurement

are called significant digits.
The last digit given for any measurement is
the uncertain digit. All nonzero digits in a measurement are significant.Are all zeros significant?
No. For example, in the measurement 0.0860 m,
the first two zeros serve only to locate the decimal point and are not sig-
nificant. The last zero, however, is the estimated digit and is significant.

The measurement 172,000 m could have 3, 4, 5, or 6 significant digits.

This ambiguity is one reason to use scientific notation: it is clear that the
measurement 1.7200
105m has five significant digits. 
Arithmetic with significant digitsWhen you perform any arithmetic
operation, it is important to remember that the result never can be more

precise than the least-precise measurement. To add or subtract measurements, first perform the operation, then
round off the result to correspond to the least-precise value involved. For

example, 3.86 m
2.4 m6.3 m because the least-precise measure is toone-tenth of a meter.
To multiply or divide measurements, perform the calculation and 
then round to the same number of significant digits as the least-precise measurement. For example, 409.2 km/11.4 L
35.9 km/L, because theleast-precise measure has three significant digits.
Some calculators display several additional digits, as shown in 
Figure 1-4,while others round at different points. Be sure to record your answers 
with the correct number of digits. Note that significant digits are consid-

ered only when calculating with measurements. There is no uncertainty

associated with counting (4 washers) or exact conversion factors (24 hours

in 1 day).

Scientific Methods
In physics class, you will make observations, do experiments, and create
models or theories to try to explain your results or predict new answers, as
shown in 
Figure 1-5.This is the essence of a scientific method.All scien-tists, including physicists, obtain data, make predictions, and create com-

pelling explanations that quantitatively describe many different phenomena.

The experiments and results must be reproducible; that is, other scientists

must be able to recreate the experiment and obtain similar data. Written,

oral, and mathematical communication skills are vital to every scientist.
A scientist often works with an idea that can be worded as a 
hypothesis,
which is an educated guess about how variables are related. How can 

the hypothesis be tested? Scientists conduct experiments, take measurements,

and identify what variables are important and how they are related. For

example, you might find that the speed of sound depends on the medium

through which sound travels, but not on the loudness of the sound. You can

then predict the speed of sound in a new medium and test your results.

abcSection 1.1Mathematics and Physics
9Models, laws, and theoriesAn idea, equation, structure, or system can
model the phenomenon you are trying to explain. Scientific models are
based on experimentation. Recall from chemistry class the different mod-

els of the atom that were in use over timeÑnew models were developed to

explain new observations and measurements. 
If new data do not fit a model, both are re-examined. Figure 1-6shows
a historical example. If a very well-established model is questioned, physi-

cists might first look at the new data: can anyone reproduce the results?

Were there other variables at work? If the new data are born out by subse-

quent experiments, the theories have to change to reflect the new findings.

For example, in the nineteenth century it was believed that linear markings

on Mars showed channels, as shown in 
Figure 1-7a.As telescopesimproved, scientists realized that there were no such markings, as shown

in Figure 1-7b.
In recent times, again with better instruments, scientists
have found features that suggest Mars once had running and standing

water on its surface, as shown in 
Figure 1-7c.Each new discovery has
raised new questions and areas for exploration.A scientific law
is a rule of nature that sums up related observations to
describe a pattern in nature. For example, the law of conservation of charge

states that in the various changes matter can undergo, the electric charge

before and after stays the same. The law of reflection states that the angle

of incidence for a light beam on a reflective surface equals the angle of

reflection. Notice that the laws do not explain why these phenomena 

happen, they simply describe them.(t)Tom Pantages, (bc)NASA, (others)Photo Researchers

Explain. 1.1Section Review
physicspp.com/self_check_quizGreek philosophers proposed that objects fall because they seek their natural places. The more massive the object, the faster it falls.Galileo showed that the speed at which an object falls depends on the 
amount of time it falls, not on its mass.GalileoÕs statement is true, but Newton revised the reason why objects fall. 

Newton proposed that objects fall because the object and Earth are attracted 
by a force. Newton also stated that there is a force of attraction between any 
two objects with mass.GalileoÕs and NewtonÕs statements still hold true. However, Einstein 

suggested that the force of attraction between two objects is due to mass 
causing the space around it to curve.RevisionRevisionRevisionFigure 1-8
Theories are
changed and modified as newexperiments provide insight and

new observations are made. 
The theory of falling objects has
undergone many revisions.A scientific theoryis an explanation based on many observations sup-
ported by experimental results. Theories may serve as explanations for

laws. A theory is the best available explanation of why things work as they

do. For example, the theory of universal gravitation states that all the mass

in the universe is attracted to other mass. Laws and theories may be revised

or discarded over time, as shown in 
Figure 1-8.Notice that this use of theword 
theoryis different from the common use, as in ÒI have a theory about
why it takes longer to get to school on Fridays.Ó In scientific use, only a very

well-supported explanation is called a theory.

1.2MeasurementFigure 1-9
Drawings of animalsfrom the Lascaux cave in France.
By dating organic material in the
cave, such as pigments and torch

marks, scientists are able to

suggest dates at which these cave

paintings were made. Each date 
is reported with an uncertainty 

to show how precise the
measurement is.When you visit the doctor for a checkup, many measurements are

taken: your height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate. Even
your vision is measured and assigned a number. Blood might be drawn so

measurements can be made of lead or cholesterol levels. Measurements

quantify our observations: a personÕs blood pressure isnÕt just Òpretty

good,Ó itÕs 110/60, the low end of the good range. 
What is a measurement? A measurementis a comparison between an
unknown quantity and a standard. For example, if you measure the mass

of a rolling cart used in an experiment, the unknown quantity is the mass

of the cart and the standard is the gram, as defined by the balance or spring

scale you use. In the Mini Lab in Section 1.1, the length of the spring was

the unknown and the centimeter was the standard.
Comparing Results
As you learned in Section 1.1, scientists share their results. Before new
data are fully accepted, other scientists examine the experiment, looking
for possible sources of error, and try to reproduce the results. Results often 

are reported with an uncertainty. A new measurement that is within the

margin of uncertainty confirms the old measurement. For example, archaeologists use radiocarbon dating to find the age of
cave paintings, such as those from the Lascaux cave, in 
Figure 1-9,and theChauvet cave. Radiocarbon dates are reported with an uncertainty. Three

radiocarbon ages from a panel in the Chauvet cave are 30,940 
610 years,
30,790 
600 years, and 30,230 
530 years. While none of the measure-
ments exactly match, the uncertainties in all three overlap, and the meas-

urements confirm each other.

14.014.515.0Spring length (cm)Student13.7Mini Lab DataabSuppose three students performed the Mini Lab from Section 1.1 several
times, starting with springs of the same length. With two washers on the
spring, student 1 made repeated measurements, which ranged from 

14.4 cm to 14.8 cm. The average of student 1Õs measurements was 14.6 cm,

as shown in 
Figure 1-10.
This result was reported as (14.6
0.2) cm.Student 2 reported finding the springÕs length to be (14.8 
0.3) cm.Student 3 reported a length of (14.0 0.1) cm.Could you conclude that the three measurements are in agreement? Is
student 1Õs result reproducible? The results of students 1 and 2 overlap;

that is, they have the lengths 14.5 cm to 14.8 cm in common. However,

there is no overlap and, therefore, no agreement, between their results and

the result of student 3.Precision Versus Accuracy
Both precision and accuracy are characteristics of measured values. How
precise and accurate are the measurements of the three students? The
degree of exactness of a measurement is called its precision.Student 3Õs
measurements are the most precise, within 
0.1 cm. The measurements ofthe other two students are less precise because they have a larger uncertainty.
Precision depends on the instrument and technique used to make themeasurement. Generally, the device that has the finest division on its scale

produces the most precise measurement. The precision of a measurement
is one-half the smallest division of the instrument. For example, the grad-

uated cylinder in Figure 1-11a
has divisions of 1 mL. You can measure an
object to within 0.5 mL with this device. However, the smallest division on

the beaker in Figure 1-11b
is 50 mL. How precise were your measurements
in the MiniLab?The significant digits in an answer show its precision. A measure of
67.100 g is precise to the nearest thousandth of a gram. Recall from Section

1.1 the rules for performing operations with measurements given to dif-

ferent levels of precision. If you add 1.2 mL of acid to a beaker containing

2.4102mL of water, you cannot say you now have 2.412
102mL offluid, because the volume of water was not measured to the nearest tenth

of a milliliter, but to 100 times that.

Accuracy is
checked by measuring a knownvalue.Accuracy
describes how well the results of a measurement agree with
the ÒrealÓ value; that is, the accepted value as measured by competent
experimenters. If the length of the spring that the three students measured

had been 14.8 cm, then student 2 would have been most accurate and stu-

dent 3 least accurate. How accurate do you think your measurements in the

Mini Lab on page 8 were?What might have led someone to make inaccu-

rate measurements? How could you check the accuracy of measurements?
A common method for checking the accuracy of an instrument is calledthe two-point calibration. First, does the instrument read zero when it

should? Second, does it give the correct reading when it is measuring an

accepted standard, as shown in 
Figure 1-12?Regular checks for accuracy
are performed on critical measuring instruments, such as the radiation 

output of the machines used to treat cancer. 
Techniques of Good Measurement 
To assure accuracy and precision, instruments also have to be used cor-
rectly. Measurements have to be made carefully if they are to be as precise

as the instrument allows. One common source of error comes from the

angle at which an instrument is read. Scales should be read with oneÕs eye

directly above the measure, as shown in 
Figure 1-13a.If the scale is readfrom an angle, as shown in 
Figure 1-13b,
you will get a different, and less
accurate, value. The difference in the readings is caused by 
parallax,
whichis the apparent shift in the position of an object when it is viewed from 

different angles. To experiment with parallax, place your pen on a ruler and

read the scale with your eye directly over the tip, then read the scale with

your head shifted far to one side.
abDistance to the MoonFor
over 25 years, scientists have been
accurately measuring the distance

to the Moon by shining lasers
through telescopes. The laser

beam reflects off reflectors placed

on the surface of the Moon by

Apollo astronauts. They have

determined that the average
distance between the centers of

Earth and the Moon is 385,000 km,

and it is known with an accuracy

of better than one part in 10 billion.

Using this laser technique,
scientists also have discovered

that the Moon is receding from
Earth at about 3.8 cm/yr.

8848 m, 
above sea level. The Global Positioning System, or GPS, offers an illustration of accuracy
and precision in measurement. The GPS consists of 24 satellites with trans-mitters in orbit and numerous receivers on Earth. The satellites send 

signals with the time, measured by highly accurate atomic clocks. The

receiver uses the information from at least four satellites to determine 

latitude, longitude, and elevation. (The clocks in the receivers are not as

accurate as those on the satellites.)
Receivers have different levels of precision. A device in an automobile
might give your position to within a few meters. Devices used by geo-

physicists, as in 
Figure 1-14,can measure movements of millimeters in
EarthÕs crust.
The GPS was developed by the United States Department of Defense. It
uses atomic clocks, developed to test EinsteinÕs theories of relativity and

gravity. The GPS eventually was made available for civilian use. GPS signals

now are provided worldwide free of charge and are used in navigation on

land, at sea, and in the air, for mapping and surveying, by telecommuni-

cations and satellite networks, and for scientific research into earthquakes

and plate tectonics.

16.4Awell-designed graph can convey information quickly and simply.
Patterns that are not immediately evident in a list of numbers take
shape when the data are graphed. In this section, you will develop graph-

ing techniques that will enable you to display, analyze, and model data.
Identifying Variables
When you perform an experiment, it is important to change only one
factor at a time. For example, 
Table 1-3
gives the length of a spring with dif-
ferent masses attached, as measured in the Mini Lab. Only the mass varies;

if different masses were hung from different types of springs, you wouldnÕt

know how much of the difference between two data pairs was due to the

different masses and how much to the different springs.
A variableis any factor that might affect the behavior of an experimental
setup. The independent variable
is the factor that is changed or manipu-lated during the experiment. In this experiment, the mass was the inde-

pendent variable. The 
dependent variable
is the factorthat depends on the independent variable. In this experi-

ment, the amount that the spring stretched depended on
the mass. An experiment might look at how radioactivity

varies with time, how friction changes with weight, 

or how the strength of a magnetic field depends on the 

distance from a magnet. One way to analyze data is to make a line graph. This
shows how the dependent variable changes with the inde-

pendent variable. The data from Table 1-3 are graphed in

black in Figure 1-15. The line in blue, drawn as close to
all the data points as possible, is called a 
line of best fit.The line of best fit is a better model for predictions than
any one point that helps determine the line. The problem-

solving strategy on the next page gives detailed instruc-

tions for graphing data and sketching a line of best fit.3530252015105013.514.0

Scatter plots of data may take many different shapes, suggest-
ing different relationships. (The line of best fit may be called a
curve of best fit for nonlinear graphs.) Three of the most common

relationships will be shown in this section. You probably are

familiar with them from math class.
When the line of best fit is a straight line, as in Figure 1-15, the
dependent variable varies linearly with the independent variable.

There is a linear relationshipbetween the two variables. The
relationship can be written as an equation.Find the y-intercept, b, and the slope, 
m, as illustrated in Figure 1-16.Use points on the lineÑthey may or may not be data points.

Plotting Line Graphs
Use the following steps to plot line graphs from data tables.
1.Identify the independent and dependent variables in your data.
The independent variable is plotted on the horizontal axis, the 

x-axis. The dependent variable is plotted on the vertical axis, 
the y-axis. 2.Determine the range of the independent variable to be plotted. 3.Decide whether the origin (0, 0) is a valid data point. 
4.Spread the data out as much as possible. Let each division on

the graph paper stand for a convenient unit. This usually means

units that are multiples of 2, 5, or 10.
5.Number and label the horizontal axis. The label should include

the units, such as 
Mass (grams).
6.Repeat steps 2Ð5 for the dependent variable. 7.Plot the data points on the graph.
8.Draw the best-fit straight line or smooth curve that passes

through as many data points as possible. This is sometimes

called 
eyeballing. Do not use a series of straight line segments
that connect the dots. The line that looks like the best fit to you

may not be exactly the same as someone elseÕs. There is 

a formal procedure, which many graphing calculators use,

called the least-squares technique, that produces a unique

best-fit line, but that is beyond the scope of this textbook.
9.Give the graph a title that clearly tells what the graph
represents.
Math HandbookGraphs of Relationspages 848Ñ852
015-019 CH01-S3-845813  5/28/04  10:56 AM  Page 16The slope is the ratio of the vertical change to the hor-
izontal change. To find the slope, select two points, 
AandB, far apart on the line. The vertical change, or rise, 
y, isthe difference between the vertical values of 
Aand B. Thehorizontal change, or run, 
x, is the difference between
the horizontal values of 
Aand B. In Figure 1-16:m0.08 cm/gIf ygets smaller as xgets larger, then 
y/xis negative, and
the line slopes downward. 
The y-intercept, b, is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis, and it
is the y-value when the value of 
xis zero. In this example, 
b13.7 cm.When b0, or ymx, the quantity yis said to vary directly with 
x. Nonlinear Relationships
Figure 1-17shows the distance a brass ball falls versus time. Note that
the graph is not a straight line, meaning the relationship is not linear. There
are many types of nonlinear relationships in science. Two of the most com-

mon are the quadratic and inverse relationships
.The graph in Figure 1-17is a quadratic relationship,represented by the following equation.
A computer program or graphing calculator easily can find the values of
the constants a, b, and cin this equation. In this case, the equation is 
d5t2.See the Math Handbook in the back of the book for more on making and
using line graphs.

Figure 1-18
This graph shows
the inverse relationship betweenresistance and current. As

resistance increases, current
decreases.
The graph in Figure 1-18shows how the current in an electric circuit
varies as the resistance is increased. This is an example of an 
inverse 
relationship,represented by the following equation.
The three relationships you have learned about are a sample of the 
simple relations you will most likely try to derive in this course. Many

other mathematical models are used. Important examples include sinu-
soids, used to model cyclical phenomena, and exponential growth and

decay, used to study radioactivity. Combinations of different mathematical

models represent even more complex phenomena.

and how light and shadows fall,among other physics topics.Predicting Values
When scientists discover relations like the ones shown in the graphs in
this section, they use them to make predictions. For example, the equation

for the linear graph in Figure 1-16is as follows:
y(0.08 cm/g)x13.7 cmRelations, either learned as formulas or developed from graphs, can be
used to predict values you havenÕt measured directly. How far would the

spring in Table 1-3 stretch with 49 g of mass? 
y(0.08 cm/g)(49 g)13.7 cm18 cmIt is important to decide how far you can extrapolate from the data you

have. For example, 49 kg is a value far outside the ones measured, and the

spring might break rather than stretch that far. 
Physicists use models to accurately predict how systems will behave:
what circumstances might lead to a solar flare, how changes to a circuit will

change the performance of a device, or how electromagnetic fields will

affect a medical instrument. People in all walks of life use models in many

ways. 
One example is shown in 
Figure 1-19.With the tools you have
learned in this chapter, you can answer questions and produce models for

the physics questions you will encounter in the rest of this textbook.

Computer History and Growth
Computer History and Growth
Each pixelof the animations or movies you
watch, and each letter of the instant messages
you send presents your computer with several

hundred equations. 
Each equation must besolved in a few billionths of a 
secondÑif ittakes a bit longer, you might complain that

your computer is slow. 
Early ComputersThe earliest computerscould solve very complex arrays of equations,

just as yours can, but it took them a lot longer

to do so. There were several reasons for this.

First, the mathematics of algorithms (problem-
solving strategies) still was new. Computer sci-

entists were only beginning to learn how to

arrange a particular problem, such as the con-
version of a picture into an easily-transmittable

form, so that it could be solved by a machine. 
UNIVAC 1, an early computer, filled an entire room.
1.Research
A compression protocol
makes a computer file smaller and 
less prone to transmission errors. Look

up the terms .jpg, .mp3, .mpeg,and .midiand see how they apply to the activities

you do on your computer. 
2.CalculateUsing the example here,how long does it take for a binary 

number to travel 15 m? How many such
operations could there be each second?Going Further
Machine SizeSecond, the machines were
physically large. Computers work by switching
patterns of electric currents that represent binary
numbers. A 16-bit machine works with binary

numbers that are 16 bits long. If a 64-bit num-
ber must be dealt with, the machine must repeat
the same operation four times. A 32-bit machine

would have to repeat the operation only twice,

thus making it that much faster. But a 32-bit

machine is four times the size of a 16-bit
machine; that is, it has four times as many wires

and transistor switches, and even 8-bit machines

were the size of the old UNIVAC shown above. 
Moreover, current travels along wires at
speeds no greater than about two-thirds the
speed of light. This is a long time if the com-
puter wires are 15 m long and must move

information in less than 10
9s. 
MemoryThird, electronic memories were
extremely expensive. You may know that a larger
memory lets your computer work faster. When

one byte of memory required eight circuit

boards, 1024 bytes (or 1 K) of memory was

enormous. Because memory was so precious,

computer programs had to be written with great
cleverness. Astronants got to the Moon with 

64 K of memory in ApolloÕs
on-board computers. 
When Gordon Moore and others invented
the integrated circuit around 1960, the size and
cost of computer circuitry dropped drastically.

Physically smaller, and thus faster, machines

could be built and very large memories became

possible. Today, the transistors on a chip are

now smaller than bacteria. 
The cost and size of computers have dropped
so much that your cell phone has far more

computing power than most big office

machines of the 1970s. 
Processor chips
used in todayÕs
computers are

tiny compared to

the old computer
systems.CORBIS022 CH01-FEATURE-845813  3/30/04  2:34 AM  Page 221.1Mathematics and Physics

will be useful in your study of physics. In this chapter, you will begin
to use these tools to analyze motion. In subsequent chapters, you will

apply them to all kinds of movement using sketches, diagrams, graphs,

and equations. These concepts will help you to determine how fast and

how far an object will move, whether the object is speeding up or slowing

down, and whether it is standing still or moving at a constant speed.

Perceiving motion is instinctiveÑyour eyes naturally pay more attention to

moving objects than to stationary ones. Movement is all around youÑ

from fast trains and speedy skiers to slow breezes and lazy clouds.

Movements travel in many directions, such as the straight-line path of a

bowling ball in a laneÕs gutter, the curved path of a tether ball, the spiral of

a falling kite, and the swirls of water circling a drain.

In this photo, the camera was

All Kinds of MotionWhat comes to your mind when you hear the word 
motion?A speedingautomobile? A spinning ride at an amusement park? A baseball soaringover a fence for a home run? Or a child swinging back and forth in a 

regular rhythm? When an object is in motion, as shown in 
Figure 2-1,its position changes. Its position can change along the path of a straight

line, a circle, an arc, or a back-and-forth vibration.
Some of the types of motion described above appear to be more com-
plicated than others. When beginning a new area of study, it is generally a

good idea to begin with what appears to be the least complicated situation,
learn as much as possible about it, and then gradually add more complex-
ity to that simple model. In the case of motion, you will begin your study

with movement along a straight line.
Movement along a straight line
Suppose that you are reading this text-
book at home. At the beginning of Chapter 2, you glance over at your pet
hamster and see that he is sitting in a corner of his cage. Sometime later,

you look over again, and you see that he now is sitting by the food dish in

the opposite corner of the cage. You can infer that he has moved from one

place to another in the time in between your observations. Thus, a descrip-

tion of motion relates to place and time. You must be able to answer the

questions of where and when an object is positioned to describe its
motion. Next, you will look at some tools that are useful in determining

when an object is at a particular place. 
Motion Diagrams
Consider an example of straight-line motion: a runner is jogging alonga straight path. One way of representing the motion of the runner is to 

create a series of images showing the positions of the runner at equal time

intervals. This can be done by photographing the runner in motion to

obtain a series of images. 
Suppose you point a camera in a direction perpendicular to the direction
of motion, and hold it still while the motion is occurring. Then you take a

series of photographs of the runner at equal time intervals. 
Figure 2-2shows what a series of consecutive images for a runner might look like.

Notice that the runner is in a different position in each image, but every-

thing in the background remains in the same position. This indicates that,
relative to the ground, only the runner is in motion. What is another way

of representing the runnerÕs motion?
Figure 2-2
If you relate the position of the runner to the background in each imageover equal time intervals, you will conclude that she is in motion.(t)Getty Images, (others)Hutchings Photography 030-033 CH02-S1-845813  3/13/04  3:58 AM  Page 32physicspp.com/self_check_quizSuppose that you stacked the images from
Figure 2-2, one on top of the other. 
Figure 2-3shows what such a stacked image might look
like. You will see more than one image of 

the moving runner, but only a single image of

the motionless objects in the background. A
series of images showing the positions of a

moving object at equal time intervals is called

a motion diagram.The Particle Model
Keeping track of the motion of the runner 
is easier if you disregard the movement of 

the arms and legs, and instead concentrate on

a single point at the center of her body. In

effect, you can disregard the fact that she has

some size and imagine that she is a very small

object located precisely at that central point. A
particle modelis a simplified version of a motion diagram in which the
object in motion is replaced by a series of single points. To use the particle

model, the size of the object must be much less than the distance it 
moves. The internal motions of the object, such as the waving of the run-

nerÕs arms are ignored in the particle model. In the photographic motion

diagram, you could identify one central point on the runner, such as a dot

centered at her waistline, and take measurements of the position of the

dot. The bottom part of Figure 2-3 shows the particle model for the 

runnerÕs motion. You can see that applying the particle model produces a

simplified version of the motion diagram. In the next section, you will

learn how to create and use a motion diagram that shows how far an object

moved and how much time it took to move that far.

motion diagrams for two runners in a race, when the
first runner crosses the finish line as the other runner

is three-fourths of the way to the finish line. 
Figure 2-3
Stacking a series 
of images taken at regular time
intervals and combining them

model of her motion.2.1Section Review

In these motion
diagrams, the origin is at the left(a),and the positive values of
distance extend horizontally to the

right. The two arrows, drawn from

the origin to points representing
the runner, locate his position at

two different times 
(b).Would it be possible to take measurements of distance and time
froma 
motion diagram, such as the motion diagram of the runner?Before taking the photographs, you could place a meterstick or a measur-

ing tape on the ground along the path of the runner. The measuring 

tape would tell you where the runner was in each image. A stopwatch or

clock within the view of the camera could tell the time. But where should

you place the end of the measuring tape? When should you start the 

stopwatch?
Coordinate Systems
When you decide where to place the measuring tape and when to start
the stopwatch, you are defining a 
coordinate system,
which tells you the
location of the zero point of the variable you are studying and the direc-

tion in which the values of the variable increase. The 
originis the point atwhich both variables have the value zero. In the example of the runner, the

origin, represented by the zero end of the measuring tape, could be placed

6 m to the left of the tree. The motion is in a straight line; thus, your meas-

uring tape should lie along that straight line. The straight line is an axis of

the coordinate system. You probably would place the tape so that the

meter scale increases to the right of the zero, but putting it in the opposite
direction is equally correct. In Figure 2-6a,the origin of the coordinatesystem is on the left.
You can indicate how far away the runner is from the origin at a partic-
ular time on the simplified motion diagram by drawing an arrow from the

origin to the point representing the runner, as shown in 
Figure 2-6b. 
Thisarrow represents the runnerÕs 
position,the separation between an object
and the origin. The length of the arrow indicates how far the object is 

from the origin, or the objectÕs 
distancefrom the origin. The arrow points
from the origin to the location of the moving object at a particular time.

Add two vectors by placing them tip to tail. The
resultant points from the tail of

the first vector to the tip of the

Is there such a thing as a negative position? Suppose you chose the coor-
dinate system just described, placing the origin 4 m left of the tree with the

d-axis extending in a positive direction to the right. A position 9 m to the
left of the tree, 5 m left of the origin, would be a negative position, as

shown in 
Figure 2-7.In the same way, you could discuss a time before the
stopwatch was started.
Vectors and scalars
Quantities that have both size, also called 
magni-tude,
and direction, are called vectors,
and can be represented by arrows.
Quantities that are just numbers without any direction, such as distance,

time, or temperature, are called 
scalars.
This textbook will use boldfaceletters to represent vector quantities and regular letters to represent scalars.
You already know how to add scalars; for example, 0.6
0.20.8.How do you add vectors? Think about how you would solve the following

problem. Your aunt asks you to get her some cold medicine at the 

store nearby. You walk 0.5 km east from your house to the store, buy the

cold medicine, and then walk another 0.2 km east to your auntÕs house.

How far from the origin are you at the end of your trip? The answer, of

course, is 0.5 km east 
0.2 km east0.7 km east. You also could solve
this problem graphically, using the following method. 
Using a ruler, measure and draw each vector. The length of a vector should
be proportional to the magnitude of the quantity being represented, so you

must decide on a scale for your drawing. For example, you might let 1 cm

on paper represent 0.1 km. The important thing is to choose a scale that
produces a diagram of reasonable size with a vector that is about 5Ð10 cm

long. The vectors representing the two segments that made up your trip to

your auntÕs house are shown in 
Figure 2-8,drawn to a scale of 
1 cm, which represents 0.1 km. The vector that represents the total of these

two, shown here with a dotted line, is 7 cm long. According to the estab-

lished scale, you were 0.7 km from the origin at the end of your trip. 

The vector that represents the sum of the other two vectors is called the

resultant.The resultant always points from the tail of the first vector to the
tip of the last vector.

2 indicates both the direction and

amount of displacement duringthis time interval.Time Intervals and Displacements
When analyzing the runnerÕs motion, you might want to know how
long it took the runner to travel from the tree to the lamppost. This value

is obtained by finding the difference in the stopwatch readings at each

position. Assign the symbol 
tito the time when the runner was at the tree
and the symbol 
tfto the time when he was at the lamppost. The difference
between two times is called a 
time interval.
A common symbol for a time
interval is 
t, where the Greek letter delta, , is used to represent a changein a quantity. The time interval is defined mathematically as follows. 
Although i and f are used to represent the initial and final times, they can
be the initial and final times of any time interval you choose. In the example

of the runner, the time it takes for him to go from the tree to the lamppost

is tfti5.0 s1.0 s4.0 s. How did the runnerÕs position change 
when he 
ran from the tree to the lamppost, as shown in 
Figure 2-9?Thesymbol 
dmay be used to represent position. In common speech, a posi-
tion refers to a place; but in physics, a position is a vector with its tail at

the origin of a coordinate system and its tip at the place. 
Figure 2-9 shows 
d, an arrow drawn from the runnerÕs position at the
tree to his position at the lamppost. This vector represents his change 

in position, or displacement,during the time interval between 
tiand tf.The length of the arrow represents the distance the runner moved, while

the direction the arrow points indicates the direction of the displacement.

Displacement is mathematically defined as follows.
Again, the initial and final positions are the beginning and end of any
interval you choose. Also, while position can be considered a vector, it is

common practice when doing calculations to drop the boldface, and use

signs and magnitudes. This is because position usually is measured from

the origin, and direction typically is included with the position indication.DisplacementddfdiDisplacement is equal to the final position minus the initial position.Time Interval
ttftiThe time interval is equal to the final time minus the initial time.

B, which is 1 cm long pointing west. Figure 2-10b shows the
resultant of Aand B. It is 3 cm long pointing east.To determine the length and direction of the displacement vector,
ddfdi, draw 
di, which is direversed. Then draw 
dfand copy 
diwith its tail at dfÕs tip. Add 
dfand di. In the example of the runner, his
displacement is df di25.0 m5.0 m20.0 m. He moved to the
right of the tree. To completely describe an objectÕs displacement, 
you must indicate the distance it traveled and the direction it moved. Thus,

displacement, a vector, is not identical to distance, a scalar; it is distance

and direction.What would happen if you chose a different coordinate system; that is,
if you measured the position of the runner from another location? Look at

Figure 2-9, and suppose you change the right side of the 
d-axis to be zero.While the vectors drawn to represent each position change, the length and

direction of the displacement vector does not, as shown in 
Figures 2-11a
and b.The displacement, d, in the time interval from 1.0 s to 5.0 s does
not change. Because displacement is the same in any coordinate system,

you frequently will use displacement when studying the motion of an

object. The displacement vector is always drawn with its flat end, or tail, at

the earlier position, and its point, or tip, at the later position. Figure 2-11

with its origin at the grocery store and the direction

the car is moving in as the positive direction. Your

motion of an object in a variety of w
ays. As you have 
seen, a motion diagram contains useful information about an objectÕs position at various

times and can be helpful in determining the displacement of an object
during time intervals. Graphs of the objectÕs position and time also contain

this information.Review Figure 2-9, the motion diagram for the runner with a location to
the left of the tree chosen as the origin. From this motion diagram, you can

organize the times and corresponding positions of the runner, as in 
Table
2-1.Using a Graph to Find Out Where and When
The data from Table 2-1
can be presented by plotting the time data on
a horizontal axis and the position data on a vertical axis, which is called a

position-time graph.The graph of the runnerÕs motion is shown in
Figure 2-12.To draw this graph, first plot the runnerÕs recorded positions.
Then, draw a line that best fits the recorded points. Notice that this graph

is not a picture of the path taken by the runner as he was movingÑthe

graphed line is sloped, but the path that he ran was flat. The line represents

the most likely positions of the runner at the times between the recorded

data points. (Recall from Chapter 1 that this line often is referred to as a

best-fit line.) This means that even though 
there is nodata point to tell you
exactly when the runner was 30.0 m bey
ond his starting point or where hewas at 
t4.5 s, you can use the graph to estimate his position. The follow-
ing example problem shows how. Note that before estimating the runnerÕs

position, the questions first are restated in the language of physics in terms
of positions and times.

1.Draw position-time graphs for each person.2.At what time will the three exercise enthusiasts be within the smallest distance
interval?3.What is the length of that distance interval?
How long did the runner spend at any location? Each position has been
linked to a time, but how long did that time last? You could say Òan
instant,Ó but how long is that? If an instant lasts for any finite amount of

time, then the runner would have stayed at the same position during that

time, and he would not have been moving. However, as he was moving, an

instant is not a finite period of time. This means that an instant of time

lasts zero seconds. The symbol 
drepresents the instantaneous positionof the runnerÑthe position at a particular instant.Equivalent representations
As shown in 
Figure 2-15,you now have sev-
eral different ways to describe motion: words, pictures (or pictorial repre-
sentations), motion diagrams, data tables, and position-time graphs. All of

these representations are equivalent. That is, they can all contain the same

information about the runnerÕs motion. However, depending on what you

want to find out about an objectÕs motion, some of the representations

will be more useful than others. In the pages that follow, you will get some

practice constructing these equivalent representations and learning which

ones are the easiest to use in solving different kinds of problems.
Considering the motion of multiple objectsA position-time graph for two
different runners in a race is shown in Example Problem 2. When and where
does one runner pass the other? First, you need to restate this question in

physics terms: At what time do the two objects have the same position? You

can evaluate this question by identifying the point on the position-time

graph at which the lines representing the two objects intersect.

on a position-time graph. The intersection of two lines tells you when the
two objects have the same position. Does this mean that they will collide?

Not necessarily. For example, if the two objects are runners and if they are

in different lanes, they will not collide. Later in this textbook, you will

learn to represent motion in two dimensions. 
Is there anything else that you can learn from a position-time graph? Do
you know what the slope of a line means? In the next section, you will use

the slope of a line on a position-time graph to determine the velocity of an

object. What about the area under a plotted line? In Chapter 3, you will

draw other graphs and learn to interpret the areas under the plotted lines.

In later chapters you will continue to refine your skills with creating and

interpreting graphs.

movement. How can you measure how fast it is moving? With devices
such as a 
meterstick and a stopwatch, you can measure position and time.
Can this information be used to describe the rate of motion?Velocity
Suppose you recorded two joggers on one motion diagram, as shown in
Figure 2-20a. 
From one frame to the next you can see that the position 
of the jogger in red shorts changes more than that of the one wearing blue.

In other words, for a fixed time interval, the displacement, 
d, is greaterfor the jogger in red because she is moving faster. She covers a larger dis-

tance than the jogger in blue does in the same amount of time. Now, sup-

pose that each jogger travels 100.0 m. The time interval, 
t, would be
smaller for the jogger in red than for the one in blue.
Average velocity
From the example of the joggers, you can see that both
the displacement, d, and time interval, 
t, might be needed to create thequantity that tells how fast an object is moving. How might they be com-
bined? Compare the lines representing the red and blue joggers in theposition-time graphs in Figure 2-20b.
The slope of the red joggerÕs line is
steeper than the slope of the blue joggerÕs line. A steeper slope indicates a

greater change in displacement during each time interval.
Recall from Chapter 1 that to find the slope, you first choose two points
on the line. Next, you subtract the vertical coordinate (
din this case) of thefirst point from the vertical coordinate of the second point to obtain the

rise of the line. After that, you subtract the horizontal coordinate (
tin thiscase) of the first point from the horizontal coordinate of the second point
to obtain the run. Finally, you divide the rise by the run to obtain the slope.

The slopes of the two lines shown in Figure 2-20b are found as follows:

The points used to calculate the

slope of each line are shown (b). Hutchings Photography 043-047 CH02-S4-845813  5/28/04  1:12 PM  Page 43There are some important things to notice about this comparison. First,the slope of the faster runner is a greater number, so it is reasonable to
assume that this number might be connected with the runnerÕs speed.

Second, look at the units of the slope, meters per second. In other words,

the slope tells how many meters the runner moved in 1 s. These units are

similar to miles per hour, which also measure speed. Looking at how 

the slope is calculated, you can see that slope is the change in position,

divided by the time interval during which that change took place, or 

(dfdi) / (tfti), or d/t. When d gets larger, the slope gets larger;
when tgets larger, the slope gets smaller. This agrees with the interpreta-
tion above of the movements of the red and blue joggers. The slope of 

a position-time graph for an object is the objectÕs 
average velocity
and is represented by the ratio of the change of position to the time interval

during which the change occurred.The symbol 
means that the left-hand side of the equation is defined by
the right-hand side.
It is a common misconception to say that the slope of a position-time
graph gives the speed of the object. Consider the slope of the position-time
graph shown in 
Figure 2-21.
The slope of this position-time graph is 5.0 m/s. As you can see the slope indicates both the magnitude and
direction. Recall that average velocity is a quantity that has both magnitude

and direction. The slope of a position-time graph indicates the average

velocity of the object and not its speed. Take another look at Figure 2-21.

The slope of the graph is 5.0 m/s and thus, the object has a velocity of 
5.0 m/s. The object starts out at a positive position and moves toward the
origin. It moves in the negative direction at a rate of 5.0 m/s. 
Average speed
The absolute value of the slope of a position-time graph
tells you the 
average speed
of the object; that is, how fast the object is mov-
ing. The sign of the slope tells you in what direction the object is moving.
The combination of an objectÕs average speed, 
v, and the direction in whichit is moving is the average velocity, 
v. Thus, for the object represented in
Figure 2-21, the average velocity is 
5.0 m/s, or 5.0 m/s
in the negative 
direction. Its average speed is 5.0 m/s.
Remember that if an object moves in the negative direc-

tion, then its displacement is negative. This means that

the objectÕs velocity always will have the same sign as

the objectÕs displacement.
As you consider other types of motion to analyze in
future chapters, sometimes the velocity will be the

important quantity to consider, while at other times,

the speed will be the important quantity. Therefore, it

is a good idea to make sure that you understand the

differences between velocity and speed so that you will

be sure to use the right one later.

Why is the quantity 
d/tcalled average velocity? Why isnÕt it called
velocity? Think about how a motion diagram is constructed. A motion
diagram shows the position of a moving object at the beginning and end

of a time interval. It does not, however, indicate what happened within

that time interval. During the time interval, the speed of the object could

have remained the same, increased, or decreased. The object may have

stopped or even changed direction. All that can be determined from the

motion diagram is an average velocity, which is found by dividing the total

displacement by the time interval in which it took place. The speed and

direction of an object at a particular instant is called the instantaneousvelocity.
In this textbook, the term velocitywill refer to instantaneousvelocity, represented by the symbol 
v.Average Velocity on Motion Diagrams
How can you show average velocity on a motion diagram? Although the
average velocity is in the same direction as displacement, the two quantities
are not measured using the same units. Nevertheless, they are propor-

tionalÑwhen displacement is greater during a given time interval, so is 

average velocity. A motion diagram is not a precise graph of average velocity,

but you can indicate the direction and magnitude of the average velocity on

it. Imagine two cars driving down the road at different speeds. A video

camera records their motions at the rate of one frame every second.

Imagine that each car has a paintbrush attached to it that automatically
descends and paints a line on the ground for half a second every second.

The faster car would paint a longer line on the ground. The vectors 

you draw on a motion diagram to represent the velocity are like the lines

made by the paintbrushes on the ground below the cars. Red is used 

to indicate velocity vectors on motion diagrams. 
Figure 2-24shows the
particle models, complete with velocity vectors, for two cars: one moving

to the right and the other moving more slowly to the left.
Using equationsAny time you graph a straight line, you can find an equa-
tion to describe it. There will be many cases for which it will be more 
efficient to use such an equation instead of a graph to solve problems. Take
another look at the graph in Figure 2-21 on page 44 for the object moving

with a constant velocity of 
5.0 m/s. Recall from Chapter 1 that any
straight line can be represented by the formula: 
ymxb where yis thequantity plotted on the vertical axis, 
mis the slope of the line, 
xis thequantity plotted on the horizontal axis, and 
bis the y-intercept of the line.
For the graph in Figure 2-21, the quantity plotted on the vertical axis is
position, and the variable used to represent position is 
d. The slope of the line is 5.0 m/s, which is the objectÕs average velocity, 
v. The quantityplotted on the horizontal axis is time, 
t. The y-intercept is 20.0 m. What
does this 20.0 m represent? By inspecting the graph and thinking about
how the object moves, you can figure out that the object was at a position

of 20.0 mwhen 
t0.0 s. This is called the initial position of the object,
and is designated di. Table 2-2
summarizes how the general variables in
the straight-line formula are changed to the specific variables you have

been using to describe motion. It also shows the numerical values for the

two constants in this equation.

Average velocity
vectors have the same direction as
their corresponding displacement

vectors. Their lengths are different,

but proportional, and they have

different units because they 

are obtained by dividing the
displacement by the time interval.043-047 CH02-S4-845813  5/28/04  1:17 PM  Page 46Based on the information shown inTable 2-2, the equation 
ymxbbecomes dvtdi, or, by inserting the values of the constants, 
d(5.0 m/s)t20.0 m. This equation describes the motion that is 
represented in Figure 2-21. You can check this by plugging a value of 
tintothe equation and seeing that you obtain the same value of 
das when you
read it directly from the graph. To conduct an extra check to be sure the
equation makes sense, take a look at the units. You cannot set two items

with different units equal to each other in an equation. In this equation,
the left-hand side is a position, so its units are meters. The first term on the

right-hand side multiplies meters per second times seconds, so its units are

also meters. The last term is in meters, too, so the units on this equation

are valid.
This equation gives you another way to represent the motion of an object.
Note that once a coordinate system is chosen, the direction of 
dis specified by positive and negative values, and the boldface notation can be

dispensed with, as in Òd-axis.Ó However, the boldface notation for velocity
will be retained to avoid confusing it with speed. 
Your toolbox of representations now includes words, motion diagrams,
pictures, data tables, position-time graphs, and an equation. You should be

able to use any one of these representations to generate at least the char-

acteristics of the others. You will get more practice with this in the rest of

this chapter and also in Chapter 3 as you apply these representations to

help you solve problems.

gram consists of a series of images showing the positions of a moving object at

equal time intervals. Motion diagrams help describe the motion of an object. 

By looking at a motion diagram you can determine whether an object is speeding

up, slowing down, or moving at constant speed.

What time is it really?You might use a
clock to find out what time it is at any
moment. A clock is a device that counts regu-
larly recurring events in order to measure time.

Suppose the clock in your classroom reads

9:00. Your watch, however, reads 8:55, and your

friendÕs watch reads 9:02. So

what time is it, really? Which
clock or watch is accurate? 
Many automated processes
are controlled by clocks. For

example, an automated bell 

that signals the end of a class
period is controlled by a clock.

Thus, if you wanted to be on

time for a class you would have

to synchronize your watch to

the one controlling the bell.
Other processes, such as GPS

navigation, space travel, internet

synchronization, transportation,

and communication, rely on
clocks with extreme precision
and accuracy. A reliable standard clock that

can measure when exactly one second has
elapsed is needed.The Standard Cesium Clock
Atomic
clocks, such as cesium clocks, address this

need. Atomic clocks measure the number of

times the atom used in the clock switches 
its energy state. Such oscillations in an atomÕs

energy occur very quickly and regularly. 

The National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) currently uses the oscilla-

tions of the cesium atom to determine the
standard 1-s interval. One second is defined 

as the duration of 9,192,631,770 oscillations 

of the cesium atom. The cesium atom has a single electron in itsoutermost energy level. This outer electron

spins and behaves like a miniature magnet.

The cesium nucleus also spins and acts like a
miniature magnet. The nucleus and electron
may spin in such a manner that their north

magnetic poles are aligned. The nucleus and
electron also may spin in a way that causes

opposite poles to be aligned. If the poles arealigned, the cesium atom is in one energy state.

If they are oppositely aligned, the atom is in
another energy state. A microwave with a par-

ticular frequency can strike a cesium atom and
cause the outside spinning electron to switch
its magnetic pole orientation and change the
atomÕs energy state. As a result, the atom emits

light. This occurs at cesiumÕs natural frequency

of 9,192,631,770 cycles/s. This principle was

used to design the cesium clock. How Does the Cesium Clock Work?
Thecesium clock consists of cesium atoms and 
a quartz crystal oscillator, which produces

microwaves. When the oscillatorÕs micro
wavesignal precisely equals cesiumÕs natural fre-

quency, a large number of cesium atoms will

change their energy state. CesiumÕs natural 

frequency is equal to 9,192,631,770 micro
wavecycles. Thus, there are 9,192,631,770 cesium

energy level changes in 1 s. Cesium clocks are

so accurate that a modern cesium clock is off
by less than 1 s in 20 million years.

¥A motion diagram shows the position of an object at successive times. 
¥In the particle model, the object in the motion diagram is replaced by a
series of single points. 
Key Concepts
¥You can define any coordinate system you wish in describing motion, but

some are more useful than others. 
¥A time interval is the difference between two times.
¥A vector drawn from the origin of the coordinate system to the object

indicates the objectÕs position. 
¥Change in position is displacement, which has both magnitude and
direction.¥The length of the displacement vector represents how far the object was

displaced, and the vector points in the direction of the displacement.

¥The slope of an objectÕs position-time graph is the average velocity of the

objectÕs motion.
¥The average speed is the absolute value of the average velocity.

¥You will develop descriptions
of accelerated motion.¥You will use graphs and
equations to solve problemsinvolving moving objects.
¥You will describe the

Objects do not always 

move at constant velocities.

Understanding accelerated

motion will help you better

many objects.
Acceleration
Cars, planes,
subways, elevators, andother common forms of
transportation often begin

their journeys by speeding
up quickly, and end by

stopping rapidly.
Think About This 
The driver of a dragster 
on the starting line waits
for the green light to signal the start of the 
race. At the signal, the driver will step on the gaspedal and try to speed up as quickly as possible. As the car speeds up, how 
will its position change?

Uniform motion is one of the simplest kinds of motion. You learned

in Chapter 2 that an object in uniform motion moves along a
straight line with an unchanging velocity. From your own experiences, you

know, however, that few objects move in this manner all of the time. In this

chapter, you will expand your knowledge of motion by considering a

slightly more complicated type of motion. You will be presented with 

situations in which the velocity of an object changes, while the objectÕs

motion is still along a straight line. Examples of objects and situations you

will encounter in this 
chapter include automobiles that are speeding up,drivers applying brakes, falling objects, and objects thrown straight

upward. In Chapter 6, you will continue to add to your knowledge of

motion by analyzing some common types of motion that are not confined

to a straight line. These include motion along a circular path and the

motion of thrown objects, such as baseballs.

Figure 3-1
By noting thedistance the jogger moves in
equal time intervals, you can

determine that the jogger is
standing still 
(a),moving at aconstant speed 
(b),speeding up (c),and slowing down (d).Changing Velocity
You can feel a difference between uniform and nonuniform motion.
Uniform motion feels smooth. You could close your eyes and it would feel

as though you were not moving at all. In contrast, when you move along

a curve or up and down a roller coaster, you feel pushed or pulled.
Consider the motion diagrams shown in 
Figure 3-1.How would you
describe the motion of the person in each case? In one diagram, the 
person is motionless. In another, she is moving at a constant speed. In a

third, she is speeding up, and in a fourth, she is slowing down. How do

you know which one is which? What information do the motion diagrams

contain that could be used to make these distinctions?The most important thing to notice in these motion diagrams is the distance between successive positions. You learned in Chapter 2 that

motionless objects in the background of motion diagrams do not change
positions. Therefore, because there is only one image of the person 

in Figure 3-1a,you can conclude that she is not moving; she is at rest.
Figure 3-1bis like the constant-velocity motion diagrams in Chapter 2.
The distances between images are the same, so the jogger is moving at a

constant speed. The distance between successive positions changes in the

two remaining diagrams. If the change in position gets larger, the jogger is

speeding up, as shown in 
Figure 3-1c.If the change in position getssmaller, as in 
Figure 3-1d,the jogger is slowing down. 
What does a particle-model motion diagram look like for an object withchanging velocity? 
Figure 3-2shows the particle-model motion diagrams
below the motion diagrams of the jogger speeding up and slowing down.

There are two major indicators of the change in velocity in this form of the

motion diagram. The change in the spacing of the dots and the differences
in the lengths of the velocity vectors indicate the changes in velocity. If an

object speeds up, each subsequent velocity vector is longer. If the object

slows down, each vector is shorter than the previous one. Both types of

motion diagrams give an idea of how an objectÕs velocity is changing. 
Velocity-Time Graphs
Just as it was useful to graph a changing position versus time, it also is
useful to plot an objectÕs velocity versus time, which is called a 
velocity-
time, 
orv-tgraph.Table 3-1
on the next page shows the data for a car
that starts at rest and speeds up along a straight stretch of road.acbdA Steel Ball Race

The particle-model
version of the motion diagramindicates the runnerÕs changing

velocity not only by the change 
in spacing of the position dots,

but also by the change in lengthof the velocity vectors.Figure 3-3
The slope of a
velocity-time graph is the
acceleration of the object
represented.
The velocity-time graph obtained by plotting these data points is shown
in Figure 3-3.The positive direction has been chosen to be the same as
that of the motion of the car. Notice that this graph is a straight line, which

means that the car was speeding up at a constant rate. The rate at which 

the carÕs velocity is changing can be found by calculating the slope of the

velocity-time graph.
The graph shows that the slope is (10.0 m/s)/(2.00 s), or 5.00 m/s
2. Thismeans that every second, the velocity of the car increased by 5.00 m/s.

Consider a pair of data points that are separated by 1 s, such as 4.00 s and

5.00 s. At 4.00 s, the car was moving at a velocity of 20.0 m/s. At 5.00 s, 

the car was traveling at 25.0 m/s. Thus, the carÕs velocity increased by 

5.00 m/s in 1.00 s. The rate at which an objectÕs velocity changes is called

the accelerationof the object. When the velocity of an object changes at
a constant rate, it has a constant acceleration. 
Average and Instantaneous Acceleration
The average acceleration
of an object is the change in velocity during
some measurable time interval divided by that time interval. Average accel-

eration is measured in m/s2. The change in velocity at an instant of time is
called instantaneous acceleration.The instantaneous acceleration of anobject can be found by drawing a tangent line on the velocity-time graph

at the point of time in which you are interested. The slope of this line is

equal to the instantaneous acceleration. Most of the situations considered
in this textbook involve motion with acceleration in which the average and

instantaneous accelerations are equal. Table 3-1

In the first and third situations when theobject is speeding up, the velocity and accel-
eration vectors point in the same direction in

each case, as shown in Figure 3-7b. In the

other two situations in which the accelera-

tion vector is in the opposite direction from

the velocity vectors, the object is slowing

down. In other words, when the objectÕs

acceleration is in the same direction as its
velocity, the objectÕs speed increases. When

they are in opposite directions, the speed
decreases. Both the direction of an objectÕs

velocity and its direction of acceleration are

needed to determine whether it is speeding up
or slowing down. An 
object has a positive
acceleration when the acceleration vector
points in the positive direction and a negative acceleration, when the accel-

eration vector points in the negative dir
ection. The sign of acceleration does
not indicate whether the object is speeding up or slowing down.
Determining Acceleration from a 
v-tGraph
Velocity and acceleration information also is contained in velocity-time
graphs. Graphs A, B, C, D, and E, shown in 
Figure 3-8,represent themotions of five different runners. Assume that the positive direction has

been chosen to be east. The slopes of Graphs A and E are zero. Thus, the

accelerations are zero. Both Graphs A and E show motion at a constant

velocityÑGraph A to the east and Graph E to the west. Graph B shows

motion with a positive velocity. The slope of this graph indicates a con-

stant, positive acceleration. You also can infer from Graph B that the speed

increased because it shows positive velocity and acceleration. Graph C has

a negative slope. Graph C shows motion that begins with a positive veloc-

ity, slows down, and then stops. This means that the acceleration and

velocity are in opposite directions. The point at which Graphs C and B

cross shows that the runnersÕ velocities are equal at that point. It does not,

however, give any information about the runnersÕ positions.
Graph D indicates movement that starts out toward the west, slows
down, and for an instant gets to zero velocity, and then moves east with

increasing speed. The slope of Graph D is positive. Because the velocity

and acceleration are in opposite directions, the speed decreases and equals

zero at the time the graph crosses the axis. After that time, the velocity and

acceleration are in the same direction and the speed increases. 
Calculating acceleration

cally? The following equation

Rohith has been jogging to the bus stop for 2.0 min at 3.5 m/s when he looks at his

There are several parallels between acceleration and velocity. Both are

velocity is the time rate of change of position. Both acceleration and veloc-

ity have average and instantaneous forms. You will learn later in this chap-

ter that the area under a velocity-time graph is equal to the objectÕs

displacement and that the area under an acceleration-time graph is equal
to the objectÕs velocity.

You have learned that the definition of average velocity can be alge-
braically rearranged to show the new position after a period of time,
given the initial position and the average velocity. The definition of average

acceleration can be manipulated similarly to show the new velocity after a

period of time, given the initial velocity and the average acceleration.
Velocity with Average Acceleration
If you know an objectÕs average acceleration during a time interval, you
can use it to determine how much the velocity changed during that time.

The definition of average acceleration,
avt, can be rewritten as follows:
vatvfviatThe equation for final velocity with average acceleration can be written 

as follows. 
In cases in which the acceleration is constant, the average acceleration,
a, is the same as the instantaneous acceleration, a. This equation can berearranged to find the time at which an object with constant acceleration
has a given velocity. It also can be used to calculate the initial velocity of an

object when both the velocity and the time at which it occurred are given. 
Final Velocity with Average Acceleration
vfviatThe final velocity is equal to the initial velocity plus the product of the
average acceleration and time interval.065-071 CH03-S2-845813  5/28/04  2:43 PM  Page 6566Chapter 3Accelerated Motion

tvabPosition with Constant Acceleration
You have learned that an object experiencing constant acceleration
changes its velocity at a constant rate. How does the position of an object
with constant acceleration change? The position data at different time
intervals for a car with constant acceleration are shown in 
Table 3-2.
The data from Table 3-2 are graphed in 
Figure 3-9.The graph shows
that the carÕs motion is not uniform: the displacements for equal time

intervals on the graph get larger and larger. Notice that the slope of the line

in Figure 3-9 gets steeper as time goes on. The slopes from the position-
time graph can be used to create a velocity-time graph. Note that the slopes

shown in Figure 3-9 are the same as the velocities graphed in 
Figure 3-10a. 
A unique position-time graph cannot be created using a velocity-time
graph because it does not contain any information about the objectÕs posi-

tion. However, the velocity-time graph does contain information about 

the objectÕs displacement. Recall that for an object moving at a constant 

velocity, 
vvd/t, so dvt. On the graph in Figure 3-10b,
vis the height of the plotted line above the 
t-axis, while 
tis the width of the shaded rectangle. The area of the rectangle, then, is 
vt, or d. Thus, the
area under the v-tgraph is equal to the objectÕs displacement.

The slopes of the 
p-tgraph in Figure 3-9 are thevalues of the corresponding 
v-tgraph (a).For any 
v-tgraph, the displacement during a given
time interval is the area under 
the graph (b).Figure 3-9

A dragster driver tries to obtain maximum
acceleration over a 402-m

(quarter-mile) course. The fastest

time on record for the 402-m

course is 4.480 s. The highest final

speed on record is 147.63 m/s

(330.23 mph).
The area under the v-tgraph is equal to the objectÕs displacement.
Consider the v-tgraph in Figure 3-13for an object moving with constant
acceleration that started with an initial velocity of 
vi. What is the objectÕs
displacement? The area under the graph can be calculated by dividing 

it into a rectangle and a triangle. The area of the rectangle can be found 

by 
drectanglevit, and the area of the triangle can be found by 
dtriangle12vt. Because average acceleration, 
a, is equal to v/t, vcan be rewritten as at. Substituting vatinto the equation for the triangleÕs 
area yields dtriangle12(at)t, or1

ing problems dealing with motion in one dimension: motion diagrams,

to decide which tools are most appropriate in solving a given problem. In

the following section, you will practice using these tools to investigate the

motion of falling objects.
065-071 CH03-S2-845813  3/21/04  8:14 PM  Page 71Drop a sheet of paper. Crumple it, and then drop it again. Drop a rock
or a pebble. How do the three motions compare with each other?
Do heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones? A light, spread-out object,

such as a smooth sheet of paper or a feather, does not fall in the same man-

ner as something more compact, such as a pebble. Why? As an object falls,

it bumps into particles in the air. For an object such as a feather, these little

collisions have a greater effect than they do on pebbles or rocks. To under-

stand the behavior of falling objects, first consider the simplest case: an

object such as a rock, for which the air does not have an appreciable effect

on its motion. The term used to describe the motion of such objects is freefall,which is the motion of a body when air resistance is negligible andthe action can be considered due to gravity alone.
Acceleration Due to Gravity
About 400 years ago, Galileo Galilei recognized that to make progress
in the study of the motion of falling objects, the effects of the substance

through which the object falls have to be ignored. At that time, Galileo had

no means of taking position or velocity data for falling objects, so he rolled

balls down inclined planes. By ÒdilutingÓ gravity in this way, he could

make careful measurements even with simple instruments.
Galileo concluded that, neglecting the effect of the air, all objects in free
fall had the same acceleration. It didnÕt matter what they were made of, how

much they weighed, what height they were dropped from, or whether they

were dropped or thrown. The acceleration of falling objects, given a special

symbol, 
g, is equal to 9.80 m/s2. It is now known that there are small vari-
ations in gat different places on Earth, and that 9.80 m/s2is the average value.
The acceleration due to gravity
is the acceleration of an object in freefall that results from the influence of EarthÕs gravity. Suppose you drop a

rock. After 1 s, its velocity is 9.80 m/s downward, and 1 s after that, its

velocity is 19.60 m/s downward. For each second that the rock is falling,

its downward velocity increases by 9.80 m/s. Note that 
gis a positive num-
ber. When analyzing free fall, whether you treat the acceleration as positive

or negative depends upon the coordinate system that you use. If your coor-

dinate system defines upward to be the positive direction, then the accel-

eration due to gravity is equal to 
g; if you decide that downward is the
positive direction, then the acceleration due to gravity is 
g.A strobe photo of a dropped egg is shown in 
Figure 3-14.The timeinterval between the images is 0.06s. The displacement between each pair

of images increases, so the speed is increasing. If the upward direction is

chosen as positive, then the velocity is becoming more and more negative. 
Ball thrown upward
Instead of a dropped egg, could this photo also illus-trate a ball thrown upward? If upward is chosen to be the positive direc-
tion, then the ball leaves the hand with a positive velocity of, for example,

20.0 m/s. The acceleration is downward, so 
ais negative. That is, 
ag9.80 m/s2. Because the velocity and acceleration are in opposite directions,
the speed of the ball decreases, which is in agreement with the strobe photo.

73After 1 s, the ballÕs velocity is reduced by 9.80 m/s, so it now is traveling
at 10.2 m/s. After 2 s, the velocity is 0.4 m/s, and the ball still is moving
upward. What happens during the next second? The ballÕs velocity is

reduced by another 9.80 m/s, and is equal to 
9.4 m/s. The ball now is
moving downward. After 4 s, the velocity is 
19.2 m/s, meaning that the
ball is falling even faster. 
Figure 3-15ashows the velocity-time graph for
the ball as it goes up and comes back down. At around 2 s, the velocity

changes smoothly from positive to negative. 
Figure 3-15bshows a closer
view of the v-tgraph around that point. At an instant of time, near 2.04 s,
the ballÕs velocity is zero. Look at the position-time graphs in 
Figure 3-15cand d,which show how the ballÕs height changes. How are the ballÕs posi-
tion and velocity related? The ball reaches its maximum height at the

instant of time when its velocity is zero.
At 2.04 s, the ball reaches its maximum height and its velocity is zero.
What is the ballÕs acceleration at that point? The slope of the line in the 

v-tgraphs in Figure 3-15a and 3-15b is constant at 9.80 m/s2. Often, when people are asked about the acceleration of an object at thetop of its flight, they do not take the time to fully analyze the situation,
and respond that the acceleration at this point is zero. However, this is not

the case. At the top of the flight, the ballÕs velocity is 0 m/s. What would

happen if its acceleration were also zero? Then the ballÕs velocity would

not be changing and would remain at 0 m/s. If this were the case, the ball

would not gain any downward velocity and would simply hover in the air

at the top of its flight. Because this is not the way objects tossed in the air

behave on Earth, you know that the acceleration of an object at the top of

its flight must not be zero. Further, because you know that the object will

fall from that height, you know that the acceleration must be downward.

Amusement parks use the concept of free fall to designrides that give the riders the sensation of free fall. These types of rides 
usually consist of three parts: the ride to the top, momentary suspension,
and the plunge downward. Motors provide the force needed to move the

cars to the top of the ride. When the cars are in free fall, the most massive

rider and the least massive rider will have the same acceleration. Suppose

the free-fall ride at an amusement park starts at rest and is in free fall for
1.5 s. What would be its velocity at the end of 1.5 s? Choose a coordinate

system with a positive axis upward and the origin at the initial position of

3.3Section Review
physicspp.com/self_check_quizYou notice a water balloon fall past your classroom window. You
estimate that it took the balloon about 
tseconds to fall the length ofthe window and that the window is about ymeters high. Suppose theballoon started from rest. Approximately how high above the top of the

window was it released? Your answer should be in terms of 
t, y, g, andnumerical constants. 
Remember to define the positive direction when establishing your coordi-
nate system. As motion problems increase in complexity, it becomes
increasingly important to keep all the signs consistent. This means that any
displacement, velocity, or acceleration that is in the same direction as the

one chosen to be positive will be positive. Thus, any displacement, veloc-

ity, or acceleration that is in the direction opposite to the one chosen to be

positive should be indicated with a negative sign. Sometimes it might be

appropriate to choose upward as positive. At other times, it might be 

easier to choose downward as positive. You can choose either direction you

want, as long as you stay consistent with that convention throughout the

solution of that particular problem. Suppose you solve one of the practice

problems on the preceding page again, choosing the direction opposite to
the one you previously designated as the positive direction for the coordi-

nate system. You should arrive at the same answer, provided that you

assigned signs to each of the quantities that were consistent with the coor-

dinate system. It is important to be consistent with the coordinate system

to avoid getting the signs mixed up.

Small variations in the acceleration due to gravity, 
g, occur at different places on Earth. This is because gvaries with distance from the center of Earth and is
influenced by the subsurface geology. In addition, 
gvaries with latitude due to
EarthÕs rotation.

at High Velocities
Can time passdifferently in two ref-
erence frames? How can one of a pair of
twins age more than the other? Light ClockConsider the following
thought experiment using a light clock.
A light clock is a vertical tube with a

mirror at each end. A short pulse of light
is introduced at one end and allowed to

bounce back and forth within the tube.

Time is measured by counting the num-

ber of bounces made by the pulse of

light. The clock will be accurate becausethe speed of a pulse of light is always 
c,which is 3108m/s, regardless of the
velocity of the light source or the observer.
Suppose this light clock is placed in avery fast spacecraft. When the spacecraft goes at

slow speeds, the light beam bounces vertically

in the tube. If the spacecraft is moving fast, the

light beam still bounces verticallyÑat least as

seen by the observer in the spacecraft. 
A stationary observer on Earth, however, sees
the pulse of light move diagonally because of
the movement of the spacecraft. Thus, to the

stationary observer, the light beam moves a

greater distance. Distancevelocity 
time, 
so if the distance traveled by the light beam
increases, the product (v
elocitytime) alsomust increase. 
Because the speed of the light pulse, 
c, is thesame for any observer, time must be 
increasingfor the stationary observer. 
That is, the station-
ary observer sees the moving clock ticking

slower than the same clock on Earth. 
Suppose the time per tick seen by the station-
ary observer on Earth is 
ts, the time seen by the
observer on the spacecraft is 
to, the length ofthe light clock is cto, the velocity of the space-
craft is v, and the speed of light is c. For every
tick, the spacecraft moves 
vtsand the lightpulse moves 
cto. This leads to the following
equation:tsTo the stationary observer, the closer 
vis toc,the slower the clock ticks. To the observer 
on the spacecraft, however, the clock keeps 

perfect time.
Time DilationThis phenomenon is calledtime dilation and it applies to every process
associated with time aboard the spacecraft. For

example, biological 
aging will proceed moreslowly in the 
spacecraft than on Earth. So if theobserver on the spacecraft is one of a pair of

twins, he or she would age more slowly than

the other twin on Earth. This is called the twin
paradox. Time dilation has resulted in a lot of
speculation about space travel. If spacecraft
were able to travel 
at speeds close to the speedof light, trips to distant stars would take only 

a few years for the astronaut.

Analyze and ConcludeAn express train, traveling
at 36.0 m/s, is accidentally sidetracked onto a local

train track. The express engineer spots a local train
exactly 1.00102m ahead on the same track andtraveling in the same direction. The local engineer

is unaware of the situation. The express engineer

jams on the brakes and slows the express train at a

constant rate of 3.00 m/s2. If the speed of the localtrain is 11.0 m/s, will the express train be able to

stop in time, or will there be a collision? To solve

this problem, take the position of the express train
when the engineer first sights the local train as a
point of origin. Next, keeping in mind that the
local train has exactly a 1.00102m lead, calculatehow far each train is from the origin at the end of

the 12.0 s it would take the express train to stop

(accelerate at 3.00 m/s2from 36 m/s to 0 m/s).a.On the basis of your calculations, would you

conclude that a collision will occur? b.The calculations that you made do not allow for

equilibriumImagine that a train is speeding down a railroad track at 80 km/h when

suddenly the engineer sees a truck stalled at a railroad crossing ahead.The engineer applies the brakes to try to stop the train before it crashes
into the truck. Because the brakes cause an acceleration in the direction
opposite the trainÕs velocity, the train will slow 
down. Imaginethat, in this
case, the engineer is able to stop the train just before it crashes into the

truck. But what if instead of moving at 80 km/h the train had been 
moving at 100 km/h? What would have to happen for the train to avoid

hitting the truck? The acceleration provided by the trainÕs brakes would

have to be greater because the engineer still has the same distance in which

to stop the train. Similarly, if the train was going 80 km/h but had been

much closer to the truck when the engineer started to apply the brake, the

acceleration also would need to be greater because the train would need to

stop in less time.
Horizons Companies086-095 CH04-S1-845813  3/12/04  3:26 AM  Page 87Force and Motion
What happened to make the train slow down? A 
forceis a push or pullexerted on an object. Forces can cause objects to speed up, slow down, or
change direction as they move. When an engineer applies the brakes, the

brakes exert a force on the wheels and cause the train to slow down. Based

on the definitions of velocity and acceleration, this can be restated as fol-

lows: a force exerted on an object causes that objectÕs velocity to change;

that is, a force causes an acceleration.
Consider a textbook resting on a table. How can you cause it to move?
Two possibilites are that you can push on it or you can pull on it. The push

or pull is a force that you exert on the textbook. If you push harder on an

object, you have a greater effect on its motion. The direction in which the

force is exerted also mattersÑif you push the book to the right, the book

moves in a different direction from the direction it would move if you

pushed it to the left. The symbol 
Fis a vector and represents the size and
direction of a force, while 
Frepresents only the magnitude.
When considering how a force affects motion, it is important to identify
the object of interest. This object is called the system. Everything around the

object that exerts forces on it is called the external world. In the case of the

book in Figure 4-1,the book is the system. Your hand and gravity are parts
of the external world that can interact with the book by pushing or pulling

on it and potentially causing its motion to change.
Contact Forces and Field Forces
Again, think about the different ways in which you could move a text-
book. You could touch it directly and push or pull it, or you could tie a string

around it and pull on the string. These are examples of contact forces. A

contact force exists when an object from the external world touches a 

system and thereby exerts a force on it. If you are holding this physics text-

book right now, your hands are exerting a contact force on it. If you place the

book on a table, you are no longer exerting a force on the book. The table,

however, is exerting a force because the table and the book are in contact.
There are other ways in which you could change the motion of the 
textbook. You could drop it, and as you learned in Chapter 3, it would

accelerate as it falls to the ground. The gravitational force of Earth acting

on the book causes this acceleration. This force affects the book whether
or not Earth is actually touching it. This is an example of a field force. Field

forces are exerted without contact. Can you think of other kinds of field

forces? If you have ever experimented with magnets, you know that they

exert forces without touching. You will investigate magnetism and other

similar forces in more detail in future chapters. For now, the only field

force that you need to consider is the gravitational force.
Forces result from interactions; thus, each force has a specific and identifi-
able cause called the agent. You should be able to name the agent exerting
each force, as well as the system upon which the force is exerted. For exam-

ple, when you push your textbook, your hand (the agent) exerts a force on

the textbook (the system). If there are not both an agent and a system, a force

does not exist. What about the gravitational force? If you allow your text-

book to fall, the agent is the mass of Earth exerting a field force on the book.88Chapter 4Forces in One Dimension

To make a physical
model of the forces acting on an
object, apply the particle model

and draw an arrow to represent

each force. Label each force,
including its agent. 
abFor each of the following situations, specify the system and draw a motion diagram and a free-body diagram. Label all forces with their agents, and indicate the direction of the

acceleration and of the net force. Draw vectors of appropriate lengths.1.A flowerpot falls freely from a windowsill. (Ignore any forces due to air resistance.) 
2.A sky diver falls downward through the air at constant velocity. (The air exerts an 
upward force on the person.) 3.A cable pulls a crate at a constant speed across a horizontal surface. The surface

provides a force that resists the crateÕs motion. 
4.A rope lifts a bucket at a constant speed. (Ignore air resistance.) 
5.A rope lowers a bucket at a constant speed. (Ignore air resistance.) 
Free-body diagrams
Just as pictorial models and motion diagrams areuseful in solving problems about motion, similar representations will helpyou to analyze how forces affect motion. The first step in solving any prob-

lem is to create a pictorial model. For example, to represent the forces on

a ball tied to a string or held in your hand, sketch the situations, as shown

in Figures 4-2aand 4-2b.
Circle the system and identify every place where
the system touches the external world. It is at these places that contact

forces are exerted. Identify the contact forces. Then identify any field forces

on the system. This gives you the pictorial model.
To make a physical representation of the forces acting on the ball in
Figures 4-2a and 4-2b, apply the particle model and represent the object

with a dot. Represent each force with a blue arrow that points in the 

direction that the force is applied. Try to make the length of each arrow 

proportional to the size of the force. Often, you will draw these diagrams

before you know the magnitudes of all the forces. In such cases, make your

best estimate. Always draw the force arrows pointing 
away 
from the particle,
even when the force is a push. Make sure that you label each force. Use the 

symbol 
Fwith a subscript label to identify both the agent and the object onwhich the force is exerted. Finally, choose a direction to be positive and indi-

cate this off to the side of your diagram. Usually, you select the positive

direction to be in the direction of the greatest amount of force. This 

typically makes the problem easiest to solve by reducing the number of

negative values in your calculations. This type of physical model, which 

represents the forces acting on a system, is called a 
free-body diagram.086-095 CH04-S1-845813  5/31/04  11:28 PM  Page 890.501.001.502.002.503.003.50

Force and Acceleration
How does an object move when one or more forces are exerted on it?
One way to find out is by doing experiments. As before, begin by consid-
ering a simple situation. Once you fully understand that situation, then

you can add more complications to it. In this case, begin with one con-

trolled force exerted horizontally on an object. The horizontal direction is
a good place to start because gravity does not act horizontally. Also, to

reduce complications resulting from the object rubbing against the surface,

do the experiments on a very smooth surface, such as ice or a very well-pol-

ished table, and use an object with wheels that spin easily. In other words,

you are trying to reduce the resistance to motion in the situation.
To determine how force, acceleration, and velocity are related, you need
to be able to exert a constant and controlled force on an object. How can

you exert such a controlled force? A stretched rubber band exerts a pulling

force; the farther you stretch it, the greater the force with which it pulls

back. If you always stretch the rubber band the same amount, you always

exert the same force. 
Figure 4-3ashows a rubber band, stretched a con-
stant 1 cm, pulling a low-resistance cart. If you perform this experiment

and determine the cartÕs velocity for some period of time, you could 

construct a graph like the one shown in 
Figure 4-3b.
Does this graph lookdifferent from what you expected? What do you notice about the velocity?

The constant increase in the velocity is a result of the constant acceleration

the stretched rubber band gives the cart.
How does this acceleration depend upon the force? To find out, repeat
the experiment, this time with the rubber band stretched to a constant 
2 cm, and then repeat it again with the rubber band stretched longer and
longer each time. For each experiment, plot a velocity-time graph like the

one in Figure 4-3b, calculate the acceleration, and then plot the accelera-

tions and forces for all the trials to make a force-acceleration graph, as
shown in 
Figure 4-4a.What is the relationship between the force and
acceleration? ItÕs a linear relationship where the greater the force is, the

greater the resulting acceleration. As you did in Chapters 2 and 3, you can

apply the straight-line equation ymxbto this graph. Figure 4-3
Because the rubber
band is stretched a constant

amount, it applies a constant 

force on the cart, which is

designed to be low-friction 
(a).The cartÕs motion can be graphed

and shown to be a linear
relationship (b).Matt Meadows086-095 CH04-S1-845813  3/12/04  3:29 AM  Page 90Acceleration (m/s2)Application of force (in cm of stretch)10234

The graph shows
that as the force increases, so
does the acceleration 
(a).You
can see that the slope of the

force-acceleration graph dependsupon the number of carts 
(b).What is the physical meaning of this slope? Perhaps it describes some-
thing about the object that is accelerating. What happens if the object
changes? Suppose that a second, identical cart is placed on top of the first,
and then a third cart is added. The rubber band would be pulling two carts,

and then three. A plot of the force versus acceleration for one, two, and

three carts is shown in 
Figure 4-4b.
The graph shows that if the same force
is applied in each situation, the acceleration of two carts is 
12the accelera-tion of one cart, and the acceleration of three carts is 1
3the acceleration ofone cart. This means that as the number of carts is increased, a greater forceis needed to produce the same acceleration. In this example, you would

have to stretch the rubber band farther to get a greater amount of force. The

slopes of the lines in Figure 4-4b depend upon the number of carts; that
is, the slope depends on the total mass of the carts. If the slope, 
kin thiscase, is defined as the reciprocal of the mass (
k1/m), then aF/m, or Fma.What information is contained in the equation aF/m? It tells you that
a force applied to an object causes that object to experience a change in
motionÑthe force causes the object to accelerate. It also tells you that for

the same object, if you double the force, you will double the objectÕs accel-

eration. Lastly, if you apply the same force to several different objects, the

one with the most mass will have the smallest acceleration and the one

with the least mass will have the greatest acceleration.
What are the proper units for measuring force? Because Fma, oneunit of force causes a 1-kg mass to accelerate at 1 m/s2, so one force unit has the dimensions 1 kgm/s2. The unit1 kgm/s2is called the newton, representedby N. One newton of force applied to a 1-kg

object will cause it to have an acceleration

of 1 m/s2. Do these units make sense?Think about a sky diver who is falling

through the air. The properties affecting his

motion are his mass and the acceleration
due to the gravitational force, so these units

do make sense.

is a net force applied in (c)and(d),as shown by the free-bodydiagrams.Combining Forces
What happens if you and a friend each push a table and exert 100 N of
force on it? When you and your friend push together, you give the table a

greater acceleration than when you push against each other. In fact, when

you push together, you give the table twice the acceleration that it would

have if just one of you applied 100 N of force. When you push on the table

in opposite directions with the same amount of force, as in 
Figure 4-5a,the table does not move at all.
Figure 4-5band cshow free-body diagrams for these two situations.
Figure 4-5dshows a third free-body diagram in which your friend pushes
on the table twice as hard as you in the opposite direction. Below each

free-body diagram is a vector representing the total result of the two forces.

When the force vectors are in the same direction, they can be replaced by

one vector with a length equal to their combined length. When the forcesare in opposite directions, the resulting vector 
is the length of the differencebetween the two vectors. Another 
term for the vector sum of all the forces
on an object is the net force.
You also can analyze the situation mathematically. Assume that you are
pushing the table in the positive direction with a 100 N force in the above

cases. In the first case, your friend is pushing with a negative force of 100 N.

Adding them together gives a total force of 0 N, which means there is no

acceleration. In the second case, your friendÕs force is 100 N, so the total

force is 200 N in the positive direction and the table accelerates in the 

positive direction. In the third case, your friendÕs force is 
200 N, so the
total force is 100 N and the table will accelerate in the negative direction.

these forces are applied in the same direction, find the net horizontal

force on the canoe. 
7.If the same two forces as in the previous problem are exerted on 

the canoe in opposite directions, what is the net horizontal force 

on the canoe? Be sure to indicate the direction of the net force. 
8.Three confused sleigh dogs are trying to pull a sled across the

Alaskan snow. Alutia pulls east with a force of 35 N, Seward also
pulls east but with a force of 42 N, and big Kodiak pulls west with 

a force of 53 N. What is the net force on the sled? 
Newton’s Second Law
You could conduct a series of experiments in which you and your friend
vary the net force exerted on the table and measure the acceleration in each
case. You would find that the acceleration of the table is proportional to

the net force exerted on it and inversely proportional to its mass. In other

words, if the net force of you and your friend acting on the table is 100 N,

the table will experience the same acceleration as it would if only you were

acting on it with a force of 100 N. Taking this into account, the mathe-

matical relationship among force, mass, and acceleration can be rewritten

in terms of the net force. The observation that the acceleration of an object

is proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to the mass of

the object being accelerated is NewtonÕs second law,
which is representedby the following equation.
Notice that NewtonÕs second law can be rearranged to the form 
Fma,which you learned about previously. If the table that you and your friend

were pushing was 15.0 kg and the two of you each pushed with a force of

50.0 N in the same direction, what would be the acceleration of the table?

To find out, calculate the net force, 50.0 N
50.0 N
100.0 N, and apply
NewtonÕs second law by dividing the net force of 100.0 N by the mass of

the table, 15.0 kg, to get an acceleration of 6.67 m/s
2.Here is a useful strategy for finding how the motion of an object
depends on the forces exerted on it. First, identify all the forces acting 
on the object. Draw a free-body diagram showing the direction and 

relative strength of each force acting on the system. Then, add the forces 

to find the net force. Next, use NewtonÕs second law to calculate the 

acceleration. Finally, if necessary, use kinematics to find the velocity 

or position of the object. When you learned about kinematics in Chapters

2 and 3, you studied the motion of objects without regard for the causes

of motion. You now know that an unbalanced force, a net force, is the

cause of a change in velocity (an acceleration).
NewtonÕs Second Law
aFmnetThe acceleration of an object is equal to the sum of the forces acting on the
object, divided by the mass of the object.086-095 CH04-S1-845813  3/12/04  3:31 AM  Page 93Newton’s First Law
What is the motion of an object with no net force acting on it? A stationary object with no net force acting on it will stay at its position.
Consider a moving object, such as a ball rolling on a surface. How long

will the ball continue to roll? It will depend on the quality of the surface.

If the ball is rolled on a thick carpet that offers much resistance, it will

come to rest quickly. If it is rolled on a hard, smooth surface that offers 

little resistance, such as a bowling alley, the ball will roll for a long time

with little change in velocity. Galileo did many experiments, and he con-

cluded that in the ideal case of zero resistance, horizontal motion would

never stop. Galileo was the first to recognize that the general principles of

motion could be found by extrapolating experimental results to the ideal

case, in which there is no resistance to slow down an objectÕs motion.
In the absence of a net force, the motion (or lack of motion) of both the
moving ball and the stationary object continues as it was. Newton recognized

this and generalized GalileoÕs results in a single statement. This statement,

Òan object that is at rest will remain at rest, and an object that is moving

will continue to move in a straight line with constant speed, if and only if

the net force acting on that object is zero,Ó is called NewtonÕs first law.

086-095 CH04-S1-845813  3/12/04  3:31 AM  Page 94InertiaNewtonÕs first law is sometimes called the law of inertia. Is inertia
a force? No. Inertiais the tendency of an object to resist change. If 
an object is at rest, it tends to remain at rest. If it is moving at a constant
velocity, it tends to continue moving at that velocity. Forces are results of

interactions between two objects; they are not properties of single objects,

so inertia cannot be a force. Remember that because velocity includes both

the speed and direction of motion, a net force is required to change either 
the speed or direction of an objectÕs motion.
EquilibriumAccording to NewtonÕs first law, a net force is something that
causes the velocity of an object to change. If the net force on an object is
zero, then the object is in equilibrium.An object is in equilibrium if it isat rest or if it is moving at a constant velocity. Note that being at rest is sim-

ply a special case of the state of constant velocity, 
v0. NewtonÕs first law
identifies a net force as something that disturbs a state of equilibrium.
Thus, if there is no net force acting on the object, then the object does not

experience a change in speed or direction and is in equilibrium.By understanding and applying NewtonÕs first and second laws, you can
often figure out something about the relative sizes of forces, even in situa-

tions in which you do not have numbers to work with. Before looking at

Table 4-2,
which lists some of the commontypes of forces. You will be dealing with many of these throughout your

study of physics.
When analyzing forces and motion, it is important to keep in mind thatthe world is dominated by resistance. NewtonÕs ideal, resistance-free world

is not easy to visualize. If you analyze a situation and find that the result is

different from a similar experience that you have had, ask yourself if this is

because of the presence of resistance. In addition, many terms used in

physics have everyday meanings that are different from those understood

in physics. When talking or writing about physics issues, be careful to use

these terms in their precise, scientific way.

block is measured. When the same force is the only

force exerted on a second block, the acceleration is

three times as large. What can you conclude about

the masses of the two blocks?

The net force on the
ball is the weight force, Fg.NewtonÕs second law describes the connection between the cause of a
change in an objectÕs velocity and the resulting displacement. This
law identifies the relationship between the net force exerted on an object

and the objectÕs acceleration.
Using Newton’s Second Law
What is the weight force, 
Fg, exerted on an object of mass m? NewtonÕs
second law can help answer this question. Consider the pictorial and phys-

ical models in Figure 4-6,which show a free-falling ball in midair. With
what objects is it interacting? Because it is touching nothing and air resist-
ance can be neglected, the only force acting on it is Fg. You know from
Chapter 3 that the ballÕs acceleration is 
g. NewtonÕs second law then
becomes Fgmg. Both the force and the acceleration are downward. The
magnitude of an objectÕs weight is equal to its mass times the acceleration

it would have if it were falling freely. It is important to keep in mind that

even when an object is not experiencing free-fall, the gravitational force of

Earth is still acting on the object.This result is true on Earth, as well as on any other planet, although the
magnitude of gwill be different on other planets. Because the value of 
gismuch less on the Moon than on Earth, astronauts who landed on the
Moon weighed much less while on the Moon, even though their mass had

not changed. ScalesA bathroom scale contains springs. When you stand on the scale,
the scale exerts an upward force on you because you are in contact with it.
Because you are not accelerating, the net force acting on you must be zero.

Therefore, the spring force, 
Fsp, pushing up on you must be the same mag-
nitude as your weight, 
Fg, pulling down on you, as shown in the pictorial
and physical models in 
Figure 4-7.The reading on the scale is determinedby the amount of force the springs inside it exert on you. A spring scale,

therefore, measures weight, not mass. If you were on a different planet, the

compression of the spring would be different, and consequently, the scaleÕs

reading would be different. Remember that the proper unit for expressing

mass is kilograms and because weight is a force, the proper unit used to

express weight is the newton.

When solving force and motion problems, use the following strategies.
1.Read the problem carefully, and sketch a pictorial model. 
2.Circle the system and choose a coordinate system.3.Determine which quantities are known and which are unknown.
4.Create a physical model by drawing a motion diagram showing
the direction of the acceleration, and create a free-body diagram
showing the net force.5.Use NewtonÕs laws to link acceleration and net force. 6.Rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown quantity. 
7.Substitute known quantities with their units into the equation 

and solve.8.Check your results to see if they are reasonable.
Apparent weight
What is weight? Because the weight force is
defined as Fgmg, Fgchanges when gvaries. On or near the
surface of Earth, gis approximately constant, so an objectÕs
weight does not change appreciably as it moves around near
EarthÕs surface. If a bathroom scale provides the only upward

force on you, then it reads your weight. What would it read if

you stood with one foot on the scale and one foot on the floor?

What if a friend pushed down on your shoulders or up on your

elbows? Then there would be other contact forces on you, and

the scale would not read your weight.
What happens if you stand on a scale in an elevator? As long as the 
elevator is in equilibrium, the scale will read your weight. What would the

scale read if the elevator accelerates upward? 
Figure 4-9shows the picto-
rial and physical models for this situation. You are the system, and upward

is the positive direction. Because the acceleration of the system is upward,

the upward force of the 
scale must be greater than the downward force of
your weight. Therefore, the scale reading is greater than your weight. If you

ride in an 
elevator like this, you would feel heavier because the floor would
press harder on your feet. On the other hand, if the acceleration is down-

ward, then you would feel lighter, and the scale would have a lower read-

ing. The force exerted by the scale is called the apparent weight. An objectÕs

apparent weight
is the force an object experiences as a result of all theforces acting on it, giving the object an acceleration.Imagine that the cable holding the elevator breaks. What would 
the scale read then? The scale and you would both accelerate with 

ag. According to this formula, the scale would read zero and your 
apparent weight would be zero. That is, you would be weightless. However,

weightlessness
does not mean that an objectÕs weight is actually zero;
rather, it means that there are no contact forces pushing up on the object,

and the objectÕs apparent weight is zero.

Drag Force and Terminal Velocity 
It is true that the particles in the air around an object exert forces on it. Airactually exerts a huge force, but in most cases, it exerts a balanced force on
all sides, and therefore it has no net effect. Can you think of any experiences

that help to prove that air exerts a force? When you stick a suction cup on

a smooth wall or table, you remove air from the ÒinsideÓ of it. The suction

cup is difficult to remove because of the net force of the air on the Òoutside.Ó
So far, you have neglected the force of air on an object moving through
the air. In actuality, when an object moves through any fluid, such as air or

water, the fluid exerts a drag force on the moving object in the direction

opposite to its motion. A drag forceis the force exerted by a fluid on the
object moving through the fluid. This force is dependent on the motion of

the object, the properties of the object, and the properties of the fluid that
the object is moving through. For example, as the speed of the object

increases, so does the magnitude of the drag force. The size and shape of

the object also affects the drag force. The drag force is also affected by the

properties of the fluid, such as its viscosity and temperature. 
096-101 CH04-S2-845813  5/31/04  11:40 PM  Page 100If you drop a table-tennis ball, as in 
Figure 4-10,
it has very little velocity at the start, and thus only 
a small drag force. The downward force of gravity 

is much stronger than the upward drag force, so

there is a downward acceleration. As the ballÕs

velocity increases, so does the drag force. Soon, the

drag force equals the force of gravity. When this

happens, there is no net force, and so there is no

acceleration. The constant velocity that is reached

when the drag force equals the force of gravity is

called the terminal velocity.
When light objects with large surface areas arefalling, the drag force has a substantial effect on
their motion, and they quickly reach terminal
velocity. Heavier, more-compact objects are not affected as much by the

drag force. For example, the terminal velocity of a table-tennis ball in air is

9 m/s, that of a basketball is 20 m/s, and that of a baseball is 42 m/s.

Competitive skiers increase their terminal velocities by decreasing the drag

force on them. They hold their bodies in an egg shape and wear smooth

clothing and streamlined helmets. Sky divers can increase or decrease their

terminal velocity by changing their body orientation and shape. A hori-

zontal, spread-eagle shape produces the slowest terminal velocity, about

60 m/s. Because a parachute changes the shape of the sky diver when it

opens, a sky diver becomes part of a very large object with a correspond-

ingly large drag force and a terminal velocity of about 5 m/s.

the object undergoes acceleration. You know that this force can be
either a field force or a contact force. But what causes the force? If you

experiment with two magnets, you can feel each magnet pushing or

pulling the other. Similarly, if you pull on a lever, you can feel the lever

pulling back against you. Which is the agent and which is the object? 
Identifying Interaction Forces
Imagine that you and a friend are each wearing in-line skates (with all
the proper safety gear), and your friend is standing right in front of you,

with his back to you. You push your friend so that he starts rolling forward.

What happens to you? You move backwards. Why? Recall that a force is the

result of an interaction between two objects. When you push your friend

forward, you come into contact with him and exert a force that moves him

forward. However, because he is also in contact with you, he also exerts a

force on you, and this results in a change in your motion.
Forces always come in pairs. Consider you (Student A) as one system
and your friend (Student B) as another. What horizontal forces act on each

of the two systems? 
Figure 4-11
shows the free-body diagram for the 
systems. Looking at this diagram, you can see that each system experiences

a force exerted by the other. The two forces, 
FA on Band FB on A, are the forces of interaction between the two of you. Notice the symmetry 

in the subscripts: A on B and B on A. What do you notice about the direc-

tions of these forces? What do you expect to be true about their relative

magnitudes?The forces FA on Band FB on Aare an interaction pair. An 
interaction pairis two forces that are in opposite directions and have equal magnitude.

Sometimes, this also is called an action-reaction pair of forces. This might

suggest that one causes the other; however, this is not true. For example,

the force of you pushing your friend doesnÕt cause your friend to exert a

force on you. The two forces either exist together or not at all. They both

result from the contact between the two of you. 
Newton’s Third Law
The force of you on your friend is equal in magnitude and opposite in
direction to the force of your friend on you. This is summarized 

in NewtonÕs third law,
which states that all forces come in pairs. The 
two forces in a pair act on different objects and are equal in strength and

opposite in direction. Consider the situation of you holding a book in your hand. Draw one
free-body diagram each for you and for the 
book. Are there any interaction

pairs? When identifying interaction pairs, keep in mind that they always
will occur in two different free-body diagrams, and they always will have

the symmetry of subscripts noted on the previous page. In this case, there

is one interaction pair, 
Fbook on handand Fhand on book. Notice also that eachobject has a weight. If the weight force is due to an interaction between the

object and EarthÕs mass, then shouldnÕt each of these objects also exert a

force on Earth? If this is the case, shouldnÕt Earth be accelerating?
Consider a soccer ball sitting on a table. The table, in turn, is sitting on
Earth, as shown in 
Figure 4-12.First, analyze the forces acting on the ball. The table exerts an upward force on the ball, and the mass of 

Earth exerts a downward gravitational force on the ball. Even though these

forces are in the opposite direction on the same object, they are not an
interaction pair. They are simply two forces acting on the same object, not

the interaction between two objects. Consider the ball and the table

together. In addition to the upward force exerted by the table on the 

ball, the ball exerts a downward force on the table. This is one pair 

of forces. The ball and Earth also have an interaction pair. Thus, the inter-

action pairs related to the soccer ball are Fball on tableFtable on balland Fball on EarthFEarth on ball. It is important to keep in mind that an inter-action pair must consist of two forces of equal magnitude pointing in

opposite directions. These opposing forces must act on two different

objects that can exert a force against each other.
The acceleration caused by the force of an object interacting with Earth is
usually a very small number. Under most circumstances, the number is so

small that for problems involving falling or stationary objects, Earth 
can betreated as part of the external world rather than as a second system.

Tension
is simply a specific name for the force exerted by a string or
rope. A simplification within this textbook is the assumption that all strings
and ropes are massless. To understand tension in more detail, consider 

the situation in Figure 4-14,where a bucket hangs from a rope attachedto the ceiling. The rope is about to break in the middle. If the rope breaks,

the bucket will fall; thus, before it breaks, there must be forces holding the

rope together. The force that the top 
part of the rope exerts on the bottompart is Ftop on bottom. NewtonÕs third law states that this force must be part
of an interaction pair. The other member of the pair is the force that the

bottom part exerts on the top, Fbottom on top. These forces, equal in magni-
tude but opposite in direction, also are shown in Figure 4-14.
Think about this situation in another way. Before the rope breaks, the
bucket is in equilibrium. This means that the force of its weight downward

must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the tension in the
rope upward. Similarly, if you look at the point in the rope just above the

bucket, it also is in equilibrium. Therefore, the tension of the rope below it

pulling down must be equal to the tension of the rope above it pulling up. You

can move up the rope, considering any point in the rope, and see that the

tension forces are pulling equally in both directions. Because the very bottom

of the rope has a tension equal to the weight of the bucket, the tension every-

where in the rope is equal to the weight of the bucket. Thus, the tension in the

rope is the weight of all objects below it. Because the rope is assumed to be

massless, the tension everywhere in the rope is equal to the bucketÕs weight.
Tension forces also are at work in a tug-of-war, like the one shown in
Figure 4-15.If team A, on the left, is exerting a force of 500 N and the rope
does not move, then team B, on the right, also must be pulling with a force

of 500 N. What is the tension in the rope in this case? If each team pulls

with 500 N of force, is the tension 1000 N? To decide, think of the rope 

as divided into two halves. The left-hand end is not moving, so the net

force on it is zero. Thus, 
FA on ropeFright on left500 N. Similarly, 
FB on ropeFleft on right500 N. But the two tensions, 
Fright on leftand Fleft on right, are an interaction pair, so they are equal and opposite. Thus,
the tension in the rope equals the force with which each team pulls, or 

500 N. To verify this, you could cut the rope in half, tie the ends to a spring

scale, and ask the two teams each to pull with 500 N of force. You would

see that the scale reads 500 N.

The normal force
on an object is not always equalto its weight. In 
(a)the normalforce is equal to the objectÕs
weight. In (b)the normal force is less than the objectÕs weight. 

In (c)the normal force is greaterthan the objectÕs weight.The Normal Force
Any time two objects are in contact, they each exert a force on each
other. Think about a box sitting on a table. There is a downward force due

to the gravitational attraction of Earth. There also is an upward force that

the table exerts on the box. This force must exist, because the box is in
equilibrium. The normal forceis the perpendicular contact force exertedby a surface on another object. 
The normal force always is perpendicular to the plane of contact between
two objects, but is it always equal to the weight of an object as in 
Figure4-16a?What if you tied a string to the box and pulled up on it a little bit,
but not enough to move the box, as shown in 
Figure 4-16b?When you
apply NewtonÕs second law to the box, you see that 
FNFstring on boxFgma0, which rearranges to FNFgFstring on box.You can see that in this case, the no
rmal force exerted by the table on the
box is less than the boxÕs weight, 
Fg. Similarly, if you pushed down on the
box on the table as shown in 
Figure 4-16c,the normal force would be
more than the boxÕs weight. Finding 
the normal force will be important inthe next chapter, when you begin dealing with resistance.

1.HypothesizeMost springs in bathroomscales cannot exert a force larger than
20 lbs (89 N). How is it possible that

you donÕt break the scale every time

you step on it? (Hint: Think about 
exerting a large force near the pivot 
of a see-saw.)
2.Solve

scales is 240 lbs (1068 N) and the

spring can exert a maximum of 20 lbs

(89 N), what ratio does the lever use?
Thinking
Critically
RackDialDial springPinionMain springCrankLeverCalibrating 
plateFg12The long levers rest on top of a calibrating plate that has 
the main spring attached to it. 
When you step on the scale, 
your weight, Fg, is exerted 
on the levers, which, in turn, 

exert a force on the 

calibrating plate and cause 
the main spring to stretch.4When the spring 
force, Fsp, from the main spring being 
stretched is equal 
to Fg, the crank, rack, and pinion 
no longer move, 
and your weight is 
shown on the dial.There are two long and two 
short levers that are attached 

to each other. Brackets in the 

lid of the scale sit on top of the 
levers to help evenly distribute 
your weight on the levers.3As the calibrating plate is pushed down 
by weight on the scale, the crank pivots. 
This, in turn, moves the rack and rotates 

the pinion. As a result, the dial on the 
scale rotates.Bathroom ScaleThe portable weighing scale was patented in 1896
by John H. Hunter. People used coin-operated

scales, usually located in stores, to weigh them-

selves until the advent of the home bathroom

scale in 1946. How does a bathroom scale work?

Key Concepts
¥An object that experiences a push or a pull has a force exerted on it.¥Forces have both direction and magnitude.
¥Forces may be divided into contact and field forces.
¥In a free-body diagram, always draw the force vectors leading away from the
object, even if the force is a push.
¥The forces acting upon an object can be added using vector addition to find

the net force.
¥NewtonÕs second law states that the acceleration of a system equals the net

force acting on it, divided by its mass.
¥NewtonÕs first law states that an object that is at rest will remain at rest, and

an object that is moving will continue to move in a straight line with

constant speed, if and only if the net force acting on that object is zero.¥An object with no net force acting on it is in equilibrium.aFnmetKey Concepts
¥The weight of an object depends upon the acceleration due to gravity and

the mass of the object.¥An objectÕs apparent weight is the force an object experiences as a result of

the contact forces acting on it, giving the object an acceleration.¥An object with no apparent weight experiences weightlessness.
¥The effect of drag on an objectÕs motion is determined by the objectÕs

weight, size, and shape.
¥If a falling object reaches a velocity such that the drag force is equal to the

objectÕs weight, it maintains that velocity, called the terminal velocity.
Key Concepts
¥All forces result from interactions between objects.
¥NewtonÕs third law states that the two forces that make up an interaction

pair of forces are equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction and act on

different objects.
¥In an interaction pair, 
FA on Bdoes not cause FB on A. The two forces either
exist together or not at all.¥Tension is the specific name for the force exerted by a rope or string.
¥The normal force is a support force resulting from the contact of two objects.

It is always perpendicular to the plane of contact between the two objects.

How do rock climbers keep from falling in situations like the one

shown on the preceding page? Notice that the climber has more
than one support point and that there are multiple forces acting on her.

She tightly grips crevices in the rock and has her feet planted on the rock
face, so there are two contact forces acting on her. Gravity is pulling on her

as well, so there are three total forces acting on the climber. One aspect of

this situation that is different from the ones that you have studied in 

earlier chapters is that the forces exerted by the rock face on the climber are

not horizontal or vertical forces. You know from previous chapters that

you can pick your coordinate system and orient it in the way that is most

useful to analyzing the situation. But what happens when the forces 
are not at right angles to each other? How can you set up a coordinate 

system and find for a net force when you are dealing with more than one

dimension?Section 5.1Vectors

Consider an example with force vectors. Recall the case in Chapter 4 in
which you and a friend both pushed on a table together. Suppose that you
each exerted 40 N of force to the right. Figure 5-1represents these vectors
in a free-body diagram with the resultant vector, the net force, shown

below it. The net force vector is 80 N, which is what you probably

expected. But how was this net force vector obtained? 
Vectors in Multiple Dimensions
The process for adding vectors works even when the vectors do not point
along the same straight line. If you are solving one of these two-dimensional

problems graphically, you will need to use a protractor, both to draw the

vectors at the correct angles and also to measure the direction and magni-

tude of the resultant vector. You can add vectors by placing them tip-to-tail

and then drawing the resultant of the vector by connecting the tail of the

first vector to the tip of the second vector, as shown in
Figure 5-2. Figure5-2ashows the two forces in the free-body diagram. In 
Figure 5-2b,
one ofthe vectors has been moved so that its tail is at the same place as the tip of

the other vector. Notice that its length and direction have not changed.

Because the length and direction are the only important characteristics of
the vector, the vector is unchanged by this movement. This is always true:

if you move a vector so that its length and direction are unchanged, the

vector is unchanged. Now, as in 
Figure 5-2c,you can draw the resultant
vector pointing from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the last vector

and measure it to obtain its magnitude. Use a protractor to measure the

direction of the resultant vector. Sometimes you will need to use trigonom-

etry to determine the length or direction of resultant vectors. Remember

that the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle can be found by using

the Pythagorean theorem. If you were adding together two vectors at right

angles, vector 
Apointing north and vector 
Bpointing east, you could use
the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant, R.If the two vectors to be added are at an angle other than 90
°, then you can
use the law of cosines or the law of sines.
Law of Sines

Choosing a coordinate system, such as the one in 
Figure 5-3a,is simi-lar to laying a grid drawn on a sheet of transparent plastic on top of a 
vector problem. You have to choose where to put the center of the grid (the 

origin) and establish the directions in which the axes point. Notice that in
the coordinate system shown in Figure 5-3a, the 
x-axis is drawn through
the origin with an arrow pointing in the positive direction. The positive 

y-axis is located 90
°counterclockwise from the positive 
x-axis and crossesthe x-axis at the origin.How do you choose the direction of the 
x-axis? There is never a single
correct answer, but some choices make the problem easier to solve than

others. When the motion you are describing is confined to the surface of

Earth, it is often convenient to have the 
x-axis point east and the y-axispoint north. When the motion involves an object moving through the air,

the positive 
x-axis is often chosen to be horizontal and the positive 
y-axisvertical (upward). If the motion is on a hill, itÕs convenient to place the

positive 
x-axis in the direction of the motion and the y-axis perpendicularto the x-axis. 
Component vectors
Defining a coordinate system allows you to describe
a vector in a different way. Vector 
Ashown in 
Figure 5-3b,
for example,
could be described as going 5 units in the positive 
x-direction and 4 unitsin the positive 
y-direction. You can represent this information in the form
of two vectors like the ones labeled 
Axand Ayin the diagram. Notice thatAxis parallel to the x-axis, and 
Ayis parallel to the y-axis. Further, you can
see that if you add 
Axand Ay, the resultant is the original vector, 
A. A vec-
tor can be broken into its components,
which are a vector parallel to the
x-axis and another parallel to the y-axis. This can always be done and the
following vector equation is always true.
AAxAyThis process of breaking a vector into its components is sometimes called
vector resolution.
Notice that the original vector is the hypotenuse of a
right triangle. This means that the magnitude of the original vector will

always be larger than the magnitudes of either component vector.
Another reason for choosing a coordinate system is that the direction of
any vector can be specified relative to those coordinates. The direction of a

vector is defined as the angle that the vector makes with the 
x-axis, meas-
ured counterclockwise. In Figure 5-3b, the angle, 
, tells the direction of thevector, 
A. All algebraic calculations involve only the positive components of
vectors, not the vectors themselves. In addition to measuring the lengths of

the component vectors graphically, you can find the components by using

trigonometry. The components are calculated using the equations below,

where the angle, 
, is measured counterclockwise from the positive 
x-axis.

123Vector Addition
Use the following technique to solve problems for which
you need to add or subtract vectors.
1.Choose a coordinate system.2.Resolve the vectors into their 
x-components 
using AxAcos, and their y-components 
using AyAsin, where is the angle measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.3.Add or subtract the component vectors in 
the x-direction.4.Add or subtract the component vectors in
the y-direction.5.Use the Pythagorean theorem, 
RRx2Ry2, to find the magnitude of the resultant vector.
6.Use tan
1(RRxy)to find the angle of the resultant
vector.
Algebraic Addition of Vectors
You might be wondering why you need to
resolve vectors into their components. The answer
is that doing this often makes adding vectors

together much easier mathematically. Two or more

vectors (
A, B, C, etc.) may be 
added by first resolv-
ing each vector into its 
x- and y-components. The 
x-components are added to form the x-componentof the resultant: RxAxBxCx. Similarly, the
y-components are added to form the y-componentof the resultant: RyAyByCy. This process is illustrated graphically inFigure 5-5.Because Rxand Ryare at a right angle (90
°), the magnitude ofthe resultant vector can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, 
R2Rx2Ry2. To find the angle or direction of the resultant, recall that the
tangent of the angle that the vector makes with the 
x-axis is given by the
following. 
You can find the angle by using the tan
1key on your calculator. Note that
when tan 0, most calculators give the angle between 0
°and 90
°, andwhen tan 0, the angle is reported to be between 0
°and 90°.Angle of the Resultant Vector
tan1(RRxy)The angle of the resultant vector is equal to the inverse tangent of the quotient
of the y-component divided by the x-component of the resultant vector.

¥Definethe friction force.¥Distinguishbetween static

kinetic frictionstatic friction

coefficient of kinetic friction
coefficient of static friction
Push your hand across your desktop and feel the force called friction

opposing the motion. Push your book across the desk. When you
stop pushing, the book will continue moving for a little while, then it will

slow down and stop. The frictional force acting on the book gave it an

acceleration in the direction opposite to the one in which it was moving.

So far, you have neglected friction in solving problems, but friction is all

around you. You need it to both start and stop a bicycle and a car. If you

have ever walked on ice, you understand the importance of friction.
Static and Kinetic Friction
There are two types of friction. Both always oppose motion. When you
pushed your book across the desk, it experienced a type of friction that acts

on moving objects. This force is known as 
kinetic friction,and it isexerted on one surface by another when the two surfaces rub against each

other because one or both of them are moving.
To understand the other kind of friction, imagine trying to push a heavy
couch across the floor. You give it a push, but it does not move. Because it

does not move, NewtonÕs laws tell you that there must be a second hori-

zontal force acting on the couch, one that opposes your force and is equal

in size. This force is 
static friction,which is the force exerted on one surfaceby another when there is no motion between the two surfaces. You might

push harder and harder, 
as shown in 
Figures 5-8a and 5-8b,
but if thecouch still does not move, the force of friction must be getting larger. This

is because the static friction force acts in response to other forces. Finally,

when you push hard enough, as shown in 
Figure 5-8c,the couch will beginto move. Evidently, there is a limit to how large the static friction force can be.

Once your force is greater than this maximum static friction, the couch begins

moving and kinetic friction begins to act on it instead of static friction.
A model for friction forces
On what does a frictional force depend? Thematerials that the surfaces are made of play a role. For example, there is
more friction between skis and concrete than there is between skis and

snow. It may seem reasonable to think that the force of friction also might

depend on either the surface area in contact or the speed of the motion,
but experiments have shown that this is not true. The normal force

between the two objects does matter, however. The harder one object is

pushed against the other, the greater the force of friction that results.

There is a limit to
the ability of the static friction
force to match the applied force.126-130 CH05-S2-845813  6/1/04  6:31 AM  Page 126Section 5.2Friction

Figure 5-10
There is a linear
relationship between the frictionalforce and the normal force.Figure 5-9
The spring scale
pulls the block with a constant
force.If you pull a block along a surface at a constant velocity, according to
NewtonÕs laws, the frictional force must be equal and opposite to the force
with which you pull. You can pull a block of known mass along a table at

a constant velocity and use a spring scale, as shown in 
Figure 5-9,to meas-ure the force that you exert. You can then stack additional blocks on the

block to increase the normal force and repeat the measurement.Plotting the data will yield a graph like the one in Figure 5-10.
There isa direct proportion between the kinetic friction force and the normal force.

The different lines correspond to dragging the block along different surfaces.

Note that the line corresponding to the sandpaper surface has a steeper
slope than the line for the highly polished table. You would expect it to be

much harder to pull the block along sandpaper than along a polished
table, so the slope must be related to the magnitude of the resulting fric-

tional force. The slope of this line, designated 
k, is called the coefficientof kinetic frictionbetween the two surfaces and relates the frictional force
to the normal force, as shown below. 
The maximum static friction force is related to the normal force in a sim-ilar way as the kinetic 
friction force. Remember that the static friction force
acts in response to a force trying to cause a stationary object to start mov-

ing. If there is no such force acting on an object, the static friction force is
zero. If there is a force trying to cause motion, the static friction force will
increase up to a maximum value before it is overcome and motion starts. 
In the equation for the maximum static friction force, 
sis the coefficientof static frictionbetween the two surfaces, and 
sFNis the maximumstatic friction force that must be overcome before motion can begin. In

Figure 5-8c, the static friction force is balanced the instant before the couch
begins to move.

car stop before hitting the branch? The car has a mass of 2400 kg.
Here are a few important things to remember when dealing with fric-tional situations. First, friction always acts in a direction opposite to the
motion (or in the case of static friction, intended motion). Second, the
magnitude of the force of friction depends on the magnitude of the normal
force between the two rubbing surfaces; it does not necessarily depend on

the weight of either object. Finally, multiplying the coefficient of static 

friction and the normal force gives you the maximum static friction force.

Keep these things in mind as you review this section.
Causes of Friction
Allsurfaces, even those that appear
to be smooth, are rough at a
microscopic level. If you look at a
photograph of a graphite crystal

magnified by a scanning tunneling

microscope, the atomic level
surface irregularities of the crystal

are revealed. When two surfaces

touch, the high points on each are

in contact and temporarily bond.

This is the origin of both static

and kinetic friction. The details of

this process are still unknown and

are the subject of research in both

physics and engineering.126-130 CH05-S2-845813  6/1/04  4:34 AM  Page 130Section 5.3Force and Motion in Two Dimensions

BARABBAR  EquilibrantAABCBCFigure 5-11
An object is inequilibrium when all the forces 
on it add up to zero.You have already worked with several situations dealing with forces in
two dimensions. For example, when friction acts between two sur-
faces, you must take into account both the frictional force that is parallel

to the surface and the normal force that is perpendicular to it. So far, you

have considered only the motion along a level surface. Now you will use

your skill in adding vectors to analyze situations in which the forces acting

on an object are at angles other than 90
°.Equilibrium Revisited
Recall from Chapter 4 that when the net force on an object is zero, the
object is in equilibrium. According to NewtonÕs laws, the object will not

accelerate because there is no net force acting on it; an object in equilib-
rium is motionless or moves with constant velocity. You have already 

analyzed several equilibrium situations in which two forces acted on an

object. It is important to realize that equilibrium can occur no matter how

many forces act on an object. As long as the resultant is zero, the net force

is zero and the object is in equilibrium.Figure 5-11a
shows three forces exerted on a point object. What is the
net force acting on the object? Remember that vectors may be moved if you

do not change their direction (angle) or length. Figure 5-11b
shows the
addition of the three forces, 
A,B,
and C.Note that the three vectors form
a closed triangle. There is no net force; thus, the sum is zero and the object

is in equilibrium.Suppose that two forces are exerted on an object and the sum is not
zero. How could you find a third force that, when added to the other two,

would add up to zero, and therefore cause the object to be in equilibrium?

To find this force, first find the sum of the two forces already being exerted

on the object. This single force that produces the same effect as the two

individual forces added together is called the resultant force. The force that

you need to find is one with the same magnitude as the resultant force, but

in the opposite direction. A force that puts an object in equilibrium is
called the equilibrant.Figure 5-12
illustrates the procedure for findingthis force for two vectors. Note that this general procedure works for any

number of vectors.
Figure 5-12
The equilibrant is the same magnitude as the resultant, but opposite 
in direction.ab131-135 CH05-S3-845813  3/13/04  6:42 AM  Page 131132Chapter 5Forces in Two Dimensions

Motion Along an Inclined PlaneYou have applied NewtonÕs laws to a variety of equilibrium situations,
but only to motions that were either horizontal or vertical. How would

you apply them in a situation like the one in

Start by identifying the forces acting on the object, the skier, as shown
in Figure 5-13band sketching a free-body diagram. The gravitational force
on the skier is in the downward direction toward the center of Earth. There

is a normal force perpendicular to the hill, and the frictional forces oppos-
ing the skierÕs motion are parallel to the hill. The resulting free-body 

diagram is shown in 
Figure 5-13c.You can see that, other than the force
of friction, only one force acts horizontally or vertically, and you know

from experience that the acceleration of the skier will be along the slope.

How do you find the net force that causes the skier to accelerate?

5.3Section Review
The most important decision in problems involving motion along a
slope is what coordinate system to use. Because an objectÕs acceleration is
usually parallel to the slope, one axis, usually the 
x-axis, should be in that
direction. The y-axis is perpendicular to the x-axis and perpendicular to thesurface of the slope. With this coordinate system, you now have two forces,

the normal and frictional forces, in the directions of the coordinate axes;

however, the weight is not. This means that when an object is placed on an

inclined plane, the magnitude of the normal force between the object and

the plane will usually not be equal to the objectÕs weight.
You will need to apply NewtonÕs laws once in the 
x-direction and oncein the y-direction. Because the weight does not point in either of these
directions, you will need to break this vector into its 
x- and y-componentsbefore you can sum your forces in these two directions. Example Problem

5 and Example Problem 6 both showed this procedure.

with each other. Static friction is the force that must be overcome to cause 

an object to begin moving, while kinetic friction occurs between two objects in 

motion relative to each other. The kinetic friction force, 
Ff, kinetic, is defined by 
Ff, kinetickFN, where kis the coefficient of kinetic friction and FNis the nor-mal force acting on the object. The maximum static frictional force, 
Ff, max static, is defined by 
Ff, staticsFNwhere sis the coefficient of static friction and FNisthe normal force on the object. The maximum static frictional force that must be
overcome before movement is able to begin is 
sFN. If you apply a constant force
to pull an object along a horizontal surface at a constant speed, then the frictional
force opposing the motion is equal and opposite to the applied force, 
Fp.Therefore, 
FpFf. The normal force is equal and opposite to the objectÕs weight
when the object is on a horizontal surface and the applied force is horizontal.QUESTION

Roller CoastersRoller CoastersWhy are roller coasters fun?A roller-coaster ride would be no fun at all if not for
the forces acting on the coaster car and the rider.

What forces do riders experience as they ride a
roller coaster? The force of gravity acts on the

rider and the coaster car in the downward

direction. The seat of the car exerts a force on the
rider in the opposite direction. When the coaster
car makes a turn, the rider experiences a force
in the opposite direction. Also, there are forces
present due to the friction between the rider and

the seat, the side of the car, and the safety bar.
The Force Factor
Designers of roller
coasters take intoaccount the magni-
tude of the forces
exerted on the rider.

They design the
coaster in such a way
that the forces thrill
the rider without caus-ing injury or too
much discomfort. Designers measurethe amount of force
exerted on the rider by

calculating the force
factor. The force factor is equal to the force

exerted by the seat on the rider divided by the

weight of the rider. Suppose the rider weighs

about 68 kg. When the roller coaster is at the
bottom of a hill, the rider may experience a force

factor of 2. That means that at the bottom of the
hill, the rider will feel as though he or she
weighs twice as much, or in this case 136 kg.

Conversely, at the top of a hill the force factor

may be 0.5 and the rider will feel as though he

or she weighs half his or her normal weight.

Thus, designers create excitement by designing

portions that change the riderÕs apparent weight. 
The Thrill Factors
Roller-coaster designers
manipulate the way in which the body perceives

the external world to create that ÒthrillingÓ sen-

sation. For example, the roller coaster moves

up the first hill very slowly, tricking the rider

into thinking that the hill is higher than it is. 
The organs of the inner ear sense the positionof the head both when it is still and when it ismoving. These organs help maintain balance

by providing information to the brain. The

brain then sends nerve impulses to the skeletal

muscles to contract or relax to maintain bal-
ance. The constant change in position during 

a roller-coaster ride causes the organs of the
inner ear to send conflicting messages to the
brain. As a result, the skeletal muscles contract
and relax throughout the ride.
You know that you are moving at high
speeds because your eyes see the surroundings

move past at high speed. So, designers make
use of the surrounding
landscape along with
twists, turns, tunnels,

and loops to give the

rider plenty of visual
cues. These visual cues,

along with the mes-
sages from the inner
ear, can result in dis-

orientation and in
some cases, nausea. 

To 
enthusiasts the disorientation is part
of the thrill.In order to attractvisitors, amusement

parks are constantlyworking on designing new 
rides that take therider to new thrill levels. As roller-coaster 

technology improves, your most thrilling 
roller-coaster ride may be over the next hill.
1.Compare and Contrast
Compare andcontrast your experience as a rider inthe front of a roller coaster versus the
back of it. Explain your answer in terms
of the forces acting on you.
2.Critical Thinking
While older roller
coasters rely on chain systems to pull
the coaster up the first hill, newer ones

depend on hydraulic systems to do the
same job. Research each of these two

systems. What do you think are the

advantages and disadvantages of using

each system?Going Further
The thrill of a roller-coaster ride is produced by the forces
acting on the rider and the riderÕs reaction to visual cues.

¥The force that must be exerted on an object to cause it to be in equilibrium
is called the equilibrant. ¥The equilibrant is found by finding the net force on an object, then applying

a force with the same magnitude but opposite direction. ¥An object on an inclined plane has a component of the force of gravity in 

a direction parallel to the plane; the component can accelerate the object
down the plane.

MythologySisyphus was a character in Greek
mythology who was doomed in Hades to push 
a boulder to the top of a steep mountain. When 
he reached the top, the boulder would slide back

down the mountain and he would have to start 

all over again. Assume that Sisyphus slides the

boulder up the mountain without being able to
roll it, even though in most versions of the myth,

he rolled it.a.If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the

boulder and the mountainside is 0.40, the mass
of the boulder is 20.0 kg, and the slope of the

mountain is a constant 30.0
°, what is the forcethat Sisyphus must exert on the boulder to

move it up the mountain at a constant velocity?
b.If Sisyphus pushes the boulder at a velocity of

0.25 m/s and it takes him 8.0 h to reach the top
of the mountain, what is the mythical

mountainÕs vertical height?

or stay the same?
Critical Thinking
Describe the motion of a
horizontally launched projectile.
6.1Projectile MotionObjectives
¥Recognizethat the vertical
and horizontal motions of a
projectile are independent. ¥Relatethe height, time inthe air, and initial vertical

velocity of a projectile using
its vertical motion, and 

then determine the range
using the horizontal motion. 
¥Explainhow the trajectoryof a projectile depends
upon the frame of reference
from which it is observed.Vocabulary
projectiletrajectoryIf you observed the movement of a golf ball being hit from a tee, a frog
hopping, or a free throw being shot with a basketball, you would
notice that all of these objects move through the air along similar paths, 

as do baseballs, arrows, and bullets. Each path is a curve that moves

upward for a distance, and then, after a time, turns and moves downward

for some distance. You may be familiar with this curve, called a parabola,

from math class.
An object shot through the air is called a projectile.
A projectile can bea football, a bullet, or a drop of water. After a projectile is launched, what
forces are exerted on the projectile? You can draw a free-body diagram of a

launched projectile and identify all the forces that are acting on it. No matter
what the object is, after a projectile has been given an initial thrust, if you

ignore air resistance, it moves through the air only under the force of gravity.

The force of gravity is what causes the object to curve downward in a para-

bolic flight path. Its path through space is called its trajectory.
If you know
the force of the initial thrust on a projectile, you can calculate its trajectory.

Think about two softball players warming up for a game, tossing a ball
back and forth. What does the path of the ball through the air look like? Itlooks like a parabola, as you just learned. Imagine that you are standing

directly behind one of the players and you are watching the softball as it is

being tossed. What would the motion of the ball look like? You would see

it go up and back down, just like any object that is tossed straight up in the

air. If you were watching the softball from a hot-air balloon high above the

field, what motion would you see then? You would see the ball move from

one player to the other at a constant speed, just like any object that is given

an initial horizontal velocity, such as a hockey puck sliding across ice. The

motion of projectiles is a combination of these two motions.
Why do projectiles behave in this way? After a softball leaves a playerÕs
hand, what forces are exerted on the ball? If you ignore air resistance, there

are no contact forces on the ball. There is only the field force of gravity in

the downward direction. How does this affect the ballÕs motion? Gravity

causes the ball to have a downward acceleration. 
Figure 6-1shows the trajectories of two softballs. One was dropped 
and the other was given an initial horizontal velocity of 2.0 m/s. What is

similar about the two paths? Look at their vertical positions. During each

flash from the strobe light, the heights of the two softballs are the same.

Because the change in vertical position is the same for both, their average

vertical velocities during each interval are also the same. The increasingly

large distance traveled vertically by the softballs, from one time interval to

the next, shows that they are accelerated downward due to the force of

gravity. Notice that the horizontal motion of the launched ball does not

affect its vertical motion. A projectile launched horizontally has no initial

vertical velocity. Therefore, its vertical motion is like that of an object

dropped from rest. The downward velocity increases regularly because of

the acceleration due to gravity.

The ball on the right was given an initial horizontal velocity. The ball on 
the left was dropped at the same time from rest. Note that the vertical positions of the

(b),the resultant vectors are
tangent to a parabola.
Motion in Two Dimensions
Projectile motion in two dimensions can be determined by breaking the problem into 
two connected one-dimensional problems.
1.Divide the projectile motion into a vertical motion problem and a horizontal
motion problem. 2.The vertical motion of a projectile is exactly that of an object dropped or thrown

straight up or straight down. A gravitational force acts on the object and

accelerates it by an amount, 
g. Review Section 3.3 on free fall to refresh 
your problem-solving skills for vertical motion.
3.Analyzing the horizontal motion of a projectile is the same as solving a constant

velocity problem. No horizontal force acts on a projectile when drag due to air

resistance is neglected. Consequently, there are no forces acting in the horizontal

direction and therefore, no horizontal acceleration; 
ax0.0 m/s. To solve, use 
the same methods that you learned in Section 2.4.
4.Vertical motion and horizontal motion are connected through the variable of time.

The time from the launch of the projectile to the time it hits the target is the

same for both vertical motion and horizontal motion. Therefore, solving for time

in one of the dimensions, vertical or horizontal, automatically gives you time for

the other dimension.Separate motion diagrams for the horizontal and vertical motions are
shown in 
Figure 6-2a.The vertical-motion diagram represents the motion
of the dropped ball. The horizontal-motion diagram shows the constant
velocity in the 
x-direction of the launched ball. This constant velocity in
the horizontal direction is exactly what should be expected because there
is no horizontal force acting on the ball.In Figure 6-2b,
the horizontal and vertical components are added to
form the total velocity vector for the projectile. You can see how the com-

bination of constant horizontal velocity and uniform vertical acceleration

produces a trajectory that has a parabolic shape.

counter is kept very well polished for this purpose.) If the servers catch the sundaes 7.0 cm

from the edge of the counter, how far do they fall from the edge of the counter to the point

at which the servers catch them?

Projectiles Launched at an Angle
When a projectile is launched at an angle, the initial velocity has a 
vertical component, as well as a horizontal component. If the object is
launched upward, like a ball tossed straight up in the air, it rises with slow-

ing speed, reaches the top of its path, and descends with increasing speed.
Figure 6-3ashows the separate vertical- and horizontal-motion diagrams
for the trajectory. In the coordinate system, the positive 
x-axis is horizon-tal and the positive 
y-axis is vertical. Note the symmetry. At each point in
the vertical direction, the velocity of the object as it is moving upward has

the same magnitude as when it is moving downward. The only difference

is that the directions of the two velocities are opposite.
Figure 6-3bdefines two quantities associated with the trajectory. One
is the maximum height, which is the height of the projectile when the 
vertical velocity is zero and the projectile has only its horizontal-velocity

component. The other quantity depicted is the range, 
R, which is the hor-izontal distance that the projectile travels. Not shown is the flight time,

which is how much time the projectile is in the air. For football punts,

flight time often is called hang time.

Trajectories Depend upon the Viewer
Suppose you toss a ball up and catch it while riding in a bus. To you, the
ball would seem to go straight up and straight down. But what would an
observer on the sidewalk see? The observer would see the ball leave your

hand, rise up, and return to your hand, but because the bus would be mov-

ing, your hand also would be moving. The bus, your hand, and the ball

would all have the same horizontal velocity. Thus, the trajectory of the 

ball would be similar to that of the ball in Example Problem 1. 
Air resistance
So far, air resistance has been 
ignored in the analysis of
projectile motion. While the effects of air resistance are very small for some
projectiles, for others, the effects are large and complex. For example, dimples
on a golf ball reduce air resistance and maximize its range. In baseball, the

spin of the ball creates forces that can deflect the ball. For now, just remem-

ber that the force due to air resistance does exist and it can be important.Trajectory

6.2Circular Motionr1r2rr1v1v2r2Figure 6-5
The displacement,
r, of an object in circular motion,divided by the time interval inwhich the displacement occurs, 
is the objectÕs average velocityduring that time interval.Section 6.2Circular Motion
153abFigure 6-6
The direction of the
change in velocity is toward thecenter of the circle, and so the
acceleration vector also points 

to the center of the circle.abConsider an object moving in a circle at a constant speed, such as a
stone being whirled on the end of a string or a fixed horse on amerry-go-round. Are these objects accelerating? At first, you might think
that they are not because their speeds do not change. However, remember

that acceleration is the change in velocity, not just the change in speed.

Because their direction is changing, the objects must be accelerating.Describing Circular Motion
Uniform circular motionis the movement of an object or particle tra-
jectory at a constant speed around a circle with a fixed radius. The positions
of an object in uniform circular motion, relative to the center of the circle,
are given by the position vectors 
r1and r2, shown in 
Figure 6-5a.As theobject moves around the circle, the length of each position vector does not
change, but its direction does. To find the objectÕs velocity, you need to

find its displacement vector over a time interval. The change in position,

or the objectÕs displacement, is represented by 
r. Figure 6-5bshows two
position vectors: 
r1at the beginning of a time interval, and 
r2at the end ofthe time interval. Remember that a position vector is a displacement vec-

tor with its tail at the origin. In the vector diagram, 
r1and r2are subtractedto give the resultant 
r, the displacement during the time interval. You
know that a moving objectÕs average velocity is 
d/t, so for an object incircular motion,vr/t. The velocity vector has the same direction as
the displacement, but a different length. You can see in 
Figure 6-6athatthe velocity is at right angles to the position vector, which is tangent to its 

circular path. As the velocity vector moves around the circle, its direction

changes but its length remains the same.
What is the direction of the objectÕs acceleration? Figure 6-6a shows the
velocity vectors 
v1and v2at the beginning and end of a time interval. The
difference in the two vectors, 
v, is found by subtracting the vectors, as
shown in 
Figure 6-6b.
The average acceleration, 
av/t, is in the samedirection as v; that is, toward the center of the circle. Repeat this process
for several other time intervals when the object is in different locations on

the circle. As the object moves around the circle, the direction of the accel-

eration vector changes, but its length remains the same. Notice that the

acceleration vector of an object in uniform circular motion always points

in toward the center of the circle. For this reason, the acceleration of such

an object is called center-seeking or centripetal acceleration.153-156 CH06-S2-845813  6/1/04  5:24 AM  Page 153154Chapter 6Motion in Two Dimensions
Centripetal Acceleration 
What is the magnitude of an objectÕs centripetal acceleration? Compare
the triangle made from the position vectors in Figure 6-5b with the trian-
gle made by the velocity vectors in Figure 6-6b. The angle between 
r1andr2is the same as that between 
v1and v2. Therefore, the two triangles
formed by subtracting the two sets of vectors are similar triangles, and 

the ratios of the lengths of two corresponding sides are equal. Thus, 

r/rv/v. The equation is not changed if both sides are divided by 
t.rrtvvtHowever, 
vr/tand av/t.1rrt1vvtSubstituting vr/tin the left-hand side and av/tin the right-handside gives the following equation.
vravSolve this equation for acceleration and give it the special symbol 
ac, forcentripetal acceleration. How can you measure the speed of an object moving in a circle? One
way is to measure its period, 
T, the time needed for the object to make onecomplete revolution. During this time, the object travels a distance equal

to the circumference of the circle, 2
r. The objectÕs speed, then, is repre-
sented by 
v2r/T. If this expression is substituted for vin the equationfor centripetal acceleration, the following equation is obtained.
ac4T22rBecause the acceleration of an object moving in a circle is always in the
direction of the net force acting on it, there must be a net force toward the

center of the circle. This force can be provided by any number of agents.

For Earth circling the Sun, the force is the SunÕs gravitational force on

Earth, as youÕll learn in Chapter 7. When a hammer thrower swings the

hammer, as in 
Figure 6-7,the force is the tension in the chain attached tothe massive ball. When an object moves in a circle, the net force toward the

center of the circle is called the centripetal force.
To accurately analyze
centripetal acceleration situations, you must identify the agent of the force

that causes the acceleration. Then you can apply NewtonÕs second law for

the component in the direction of the acceleration in the following way.
NewtonÕs Second Law for Circular Motion
FnetmacThe net centripetal force on an object moving in a circle is equal to the
objectÕs mass, times the centripetal acceleration.
2Tr2rCentripetal Acceleration
acvr2Centripetal acceleration always points to the center of the circle. Its magnitude

is equal to the square of the speed, divided by the radius of motion.Figure 6-7
When the thrower
lets go, the hammer initially moves
in a straight line that is tangent 

to the point of release. Then it

follows a trajectory like that of 
any object released into the air 
with an initial horizontal velocity.
Space Elevators

areconsidering the use of 
space elevators as a low-cost
transportation system to space. 

A cable would be anchored to 

a station at EarthÕs equator, and 

the cable would extend almost

35,800 km from EarthÕs surface.

The cable would be attached to 

a counterweight and would stay

extended due to centripetal force.

Special magnetically powered

vehicles would then travel along

the cable.

¥Are the magnitudes realistic?
The force is almost three times the weight of the
stopper, and the acceleration is almost three times that of gravity, which is reasonable

for such a light object.321When solving problems, you have found it useful to choose a coordi-
nate system with one axis in the direction of the acceleration. For circular
motion, the direction of the acceleration is always toward the center of the

circle. Rather than labeling this axis 
xor y, call it c, for centripetal accelera-tion. The other axis is in the direction of the velocity, tangent to the circle.

It is labeled tangfor tangential. You will apply NewtonÕs second law in
these directions, just as you did in the two-dimensional problems in

Chapter 5. Remember that centripetal force is just another name for the

net force in the centripetal direction. It is the sum of all the real forces,

those for which you can identify agents that act along the centripetal axis. 
In the case of the hammer thrower in Figure 6-7, in what direction does
the hammer fly when the chain is released? Once the contact force of the
chain is gone, there is no force accelerating the hammer toward the center

of the circle, so the hammer flies off in the direction of its velocity, which

is tangent to the circle. Remember, if you cannot identify the agent of the

force, then it does not exist.

the platform? A Nonexistent Force
If a car makes a sharp left turn, a passenger on the right side might bethrown against the right door. Is there an outward force on the passenger?
Consider a similar situation. If a car in which you are riding stops suddenly,

you will be thrown forward into your safety belt. Is there a forward force

on you? No, because according to NewtonÕs first law, you will continue

moving with the same velocity unless there is a net force acting on you.

The safety belt applies the force that accelerates you to a stop. 
Figure 6-8shows a car turning to the left as viewed from above. A passenger in the car

would continue to move straight ahead if it were not for the force of the

door acting in the direction of the acceleration; that is, toward the center

of the circle. Thus, there is no outward force on the passenger. The so-

called centrifugal, or outward force, is a fictitious, nonexistent force.

NewtonÕs laws are able to explain motion in both straight lines and circles.
153-156 CH06-S2-845813  3/21/04  9:27 PM  Page 156Suppose that you are in a school bus that is traveling at a velocity of 
8 m/s in a positive direction. You walk with a velocity of 3 m/s toward
the front of the bus. If a friend of yours is standing on the side of the road

watching the bus with you on it go by, how fast would your friend say that

you are moving? If the bus is traveling at 8 m/s, this means that the veloc-

ity of the bus is 8 m/s, as measured by your friend in a coordinate system

fixed to the road. When you are standing still, your velocity relative to the

road is also 8 m/s, but your velocity relative to the bus is zero. Walking at

3 m/s toward the front of the bus means that your velocity is measured 

relative to the bus. The problem can be rephrased as follows: Given the

velocity of the bus relative to the road and your velocity relative to the bus,

what is your velocity relative to the road?
A vector representation of this problem is shown in 
Figure 6-9a.Afterstudying it, you will find that your velocity relative to the street is 11 m/s,

the sum of 8 m/s and 3 m/s. Suppose that you now walk at the same 

speed toward the rear of the bus. What would be your velocity relative 

to the road? Figure 6-9bshows that because the two velocities are in
opposite directions, the resultant velocity is 5 m/s, the difference between

8 m/s and 3 m/s. You 
can see that when the velocities are along the 
same line, simple addition or subtraction can be used to determine the 

relative velocity.
Take a closer look at how these results were obtained and see if you 
can find a mathematical rule to describe how velocities are combined in

these relative-velocity situations. For the above situation, you can designate

the velocity of the bus relative to the road as 
vb/r, your velocity relative to
the bus as vy/b, and the velocity of you relative to the road as 
vy/r. To find
the velocity of you relative to the road in both cases, you vectorially added

the velocities of you relative to the bus and the bus relative to the road.

Mathematically, this is represented as 
vy/bvb/rvy/r. The more generalform of this equation is as follows.

¥Do the signs make sense?The signs should all be positive.
¥Are the magnitudes realistic?
The resulting velocity is of the same order of
magnitude as the velocities given in the problem.
321This method for adding relative velocities also applies to motion in two
dimensions. For example, airline pilots cannot expect to reach their desti-
nations by simply aiming their planes along a compass direction. They

must take into account the planeÕs speed relative to the air, which is given

by their airspeed indicators, and their direction of flight relative to the air.

They also must consider the velocity of the wind at the altitude they are fly-

ing relative to the ground. These two vectors must be combined, as shown

in Figure 6-10
, to obtain the velocity of the airplane relative to the ground.
The resultant vector tells the pilot how fast and in what direction the plane

must travel relative to the ground to reach its destination. A similar situa-

tion occurs for boats traveling on water with a flowing current.

75 km/hto the 
east relative to the ground. What is the planeÕs speed relative to the
ground? Another example of combined relative velocities is the navigation of
migrating neotropical songbirds. In addition to knowing in which direction
to fly, a bird must account for its speed relative to the air and its direction

relative to the ground. If a bird tries to fly over the Gulf of Mexico into too

strong a headwind, it will run out of energy before it reaches the other shore
and will perish. Similarly, the bird must account for crosswinds or it will not

reach its destination. You can add relative velocities even if they are at arbi-

trary angles by using the graphical methods that you learned in Chapter 5.
Remember that the key to properly analyzing a two-dimensional rela-
tive-velocity situation is drawing the proper triangle to represent the three

velocities. Once you have this triangle, you simply apply your knowledge

of vector addition from Chapter 5. If the situation contains two velocities

that are perpendicular to each other, you can find the third by applying the

Pythagorean theorem; however, if the situation has no right angles, you

will need to use one or both of the laws of sines and cosines.

Spinning Space StationsSpinning Space StationsThere is a lot going on
aboard theInternational Space Station(ISS). Scientists fromdifferent countries are conducting experimentsand making observations. They have seen water

drops form as floating spheres and have grown

peas in space to test whether crops can be
grown in weightlessness.
One goal of the ISS is to examine the effectson the human body when living in space for
prolonged periods of time. If negative health

effects can be identified, perhaps they can be
prevented. This could give humans the option 

of living in space for long periods of time.
Harmful effects of weightlessness have been
observed. On Earth, muscles have gravity to
push and pull against. Muscles weaken from

disuse if this resistance is removed. Bones can

weaken for the same reason. Also, blood volume

can decrease. On Earth, gravity pulls blood

downward so 
it collects in the lower legs. In
weightlessness, the blood can more easily collect

in an astronautÕs head. The brain senses the extra

blood and sends a signal to make less of it.Long-term life in space is hindered by the
practical challenges of weightlessness as well.

Imagine how daily life would change. Everything

must be strapped or bolted down. You would

have to be strapped down to a bed to sleep in

one. Your life would be difficult in a space sta-

tion unless the space 
station could be modifiedto simulate gravity. How could this be done? 
The Rotating Space Station
Have you
ever been on a human centrifugeÑa type of
amusement park ride that uses centripetal force?
Everyone stands against the walls of a big cylin-

der. Then the cylinder begins to rotate faster

and faster until the riders are pressed against
the walls. Because of the centripetal acceleration,

the riders are held there so that even when the

floor drops down they are held securely against

the walls of the whirling container. 
A space station could be designed that usesthe effects of centripetal motion as a replace-ment for gravity. Imagine a space station in 

the form of a large ring. The space station and
all the objects and occupants inside would

float weightlessly inside. If the ring were made

to spin, unattached objects would be held

against the ringÕs outer edge because of the

centripetal motion. If the space station spun at the right rate and if it had the right diameter,

the centripetal motion would cause the 

occupants to experience a force of the same
magnitude as gravity. The down direction in

the space station would be what an observer

outside the station would see as radially 

outward, away from the ringÕs center. 
Centripetal acceleration is directly propor-tional to the distance from the center of a
rotating object. A rotating space station could be
built in the form of concentric rings, each ring

experiencing a different gravity
.The innermostrings would experience the smallest gravity,

while outermost rings would experience the

largest force. You could go from floating 

peacefully in a low-gravity ring to standing

securely in the simulated Earth-gravity ring.

Key Concepts
¥The vertical and horizontal motions of a projectile are independent.
¥The vertical motion component of a projectile experiences a constant
acceleration.¥When there is no air resistance, the horizontal motion component does not

experience an acceleration and has constant velocity.
¥Projectile problems are solved by first using the vertical motion to relate

height, time in the air, and initial vertical velocity. Then the distance traveled

horizontally is found. ¥The range of a projectile depends upon the acceleration due to gravity and

upon both components of the initial velocity.
¥The curved flight path that is followed by a projectile is called a parabola.
Key Concepts
¥An object moving in a circle at a constant speed accelerates toward the center

of the circle, and therefore, it has centripetal acceleration.
¥Centripetal acceleration depends directly on the square of the objectÕs speed

and inversely on the radius of the circle. 
¥The centripetal acceleration for an object traveling in a circle can also be

expressed as a function of its period, T.¥A net force must be exerted toward the circleÕs center to cause centripetal

acceleration. ¥The velocity vector of an object with a centripetal acceleration is al

of the gases relative to the observer? 
77.Two dogs, initially separated by 500.0 m, are

running towards each other, each moving with a

constant speed of 2.5 m/s. A dragonfly, moving 

with a constant speed of 3.0 m/s, flies from the

the posted speed limit for a particular curve of

radius 36.0 m is 15.7 m/s (35 mph), at what angle
should the road be banked so that cars will stay 

on a circular path even if there were no friction

between the road and the tires? If the speed limit

was increased to 20.1 m/s (45 mph), at what angle

should the road be banked?80.The 1.45-kg ball in Figure 6-17is suspended froma 0.80-m string and swung in a horizontal circle

Meanwhile, Shifty runs to the convenient hot-air

balloon 20.0 m from the base of the building and

untethers it, so it begins to rise at a constant speed.

through the loop inuniform circular motion?
Explain. 84.Use NumbersA 3-point jump shot is released 2.2 m above the ground and 6.02 m from the

basket. The basket is 3.05 m above the floor. For

launch angles of 30
°and 60°, find the speed theball needs to be thrown to make the basket. 
85.AnalyzeFor which angle in problem 84 is it more
important that the player get the speed right? To

explore this question, vary the speed at each angle

by 5 percent and find the change in the range of the

attempted shot. 86.Apply Computers and CalculatorsA baseballplayer hits a belt-high (1.0 m) fastball down the

left-field line. The ball is hit with an initial velocity

of 42.0 m/s at 26°. The left-field wall is 96.0 m
from home plate at the foul pole and is 14-m high.
Write the equation for the height of the ball, 
y, as afunction of its distance from home plate, 
x. Use acomputer or graphing calculator to plot the path 
of the ball. Trace along the path to find how high

above the ground the ball is when it is at the wall.
a.Is the hit a home run? b.What is the minimum speed at which the ball
could be hit and clear the wall?
c.If the initial velocity of the ball is 42.0 m/s, for

what range of angles will the ball go over the wall?
87.AnalyzeAlbert Einstein showed that the rule you
learned for the addition of velocities does not work

for objects moving near the speed of light. For

example, if a rocket moving at velocity 
vAreleases amissile that has velocity 
vBrelative to the rocket,
then the velocity of the missile relative to an observer

that is at rest is given by 
v(vAvB)/(1vAvB/c2),where cis the speed of light, 3.00108m/s. This
formula gives the correct values for objects moving

at slow speeds as well. Suppose a rocket moving 

at 11 km/s shoots a laser beam out in front of it.

What speed would an unmoving observer find for

the laser light? Suppose that a rocket moves at a

speed c/2, half the speed of light, and shoots amissile forward at a speed of 
c/2 relative to the
rocket. How fast would the missile be moving

relative to a fixed observer?

motion of this system. Be sure to consider the

effects of gravity and tension. Is this system in

uniform circular motion? Explain your answer.

on roller coasters, you will notice that most of them

are not circular in shape. Research why this is so

and explain the physics behind this decision by the

coaster engineers.

QuestionDo planets in our solar system have circular orbits or do they travel in some other path?
Section 7.1Planetary Motion and Gravitation
171Since ancient times, the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars had been
assumed to revolve around Earth. Nicholas Copernicus, a Polish
astronomer, noticed that the best available observations of the movements

of planets and stars did not fully agree with the Earth-centered model. The
results of his many years of work were published in 1543, when

Copernicus was on his deathbed. His book showed that the motion of

planets is much more easily understood by assuming that Earth and other

planets revolve around the Sun.
Tycho Brahe was born a few years after the death of Copernicus. As a boy
of 14 in Denmark, Brahe observed an eclipse of the Sun on August 21,

1560, and vowed to become an astronomer.
Brahe studied astronomy as he traveled throughout Europe for five
years. He did not use telescopes. Instead, he used huge instruments that 

he designed and built in his own shop on the Danish island of Hven. He

spent the next 20 years carefully recording the exact positions of the planets

and stars. Brahe concluded that the Sun and the Moon orbit Earth and that

all other planets orbit the Sun.7.1Planetary Motion and Gravitation

Kepler’s Laws
Johannes Kepler, a 29-year-old German, became one of BraheÕs assistants
when he moved to Prague. Brahe trained his assistants to use instruments,

such as those shown in 
Figure 7-1.Upon his death in 1601, Kepler inher-
ited 30 yearsÕ worth of BraheÕs observations. He studied BraheÕs data and was

convinced that geometry and mathematics could be used to explain the
number, distance, and motion of the planets. Kepler believed that the Sun

exerted a force on the planets and placed the Sun at the center of the system.

After several years of careful analysis of BraheÕs data on Mars, Kepler discov-

ered the laws that describe the motion of every planet and satellite.
KeplerÕs first law
states that the paths of the planets are ellipses, with
the Sun at one focus. An ellipse has two foci, as shown in 
Figure 7-2.Likeplanets and stars, comets also orbit the Sun in elliptical orbits. Comets are

divided into two groupsÑlong-period comets and short-period cometsÑ

based on orbital periods, each of which is the time it takes the comet to

complete one revolution.Long-period comets have orbital periods longer

than 200 years, and short-period comets have orbital periods shorter than

200 years. Comet Hale-Bopp, with a period of 2400 years, is an example

of a long-period comet. Comet Halley, with a period of 76 years, is an

example of a short-period comet.abcNewberry Library/Stock Montage170-178 CH07 S1-845813  3/5/04  12:05 PM  Page 172Kepler found that the planets
move faster when they are closer to
the Sun and slower when they 

are farther away from the Sun. Thus,

KeplerÕs second law
states that animaginary line from the Sun to a
planet sweeps out equal areas in

equal time intervals, as illustrated in

Figure 7-3.Kepler also found that there is a
mathematical relationship between

periods of planets and their mean
distances away from the Sun.

KeplerÕs third law
states that thesquare of the ratio of the periods of
any two plan
ets revolving about the Sun is equal to the cube of the ratio of
their average distances from the Sun. Thus, if the periods of the planets are

TAand TB, and their average distances from the Sun are 
rAand rB, KeplerÕs
third law can be expressed as follows. 
Note that the first two laws apply to each planet, moon, and satellite
individually. The third law, however, relates the motion of several objects

about a single body. For example, it can be used to compare the planetsÕ

distances from the Sun, shown in 
Table 7-1,
to their periods about theSun. It also can be used to compare distances and periods of the Moon and
artificial satellites orbiting Earth.KeplerÕs Third Law
TTAB2rrAB3The squared quantity of the period of object A divided by the period of object B,
is equal to the cubed quantity of object AÕs average distance from the Sun,

divided by object BÕs average distance from the Sun.

175Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
In 1666, 45 years after Kepler published his work, Newton began his
studies of planetary motion. He found that the magnitude of the force, 
F,on a planet due to the Sun varies inversely with the square of the distance, 
r,between the centers of the planet and the Sun. That is, 
Fis proportional to 1/r2. The force, 
F,acts in the direction of the line connecting the centersof the two objects.
It is quoted that the sight of a falling apple made Newton wonder if the
force that caused the apple to fall might extend to the Moon, or even
beyond. He found that both the apple's and MoonÕs accelerations agreed

with the 1/r2relationship. According to his own third law, the force Earth
exerts on the apple is exactly the same as the force the apple exerts on
Earth. The force of attraction between two objects must be proportional to

the objectsÕ masses, and is known as the 
gravitational force.
Newton was confident that the same force of attraction would act
between any two objects, anywhere in the universe. He proposed his 
law
of universal gravitation,
which states that objects attract other objectswith a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This

can be represented by the following equation. 
According to NewtonÕs equation, 
Fis directly proportional to m1andm2. Thus, if the mass of a planet near the Sun were doubled, the force of
attraction would be doubled. Use the Connecting Math to Physics feature

below to examine how changing one variable affects another. 
Figure 7-4illustrates the inverse square law graphically.

2.Find the mass of the star Upsilon Andromedae in units of the

Newton stated his law of universal gravitation in terms that applied to
the motion of planets about the Sun. This agreed with KeplerÕs third law
and confirmed that NewtonÕs law fit the best observations of the day.
Consider a planet orbiting the Sun, as shown in 
Figure 7-5.NewtonÕs
second law of motion, 
Fnetma, can be written as Fnetmpac, where Fisthe gravitational force, 
mpis the mass of the planet, and acis the centripetalacceleration of the planet. For simplicity, assume circular orbits. Recall

from your study of uniform circular motion in Chapter 6 that, for a circular

orbit, ac42r/T2. This means that Fnetmpacmay now be written as 
Fnetmp42r/T2. In this equation, Tis the time required for the planet tomake one complete revolution about the Sun. If you set the right side of

this equation equal to the right side of the law of universal gravitation, you

arrive at the following result:
GmSr2mpmpT422rT2G4m2Sr3Thus, 
TG4m2Sr3The period of a planet orbiting the Sun can be expressed as follows.
Squaring both sides makes it apparent that this equation is KeplerÕs
third law of planetary motion: the square of the period is proportional to

the cube of the distance that separates the masses. The factor 4
2/GmSdepends on the mass of the Sun and the universal gravitational constant.

Newton found that this derivation applied to elliptical orbits as well.
Period of a Planet Orbiting the Sun

When the large lead spheres are placed near the small lead
spheres, the gravitational attraction between the spheres causes the rod to
rotate. The rotation is measured with the help of the reflected light ray.
Measuring the Universal Gravitational Constant
How large is the constant, 
G? As you know, the force of gravitational
attraction between two objects on Earth is relatively small. The slightest
attraction, even between two massive bowling balls, is difficult to detect. In

fact, it took 100 years from the time of NewtonÕs work for scientists to

develop an apparatus that was sensitive enough to measure the force of

gravitational attraction. 
CavendishÕs experiment
In 1798, Englishman Henry Cavendish used
equipment similar to the apparatus shown in 
Figure 7-6to measure thegravitational force between two objects. The apparatus had a horizontal
rod with two small lead spheres attached to each end. The rod was 

suspended at its midpoint by a thin wire so that it could rotate. Because the

rod was suspended by a thin wire, the rod and spheres were very sensitive

to horizontal forces. To measure 
G, Cavendish placed two large lead
spheres in a fixed position, close to each of the two small spheres, as

shown in 
Figure 7-7.The force of attraction between the large and the
small spheres caused the rod to rotate. When the force required to twist the

wire equaled the gravitational force between the spheres, the rod stopped

rotating. By measuring the angle through which the rod turned, Cavendish

was able to calculate the attractive force between the objects. The angle

through which the rod turned is measured using the beam of light that 
is reflected from the mirror. He measured the masses of the spheres and

the distance between their centers. Substituting these values for force,

mass, and distance into NewtonÕs law of universal gravitation, he found an

experimental value for 
G: when m1and m2are measured in kilograms, 
rinmeters, and 
Fin newtons, then 
G6.671011Nm2/kg2.Section 7.1Planetary Motion and Gravitation

value of 
Gis known, not only the mass of Earth, but also the mass of the
Sun can be determined. In addition, the gravitational force between any

two objects can be calculated using NewtonÕs law of universal gravitation.

For example, the attractive gravitational force, 
Fg, between two bowling
balls of mass 7.26 kg, with their centers separated by 0.30 m, can be 

calculated as follows:

179The planet Uranus was discovered in 1781. By 1830, it was clear that
the law of gravitation didnÕt correctly predict its orbit. Two astronomers
proposed that Uranus was being attracted by the Sun and by an undiscovered
planet. They calculated the orbit of such a planet in 1845, and, one year
later, astronomers at the Berlin Observatory found the planet now called
Neptune. How do planets, such as Neptune, orbit the Sun?
Orbits of Planets and Satellites
Newton used a drawing similar to the one shown in 
Figure 7-9to illus-trate a thought experiment on the motion of satellites. Imagine a cannon,
perched high atop a mountain, firing a cannonball horizontally with agiven horizontal speed. The cannonball is a projectile, and its motion has
both vertical and horizontal components. Like all projectiles on Earth, it
would follow a parabolic trajectory and fall back to the ground.
If the cannonballÕs horizontal speed were increased, it would travel 
farther across the surface of Earth, and still fall back to the ground. If anextremely powerful cannon were used, however, the cannonball would
travel all the way around Earth, and keep going. It would fall toward Earth
at the same rate that EarthÕs surface curves away. In other words, the cur-
vature of the projectile would continue to just match the curvature of
Earth, so that the cannonball would never get any closer or farther away
from EarthÕs curved surface. The cannonball would, therefore, be in orbit. 
NewtonÕs thought experiment ignored air resistance. For the cannonball
to be free of air resistance, the mountain on which the cannon is perched
would have to be more than 150km above EarthÕs surface. By way of com-
parison, the mountain would have to be much taller than the peak of
Mount Everest, the worldÕs tallest mountain, which is only 8.85km in
height. A cannonball launched from a mountain that is 150 km above
EarthÕs surface would encounter little or no air resistance at an altitude of
150 km, because the mountain would be above most of the atmosphere.
Thus, a cannonball or any object or satellite at or above this altitude could
orbit Earth for a long time.
179-185 CH07 S2-845813  3/5/04  11:55 AM  Page 179A satellite in an orbit that is always the same height above Earth moves
in uniform circular motion. Recall that its centripetal acceleration is given
by 
acv2/r. NewtonÕs second law, 
Fnetmac, can thus be rewritten as Fnetmv2/r. If EarthÕs mass is 
mE, then this expression combined withNewtonÕs law of universal gravitation produces the following equation:
GmrE2mmrv2Solving for the speed of a satellite in circular orbit about Earth, v,yields thefollowing. 
A satelliteÕs orbital periodA satelliteÕs orbit around Earth is similar to a
planetÕs orbit about the Sun. Recall that the period of a planet orbiting the
Sun is expressed by the following equation: 
T2Grm3SThus, the period for a satellite orbiting Earth is given by the following

equation.The equations for the speed and period of a satellite can be used for any
object in orbit about another. The mass of the central body will replace 
mEin the equations, and 
rwill be the distance between the centers of the
orbiting body and the central body. If the mass of the central body is much

greater than the mass of the orbiting body, then 
ris equal to the distancebetween the centers of the orbiting body and the central body. Orbital

speed, v,and period, T, 
are independent of the mass of the satellite. Are
there any factors that limit the mass of a satellite? 
A satelliteÕs massLandsat 7,shown in 
Figure 7-10,
is an artificial satel-lite that provides images of EarthÕs continental surfaces. 
Landsatimageshave been used to create maps, study land use, and monitor resources 
and global changes. The 
Landsat 7system enables researchers to monitor
small-scale processes, such as deforestation, on a global scale. Satellites,

such as Landsat 7,are accelerated to the speeds necessary for them toachieve orbit by large rockets, such as shuttle-booster rockets. Because the

acceleration of any mass must follow NewtonÕs second law of motion, 

Fnetma,more force is required to launch a more massive satellite into
orbit. Thus, the mass of a satellite is limited by the capability of the rocket

used to launch it.Period of a Satellite Orbiting Earth

aGa grrE2This shows that as you move farther from EarthÕs center, that is, as 
rbecomes larger, the acceleration due to gravity is reduced according to this

inverse square relationship. What happens to your weight, 
mg, as you move
farther and farther from EarthÕs center?
Weight and weightlessness
You probably have seen photos similar to
the one in Figure 7-11 
in which astronauts are on the space shuttle in an environment often called Òzero-gÓ or Òweightlessness.Ó The shuttle
orbits about 400 km above EarthÕs surface. At that distance, 
g8.7 m/s2,only slightly less than on EarthÕs surface. Thus, EarthÕs gravitational force is 
certainly not zero in the shuttle. In fact, gravity causes the shuttle to orbit

Earth. Why, then, do the astronauts appear to have no weight? 
Remember that you sense weight when something, such as the floor
or your chair, exerts a contact force on you. But if you, your chair, and

the floor all are accelerating toward Earth together, then no contact

forces are exerted on you. Thus, your apparent weight is zero and you

experience weightlessness. Similarly, the astronauts experience weight-

lessness as the shuttle and everything in it falls freely toward Earth.
The Gravitational Field
Recall from Chapter 6 that many common
forces are contact forces. Friction is exerted where

two objects touch, for example, when the floor

and your chair or desk push on you. Gravity, how-

ever, is different. It acts on an apple falling from a

tree and on the Moon in orbit. It even acts on you

in midair as you jump up or skydive. In other

words, gravity acts over a distance. It acts between

objects that are not touching or that are not close
together. Newton w
as puzzled by this concept. He
wondered how the Sun could exert a force on

planet Earth, which is hundreds of millions of
kilometers away.

An inertial balance
allows you to calculate the inertial
mass of an object from the period
(T) of the back-and-forth motion
of the object. Calibration masses,

such as the cylindrical ones

shown here, are used to create 
a graph of T2versus the mass.The period of the unknown mass

is then measured, and the inertial

mass is determined from the
calibration graph.
The answer to the puzzle arose from a study of magnetism. In the 19th
century, Michael Faraday developed the concept of a field to explain how

a magnet attracts objects. Later, the field concept was applied to gravity.

Any object with mass is surrounded by a 
gravitational field 
in whichanother object experiences a force due to the interaction between its mass

and the gravitational field, 
g, at its location. This is expressed by the fol-
lowing equation. 
Suppose the gravitational field is created by the Sun. Then a planet of
mass mhas a force exerted on it that depends on its mass and the magni-tude of the gravitational field at its location. That is, 
Fmg, toward the
Sun. The force is caused by the interaction of the planetÕs mass with the

gravitational field at its location, not with the Sun millions of kilometers

away. To 
find the gravitational field caused by more than one object you
would calculate both gravitational fields and add them as vectors.
The gravitational field can be measured by placing an object with a
small mass, 
m, in the gravitational field and measuring the force, 
F, on it.The gravitational field can be calculated using 
gF/m. The gravitational
field is measured in N/kg, which is also equal to m/s2. On EarthÕs surface, the strength of the gravitational field is 9.80 N/kg,
and its direction is toward EarthÕs center. The field can be represented by a

vector of length 
gpointing toward the center of the object producing the
field. You can picture the gravitational field of Earth as a collection of vec-

tors surrounding Earth and pointing toward it, as shown in 
Figure 7-12.The strength of the field varies inversely with the square of the distance

from the center of Earth. The gravitational field depends on EarthÕs mass,

but not on the mass of the object experiencing it. Two Kinds of Mass
Recall that when the concept of mass was discussed in Chapter 4, it was
defined as the slope of a graph of force versus acceleration. That is, mass is

equal to the ratio of the net force exerted on an object to its acceleration.
This kind of mass, related to the inertia of an object, is called 
inertial massand is represented by the following equation. 
The inertial mass of an object is measured by exerting a force on the object
and measuring the objectÕs acceleration using an inertial balance, such as the

one shown in 
Figure 7-13. The more inertial mass an object has, the less it
is affected by any forceÑthe less acceleration it undergoes. Thus, the inertial

mass of an object is a measure of the objectÕs resistance to any type of force.
Inertial MassminertialFnaetInertial mass is equal to the net force exerted on the object divided by the
acceleration of the object.Gravitational Field
gGrM2The gravitational field is equal to the universal gravitational constant times

the objectÕs mass, divided by the square of the distance from the objectÕs

center. The direction is toward the massÕs center.

Figure 7-15
Matter causes
space to curve just as an objecton a rubber sheet curves the

sheet around it. Moving objects

near the mass follow the curvature
of space. The red ball is moving

clockwise around the center mass.NewtonÕs law of universal gravitation, 
F = Gm1m2/r2, also involves mass,
but a different kind of mass. Mass as used in the law of universal gravita-

tion determines the size of the gravitational force between two objects and

is called gravitational mass.
It can be measured using a simple balance,
such as the one shown in 
Figure 7-14.If you measure the attractive force
exerted on an object by another object of mass, 
m,at a distance, 
r,then you
can define the gravitational mass in the following way.
How different are these two kinds of mass? Suppose you have a water-
melon in the trunk of your car. If you accelerate the car forward, the 

watermelon will roll backwards, relative to the trunk. This is a result of its

inertial massÑits resistance to acceleration. Now, suppose your car climbs

a steep hill at a constant speed. The watermelon will again roll backwards.

But this time, it moves as a result of its gravitational mass. The watermelon

is being attracted downward toward Earth. Newton made the claim that

inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal in magnitude. This hypoth-

esis is called the principle of equivalence. All experiments conducted so far

have yielded data that support this principle. Albert Einstein also was

intrigued by the principle of equivalence and made it a central point in his

theory of gravity.
Einstein’s Theory of Gravity
NewtonÕs law of universal gravitation allows us to calculate the gravita-
tional force that exists between two objects because of their masses. The

concept of a gravitational field allows us to picture the way gravity acts on

objects that are far away. Einstein proposed that gravity is not a force, but

rather, an effect of space itself. According to Einstein, mass changes the

space around it. Mass causes space to be curved, and other bodies are accel-

erated because of the way they follow this curved space.
Gravitational Mass

r2GFmgrav
The gravitational mass of an object is equal to the distance between the 
objects squared, times the gravitational force, divided by the product of the 

universal gravitational constant, times the mass of the other object.

179-185 CH07 S2-845813  3/5/04  12:00 PM  Page 184One way to picture how space is affected by mass is to compare space to
a large, two-dimensional rubber sheet, as shown in 
Figure 7-15.The yellow
ball on the sheet represents a massive object. It forms an indentation. A red
ball  rolling across the sheet simulates the motion of an object in space. If

the red ball moves near the sagging region of the sheet, it will be acceler-

ated. In the same way, Earth and the Sun are attracted to one another

because of the way space is distorted by the two objects.
EinsteinÕs theory, called the general theory of relativity, makes many 
predictions about how massive objects affect one another. In every test con-

ducted to 
date, EinsteinÕs theory has been shown to give the correct results.
Deflection of lightEinsteinÕs theory predicts the deflection or bending of
light by massive objects. Light follows the curvature of space around the

massive object and is deflected, as shown in 
Figure 7-16.In 1919, during
an eclipse of the Sun, astronomers found that light from distant stars that
passed near the Sun was deflected in agreement with EinsteinÕs predictions. 
Another result of general relativity is the effect on light from very mas-
sive objects. If an object is massive and dense enough, the light leaving it

will be totally bent back to the object. No light ever escapes the object.

Objects such as these, called black holes, have been identified as a result of

their effects on nearby stars. The radiation produced when matter is pulled

into black holes has also been helpful in their detection.While EinsteinÕs theory provides very accurate predictions of gravityÕs
effects, it is still incomplete. It does not explain the origin of mass or how

mass curves space. Physicists are working to understand the deeper mean-

ing of gravity and the origin of mass itself.

Safety PrecautionsObjectivesModeling the Orbits of Planets and SatellitesIn this experiment, you will analyze a model that will show how KeplerÕs first and
second laws of motion apply to orbits of objects in space. KeplerÕs first law states

that orbits of planets are ellipses, with the Sun at one focus. KeplerÕs second law

states that an imaginary line from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in

equal time intervals. 
The shape of the elliptical orbit is defined by eccentricity, 
e, which is the ratio ofthe distance between the foci to the length of the major axis. When an object is at
its farthest distance from the Sun along the major axis, it is at aphelion. When the

object is at its closest distance from the Sun along the major axis, it is at perihelion.

if you were to travel
to a black hole? Your body would be stretched,
flattened, and eventually pulled apart. What is

a black hole? What is known about black holes? 
A black hole is one of the possible final stagesin the evolution of a star. When fusion reactions

stop in the core of a star that is at least 20 times

more massive than the Sun, the core collapses

forever, compacting matter into an increasingly

smaller volume. The infinitely small, but infi-

nitely dense, object that remains is called a sin-

gularity. The force of gravity is so immense in

the region around the singularity that nothing,
not even light, can escape it. This region is

called a black hole. 
Nothing Can EscapeIn1917, German mathematician

Karl Schwarzschild verified,

mathematically, that black holes

could exist. Schw
arzschild usedsolutions to EinsteinÕs theory ofgeneral relativity to describe the
properties of black holes. He

derived an expression for a

radius, called the Schwarzschild

radius, within which neither

light nor matter escapes the
force of gravity of the singular-

ity. The Schw
arzschild radius isrepresented by the following

equation:Rs2Gc2MIn this equation, Gis NewtonÕs universal gravi-
tational constant, Mis the mass of the blackhole, and 
cis the speed of light. The edge ofthe sphere defined by the Schwarzschild radius

is called the event horizon. At the event hori-

zon, the escape velocity equals the speed of

light. Because nothing travels faster than the

speed of light, objects that cross the event 

horizon can never escape. 
Indirect and Direct EvidenceBlackholes have three  physical properties that can

theoretically be measuredÑmass, angular

momentum, and electric charge. A black holeÕs
mass can be determined by the gravitational

field it generates. Mass is calculated by using 

a modified form of KeplerÕs third law of plane-

tary motion. Studies using NASAÕs 
Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer
have shown that black holes
spin just as stars and planets do. A black hole
spins because it retains the angular momentum
of the star that formed it. Even though a black

holeÕs electric charge has not been measured,

scientists hypothesize that a black hole may

become charged when an excess of one type 
of electric charge falls into it. Super-heated
gases in a black hole emit X rays, which can 

be detected by X-ray telescopes, such as the

space-based Chandra X-ray Observatory.
Although not everything is known about
black holes, there is direct and indirect evi-

dence of their existence. Continued research

and special missions will provide a better

understanding of black holes.
Solve
The escape velocity of an object
leaving the event horizon can be repre-
sented by the following equation:v2GRsMIn this equation, Gis NewtonÕs universal
gravitational constant, 
Mis the mass of theblack hole, and Rsis the radius of the blackhole. Show that the escape velocity equals

the speed of light.Going Further

angular accelerationYou probably have observed a spinning object many times. How

would you measure such an objectÕs rotation? Find a circular object,
such as a CD. Mark one point on the edge of the CD so that you can keep

track of its position. Rotate the CD to the left (counterclockwise), and as

you do so, watch the location of the mark. When the mark returns to its

original position, the CD has made one complete revolution. How can 

you measure a fraction of one revolution? It can be measured in several

different ways. A 
grad is 4100of a revolution, whereas a degree is 
3160of a revolution. In mathematics and physics, yet another form of measure-

ment is used to describe fractions of revolutions. In one revolution, a 

point on the edge travels a distance equal to 2
times the radius of the object. For this reason, the 
radianis defined as 12of a revolution. In
other words, one complete revolution is equal to 2
radians. A radian is
abbreviated Òrad.ÓSection 8.1Describing Rotational Motion

The pie chart shows
the radian measure of the mostcommon angles, measured in the

counterclockwise direction. Eachangle is measured from 0.Angular DisplacementThe Greek letter theta, , is used to represent the angle of revolution.
Figure 8-1shows the angles in radians for several common fractions of a
revolution. Note that counterclockwise rotation is designated as positive,

while clockwise is negative. As an object rotates, the change in the angle is

called angular displacement.As you know, Earth makes one complete revolution, or 2
rad, in 24 h.In 12 h, its rotation is through rad. Through what angle does Earth rotatein 6 h? Because 6 h is one-fourth of a day, Earth rotates through an angle of
2rad during that period. EarthÕs rotation as seen from the north pole is
positive. Is it positive or negative when viewed from the south pole? 
How far does a point on a rotating object move? You already found that
a point on the edge of an object moves 2
times the radius in one revolu-
tion. In general, for rotation through an angle, 
, a point at a distance, 
r,from the center, as shown in 
Figure 8-2,moves a distance given by 
dr.If ris measured in meters, you might think that multiplying it by 
radwould result in 
dbeing measured in mrad. However, this is not the case.
Radians indicate the ratio between 
dand r. Thus, 
dis measured in m.Angular Velocity
How fast does a CD spin? How do you determine its speed of rotation?
Recall from Chapter 2 that velocity is displacement divided by the time taken

to make the displacement. Likewise, the 
angular velocity
of an object isangular displacement divided by the time taken to make the displacement.

Thus, the angular velocity of an object is given by the following equation,

where angular velocity is represented by the Greek letter omega, 
.Angular Velocity of an Object
tThe angular velocity is equal to the angular displacement divided by the time
required to make the rotation.
198Chapter 8Rotational Motion
Figure 8-2
The dashed line
shows the path of the point on the CD as the CD rotates

counterclockwise about its center. 
196-200 CH08-S1-845813  6/3/04  10:52 AM  Page 198Recall that if the velocity changes over a time interval, the average veloc-
ity is not equal to the instantaneous velocity at any given instant. Similarly,
the angular velocity calculated in this way is actually the average angular

velocity over a time interval, 
t. Instantaneous angular velocity is equal to
the slope of a graph of angular position versus time.
Angular velocity is measured in rad/s. For Earth, 
E(2rad)/(24.0 h)(3600 s/h)7.27105rad/s. In the same way that counter-
clockwise rotation produces positive angular displacement, it also results

in positive angular velocity. 
If an objectÕs angular velocity is 
, then the linear velocity of a point a
distance, 
r, from the axis of rotation is given by 
vr. The speed at whichan object on EarthÕs equator moves as a result of EarthÕs rotation is given

by 
vr(6.38106m)(7.27105rad/s)464 m/s. Earth is an
example of a rotating, rigid body. Even though different points on Earth

rotate different distances in each revolution, all points rotate through the

same angle. All parts of a rigid body rotate at the same rate. The Sun, on the

other hand, is not a rigid body. Different parts of the Sun rotate at different

rates. Most objects that we will consider in this chapter are rigid bodies. 
Angular Acceleration
What if angular velocity is changing? For example, if a car were acceler-
ated from 0.0 m/s to 25 m/s in 15 s, then the angular velocity of the wheels

also would change from 0.0 rad/s to 78 rad/s in the same 15 s. The wheels

would undergo 
angular acceleration,which is defined as the change inangular velocity divided by the time required to make the change. Angular

acceleration, , is represented by the following equation. 
Angular acceleration is measured in rad/s2. If the change in angularvelocity is positive, then the angular acceleration also is positive. Angular

acceleration defined in this way is also the average angular acceleration

over the time interval 
t. One way to find the instantaneous angular accel-
eration is to find the slope of a graph of angular velocity as a function of

time. The linear acceleration of a point at a distance, 
r, from the axis of anobject with angular acceleration, , is given by 
ar. Table 8-1
is a sum-mary of linear and angular relationships.

A rotating object can make many revolutions in a
given amount of time. For instance, a spinning wheel can go through 
several complete revolutions in 1 min. Thus, the number of complete 

revolutions made by the object in 1 s is called angular frequency. Angular

frequency isf/2. In the next section, you will explore the factors that
cause the angular frequency to change.
196-200 CH08-S1-845813  6/3/04  10:53 AM  Page 200How do you start the rotation of an object? That is, how do you
change its angular velocity? Suppose you have a soup can that 
you want to spin. If you wrap a string around it and pull hard, you could

make the can spin rapidly. Later in this chapter, you will learn why gravity,

the force of EarthÕs mass on the can, acts on the center of the can. The force

of the string, on the other hand, is exerted at the outer edge of the can, and
at right angles to the line from the center of the can, to the point where the
string leaves the canÕs surface. 
You have learned that a force changes the velocity of a point object. In
the case of a soup can, a force that is exerted in a very specific way changes

the angular velocity of an extended object, which is an object that has a 

definite shape and size. Consider how you open a door: you exert a force.

How can you exert the force to open the door most easily? To get the most

effect from the least force, you exert the force as far from the axis of rota-

tion as possible, as shown in 
Figure 8-3.In this case, the axis of rotation
is an imaginary vertical line through the hinges. The doorknob is near the

outer edge of the door. You exert the force on the doorknob at right angles

to the door, away from the hinges. Thus, the magnitude of the force, the

distance from the axis to the point where the force is exerted, and the direc-
tion of the force determine the change in angular velocity.
Lever arm
For a given applied force, the change in angular velocity
depends on the lever arm,
which is the perpendicular distance from theaxis of rotation to the point where the force is exerted. If the force is perpendicular to the radius of rotation, as it was with the soup can, then

the lever arm is the distance from the axis, 
r.For the door, it is the distance
from the hinges to the point where you exert the force, as illustrated 

in Figure 8-4a,on the next page. If the force is not perpendicular, the 
perpendicular component of the force must be found.The force exerted by the string around
the can is perpendicular to the radius. 

If a force is not exerted perpendicular to
the radius, however, the lever arm is

reduced. To 
find the lever arm, extend
the line of the force until it forms a right
angle with a line from the center of 
rotation. The distance between the inter-

section and the axis is the lever arm.

Thus, using 
trigonometry, the lever 
arm, L,can be calculated by the equation 
Lrsin , as shown in 
Figure 8-4b.
Inthis equation, ris the distance from theaxis of rotation to the point where the
force is exerted, and is the anglebetween the force and the radius from

the axis of rotation to the point where
the force is applied. Objectives

The Moment of Inertia
If you exert a force on a point mass, its acceleration will be inversely 
proportional to its mass. How does an extended object rotate when a
torque is exerted on it? To observe firsthand, recover the pencil, the coins,

and the transparent tape that you used earlier in this chapter. First, tape the

coins at the ends of the pencil.Hold the pencil between your thumb and

forefinger, and wiggle it back and forth. Take note of the forces that your

thumb and forefinger exert. These forces create torques that change the
angular velocity of the pencil and coins. 
Now move the coins so that they are only 1 or 2 cm apart. Wiggle the
pencil as before. Did the amount of torque and force need to be changed?

The torque that was required was much less this time. Thus, the amount of

mass is not the only factor that determines how much torque is needed to

change angular velocity; the location of that mass also is relevant. 
The resistance to rotation is called the moment of inertia,which isrepresented by the symbol 
Iand has units of mass times the square of thedistance. For a point object located at a distance, 
r, from the axis of rota-tion, the moment of inertia is given by the following equation.
Moment of Inertia of a Point Mass
Imr2The moment of inertia of a point mass is equal to the mass of the object
times the square of the objectÕs distance from the axis of rotation.
201-210 CH08-S2-845813  6/3/04  10:59 AM  Page 205206Chapter 8Rotational Motion
As you have seen, the moment of inertia for complex objects,
such as the pencil and coins, depends on how far the coins are
from the axis of rotation. A bicycle wheel, for example, has

almost all of its mass in the rim and tire. Its moment of inertia

is almost exactly equal to mr2, where ris the radius of thewheel. For most objects, however, the mass is distributed 

continuously and so the moment of inertia is less than mr2. For
example, as shown in 
Table 8-2,
for a solid cylinder of radius r,I12mr2, while for a solid sphere, 
I2
5mr2. The moment of inertia also depends on the location of therotational axis, as illustrated in 
Figure 8-8.To observe this first-
hand, hold a book in the upright position, by placing your hands
at the bottom of the book. Feel the torque needed to rock the

book towards you, and then away from you. Now put your

hands in the middle of the book and feel the torque needed to
rock the book toward you and then away from you. Note that

much less torque is needed when your hands are placed in the

middle of the book because the average distance of the bookÕs

mass from the rotational axis is much less in this case.

ABCDNewton’s Second Law for Rotational Motion
Newton's second law for linear motion is expressed as 
aFnet/m. If you
rewrite this equation to represent rotational motion, acceleration isreplaced by angular acceleration, 
, force is replaced by net torque, 
net,and mass is replaced by moment of inertia, 
I. Thus, 
NewtonÕs second law
for rotational motionstates that angular acceleration is directly propor-tional to the net torque and inversely proportional to the moment of 

inertia. This law is expressed by the following equation.
Recall the coins taped on the pencil. To change the direction of rotation
of the pencilÑto give it angular accelerationÑyou had to apply torque to

the pencil. The greater the moment of inertia, the more torque needed to
produce the same angular acceleration.NewtonÕs Second Law for Rotational Motion
nIetThe angular acceleration of an object is equal to the net torque on the object,
divided by the moment of inertia.

involved in an accident? What causes a vehicle to roll over? The
answer lies in the design of the vehicle. In this section, you will learn some

of the factors that cause an object to tip over.
The Center of Mass
How does an object rotate around its center of mass? A wrench may spin
about its handle or end-over-end. Does any single point on the wrench 

follow a straight path? 
Figure 8-11a
shows the path of the wrench. You can
see that there is a single point whose path traces a straight line, as if the

wrench could be replaced by a point particle at that location. The 
center ofmassof an object is the point on the object that moves in the same way that
a point particle would move.
Locating the center of massHow can you locate the center of mass of an
object? First, suspend the object from any point. When the object stops
swinging, the center of mass is along the vertical line drawn from the sus-

pension point as shown in 
Figure 8-11b.
Draw the line. Then, suspend the
object from another point. Again, the center of mass must be below this

point. Draw a second vertical line. The center of mass is at the point where

the two lines cross, as shown in 
Figure 8-11c.
The wrench, racket, and allother freely rotating objects rotate about an axis that goes through their 
center of mass. Where is the center of mass of a person located?

For a person who is standing with
his or her arms hanging straight down, the center of mass is a few 
centimeters below the navel, midway between the front and back of 

the personÕs body. It is slightly higher in young children, because of their

relatively larger heads. Because the human body is flexible, however, its

center of mass is not fixed. If you raise your hands above your head, your

center of mass rises 6 to 10 cm. A ballet dancer, for example, can appear to

be floating on air by changing her center of mass in a leap. By raising her

arms and legs while in the air, as shown in 
Figure 8-12,the dancer moves
her center of mass closer to her head. The path of the center of mass is 
a parabola, so the dancerÕs head stays at almost the same height for a 

surprisingly long time.
Center of Mass and Stability
What factors determine whether a vehicle is stable or prone to roll over
in an accident? To understand the problem, think about tipping over a

box. A tall, narrow box, standing on end, tips more easily than a low, broad

box. Why? To tip a box, as shown in 
Figure 8-13,you must rotate it about
a corner. You pull at the top with a force, 
F, applying a torque, 
F. Theweight of the box, acting on the center of mass, 
Fg, applies an opposingtorque, 
w. When the center of mass is directly above the point of support,
wis zero. The only torque is the one applied by you. As the box rotates
farther, its center of mass is no longer above its base of support, and both

torques act in the same direction. At this point, the box tips over rapidly. 
Path of the dancer,s headPathofthedancer,scenterofmassFFwwFgFgFgFFFFFigure 8-12
The upward motion
of the ballet dancerÕs head is less
than the upward motion of the
center of mass. Thus, the head 

and torso move in a nearly
horizontal path. This creates 
an illusion of floating.Figure 8-13
The bent arrows
show the direction of the torque
produced by the force exerted 

to tip over a box.The Fosbury-Flop
In highjumping, a technique called the
Fosbury-Flop allows a high jumper

to clear the bar when it is placed
at the highest position. This is

possible because the athleteÕs

center of mass passes below 

the bar as he or she somersaults

over the bar, with his or her back

toward it.212Chapter 8Rotational Motion
211-217 CH08-S3-845813  6/3/04  11:06 AM  Page 212StabilityAn object is said to be stable if an external force is required to tipit. The box in Figure 8-13 is stable as long as the direction of the torquedue to its weight, 
wtends to keep it upright. This occurs as long as theboxÕs center of mass lies above its base. To tip the box over, you must rotate

its center of mass around the axis of rotation until it is no longer above the

base of the box. To rotate the box, you must lift its center of mass. The

broader the base, the more stable the object is. For this reason, if you are

standing on a bus that is weaving through traffic and you want to avoid

falling down, you need to stand with your feet spread apart.
Why do vehicles roll over? 
Figure 8-14 shows two vehicles rolling over.
Note that the one with the higher center of mass does not have to be tilted

very far for its center of mass to be outside its baseÑits center of mass does

not have to be raised as much as the other vehicleÕs. The lower the location

of an objectÕs center of mass, the greater its stability.
You are stable when you stand flat on your feet. When you stand on 
tiptoe, however, your center of mass moves forward directly above the balls

of your feet, and you have very little stability. A small person can use

torque, rather than force, to defend himself or herself against a stronger 

person. In judo, aikido, and other martial arts, the fighter uses torque to

rotate the opponent into an unstable position, where the opponentÕs 

center of mass does not lie above his or her feet.
In summary, if the center of mass is outside the base of an object, it is
unstable and will roll over without additional torque. If the center of mass

is above the base of the object, it is stable. If the base of the object is very

narrow and the center of mass is high, then the object is stable, but the

slightest force will cause it to tip over.
Conditions for Equilibrium
If your pen is at rest, what is needed to keep it at rest? You could either
hold it up or place it on a desk or some other surface. An upward force

must be exerted on the pen to balance the downward force of gravity. You

must also hold the pen so that it will not rotate. An object is said to be in

static equilibrium if both its velocity and angular velocity are zero or 

constant. Thus, for an object to be in static equilibrium, it must meet two

conditions. First, it must be in translational equilibrium; that is, the net

force exerted on the object must be zero. Second, it must be in rotational 
equilibrium; that is, the net torque exerted on the object must be zero.
12Figure 8-14
Larger vehicles have a higher center of mass than smaller ones. The
higher the center of mass, the smaller the tilt needed to cause the vehicleÕs center of
mass to move outside its base and cause the vehicle to roll over.

The Coriolis ÒforceÓ
exists only in rotating reference
frames.
abRotating Frames of Reference
When you are on a on a rapidly spinning amusement-park ride, it feels
like a strong force is pushing you to the outside. A pebble on the floor of
the ride would accelerate outward without a horizontal force being exerted

on it in the same direction. The pebble would not move in a straight line.

In other words, NewtonÕs laws would not apply. This is because rotating

frames of reference are accelerated frames. NewtonÕs laws are valid only in

inertial or nonaccelerated frames.
Motion in a rotating reference frame is important to us because Earthrotates. The effects of the rotation of Earth are too small to be noticed in

the classroom or lab, but they are significant influences on the motion of

the atmosphere and therefore, on climate and weather.
Centrifugal “Force”
Suppose you fasten one end of a spring to the center of a rotating plat-
form. An object lies on the platform and is attached to the other end of the
spring. As the platform rotates, an observer on the platform sees the object

stretch the spring. The observer might think that some force toward the

outside of the platform is pulling on the object. This apparent force is
called centrifugal Òforce.Ó
It is not a real force because there is no physi-
cal outward push on the object. Still, this ÒforceÓ seems real, as anyone

who has ever been on an amusement-park ride can attest.
As the platform rotates, an observer on the ground sees things differ-
ently. This observer sees the object moving in a circle. The object acceler-

ates toward the center because of the force of the spring. As you know, the

acceleration is centripetal acceleration and is given by 
acv2/r. It also canbe written in terms of angular velocity, as
ac2/r. Centripetal accelerationis proportional to the distance from the axis of rotation and depends on
the square of the angular velocity. Thus, if you double the rotational 

frequency, the acceleration increases by a factor of 4.
The Coriolis “Force”
A second effect of rotation is shown in 
Figure 8-16.Suppose a personstanding at the center of a rotating disk throws a ball toward the edge of

the disk. Consider the horizontal motion of the ball as seen by two

observers and ignore the vertical motion of the ball as it falls.

An observer onEarth sees the Coriolis ÒforceÓ

to deflect to the right of theintended target. 
Meteorology ConnectionMeteorology ConnectionAn observer standing outside the disk, as shown in 
Figure 8-16a,seesthe ball travel in a straight line at a constant speed toward the edge of the
disk. However, the other observer, who is stationed on the disk and rotat-

ing with it, as shown in 
Figure 8-16b,
sees the ball follow a curved path at
a constant speed. A force seems to be acting to deflect the ball. This appar-
ent force is called the Coriolis Òforce.Ó
Like the centrifugal Òforce,Ó the
Coriolis ÒforceÓ is not a real force. It seems to exist because we observe a

deflection in horizontal motion when we are in a rotating frame of reference.
Coriolis ÒforceÓ due to Earth
Suppose a cannon is fired from a point onthe equator toward a target due north of it. If the projectile were fired directly
northward, it would also have an eastward velocity component because of the

rotation of Earth. This eastward speed is greater at the equator than at any

other latitude. Thus, as the projectile moves northward, it also moves east-

ward faster than points on Earth below it do. The result is that the projectile

lands east of the target as shown in 
Figure 8-17.While an observer in space
would see EarthÕs rotation, an observer on Earth could claim that the projec-

tile missed the target because of the Coriolis ÒforceÓ on the rocket. Note that
for objects moving toward the equator, the direction of the apparent force

is westward. A projectile will land west of the target when fired due south.
The direction of winds around high- and low-pressure areas results from
the Coriolis Òforce.Ó Winds flow from areas of high to low pressure. Because

of the Coriolis ÒforceÓ in the northern hemisphere, winds from the south

go to the east of low-pressure areas.Winds from the north, however, end

up west of low-pressure areas. Therefore, winds rotate counterclockwise

around low-pressure areas in the northern hemisphere. In the southern

hemisphere however, winds rotate clockwise around low-pressure areas.
Most amusement-park rides thrill the riders because they are in acceler-ated reference frames while on the ride. The ÒforcesÓ felt by roller-coaster

riders at the tops and bottoms of hills, and when moving almost vertically

downward, are mostly related to linear acceleration. On Ferris wheels,

rotors, other circular rides, and on the curves of roller coasters, centrifugal

ÒforcesÓ provide most of the excitement.

For maintenance on large buildings, scaffolding can be hung on the outside. In
order for the scaffolding to support workers, it must be in translational and rota-

tional equilibrium. If two or more forces act on the scaffolding, each can produce

a rotation about either end. Scaffolding with uniform mass distribution acts asthough all of the mass is concentrated at its center. In translational equilibrium

the object is not accelerating; thus, the upward and downward forces are equal. 
In order to achieve rotational equilibrium, the sum of all the clockwise
torques must equal the sum of all the counterclockwise torques as measured from
a pivot point. That is, the net torque must be zero. In this lab you will model 

scaffolding hung from two ropes using a meterstick and spring scales, and use

numbers to measure the forces on the scaffolding. QUESTION

Why are sport-utility vehicles more
flippable?Many believe that the large size
of the sport-utility vehicle makes it more sta-
ble and secure. But, a sport-utility vehicle, as

well as other tall vehicles such as vans, is

much more likely to roll over than a car.
The Problem
A sport-utility vehicle has a
high center of mass which makes it more
likely to topple. Another factor that affects

rollover is the static stability factor, which 

is the ratio of the track width to the center 
of mass. Track width is defined as half the

distance between the two front wheels. The

higher the static stability factor, the more

likely a vehicle will stay upright. 
Many sport-utility vehicles have a center of
mass 13 or 15 cm higher than passenger cars.
Their track width, however, is about the same

as that of passenger cars. Suppose the stabil-

ity factor for a sport-utility vehicle is 1.06

and 1.43 for a car. Statistics show that in a

single-vehicle crash, the sport-utility vehicle

has a 37 percent chance of rolling over, while

the car has a 10.6 percent chance of rolling over. 
However, the static stability factor oversimpli-
fies the issue. Weather and driver behavior are

also contributers torollove
r crashes. V
ehicle factors, such as tires, suspension systems, 

inertial properties, and advanced handling 

systems all play a role as well. 
It is true that most rollover crashes occur
when a vehicle swerves off the road and hits a

rut, soft soil, or other surface irregularity. This

usually occurs when a driver is not paying

proper attention or is speeding. Safe drivers

greatly reduce their chances of being involved

in a rollover accident by paying attention and

driving at the correct speed. Still, weather and

driver behavior being equal, the laws of physics

indicate that sport-utility vehicles carry an

increased risk. What Is Being Done?Some models arebeing built with wider track widths or stronger
roofs. Optional side-curtain air bags have 

sensors to keep the bags inflated for up to 6 s,

rather than the usual fraction of a second. This
will cushion passengers if the vehicle should

flip several times. 
A promising new technology called ElectronicStability Control (ESC) can be used to prevent

rollover accidents. An ESC system has elec-

tronic sensors that detect when a vehicle begins
to spin due to ov
ersteering, and also when itbegins to slide in a plowlike manner because

of understeering. In these instances, an ESC

system automatically 
applies the brakes at oneor more wheels, thereby 
reorienting the vehicle
in the right direction. Safe driving is the key to preventing many
automobile accidents. Knowledge of the physics

behind rollover accidents and the factors that

affect rollover accidents may help make you an

informed, safe driver.

¥Angular acceleration is given by the following equation.
¥For a rotating, rigid object, the angular displacement, velocity, and

acceleration can be related to the linear displacement, velocity, and

acceleration for any point on the object. 
drvrarttKey Concepts
¥When torque is exerted on an object, its angular velocity changes.
¥Torque depends on the magnitude of the force, the distance from the axis of

rotation at which it is applied, and the angle between the force and the radius

from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied. ¥The moment of inertia of an object depends on the way the objectÕs mass 

is distributed about the rotational axis. For a point object:
¥NewtonÕs second law for rotational motion states that angular acceleration 

is directly proportional to the net torque and inversely proportional to the

moment of inertia. nIetImr2Frsin Key Concepts
¥The center of mass of an object is the point on the object that moves in the

same way that a point particle would move.
¥An object is stable against rollover if its center of mass is above its base.
¥An object is in equilibrium if there are no net forces exerted on it and if
there are no net torques acting on it.¥Centrifugal ÒforceÓ and the Coriolis ÒforceÓ are two apparent forces that

appear when a rotating object is analyzed from a coordinate system that

rotates with it.221221-227 CH08-SG CA STP-845813  3/12/04  6:25 AM  Page 221Angularvelocity47.Complete the following concept map using the

Why ItÕs Important
Momentum is the key to
success in many sporting

events, including baseball,

football, ice hockey, and

tennis. BaseballEvery baseball
player dreams of hitting ahome run. When a player

hits the ball, at the moment

of collision, the ball and 
the bat are deformed by 
the collision. The resulting

change in momentum
determines the batterÕs

success.
Think About This

baseball bat when a homerun is hit out of the park? 228physicspp.comfotobankyokohama/firstlight.ca228-235 CH09-S1-845813  3/19/04  4:59 PM  Page 228Section 9.1Impulse and Momentum

plastic ball strikes a bocce ball?
QuestionWhat direction will a hollow plastic ball and a bocce ball move after 

a head-on collision?Procedure
1.Roll a bocce ball and a hollow plastic balltoward each other on a smooth surface.
2.Observe the direction each one moves after

the collision.3.Repeat the experiment, this time keeping the
bocce ball stationary, while rolling the hollow

plastic ball toward it.4.Observe the direction each one moves after

the collision.5.Repeat the experiment one more time, but
keep the hollow plastic ball stationary, while

rolling the bocce ball toward it.6.Observe the direction each one moves after

the collision.AnalysisWhat factors affect how fast the balls move after
the collision? What factors determine the

direction each one moves after the collision?
Critical Thinking
What factor(s) would cause
the bocce ball to move backward after collidingwith the hollow plastic ball? It is always 
exciting to watch a baseball player hit a home run. The 
pitcher fires the baseball toward the plate. The batter swings at the base-
ball and the baseball recoils from the impact of the bat at high speed.Rather than concentrating on the force between the baseball and bat and

their resulting accelerations, as in previous chapters, you will approach this

collision in a different way in this chapter. The first step in analyzing this

type of interaction is to describe what happens before, during, and after

the collision between the baseball and bat. You can simplify the collision

between the baseball and the bat by making the assumption that all

motion is in the horizontal direction. Before the collision, the baseball
moves toward the bat. During the collision, the baseball is squashed

against the bat. After the collision, however, the baseball moves at a higher

velocity 
away 
from the bat, and the bat continues in its path, but at aslower velocity.

after the collision, related to the force acting on it?NewtonÕs second law of motion describes how the

velocity of an object is changed by a net force act-

ing on it. The change in velocity of the ball must

have been caused by the force exerted by the bat on

the ball. The force changes over time, as shown in

Figure 9-1.Just after contact is made, the ball is
squeezed, and the force increases. After the force

reaches its maximum, which is more than 10,000

times the weight of the ball, the ball recovers its

shape and snaps away from the bat. The force rap-
idly returns to zero. This whole event takes place within about 3.0 ms.

How can you calculate the change in velocity of the baseball?
ImpulseNewtonÕs second law of motion, 
Fma, can be rewritten by using
the definition of acceleration as the change in velocity divided by the time
needed to make that change. It can be represented by the following equation:
FmamvtMultiplying both sides of the equation by the time interval, 
t, results inthe following equation:
FtmvImpulse,
or Ft, is the product of the average force on an object and the
time interval over which it acts. Impulse is measured in newton-seconds.

For instances in which the force varies with time, the magnitude of an

impulse is found by determining the area under the curve of a force-time

graph, such as the one shown in Figure 9-1. 
The right side of the equation, mv,involves the change in velocity:
vvfvi. Therefore, 
mvmvfmvi. The product of the objectÕs
mass, 
m, and the objectÕs velocity, 
v,is defined as the momentumof theobject. Momentum is measured in kgm/s. An objectÕs momentum, also
known as linear momentum, is represented by the following equation.
Recall the equation 
Ftmvmvfmvi. Because mvfpfand mvipi, this equation can be rewritten as follows: 
Ftmvpfpi. The right side of this equation, pfpi, describes the change in momentumof an object. Thus, the impulse on an object is equal to the change in its

momentum, which is called the impulse-momentum theorem.Theimpulse-momentum theorem is represented by the following equation.
Impulse-Momentum TheoremFtpfpiThe impulse on an object is equal to the objectÕs final momentum minus the
objectÕs initial momentum.MomentumpmvThe momentum of an object is equal to the mass of the object times the

The force acting on
a baseball increases, then rapidly
decreases during a collision, as
shown in this force-time graph.228-235 CH09-S1-845813  6/3/04  12:12 PM  Page 230If the force on an object is constant, the impulse is the product of theforce multiplied by the 
time interval over which it acts. Generally, the force
is not constant, however, and the impulse is found by using an average
force multiplied by the time interval over which it acts, or by finding the

area under a force-time graph. Because velocity is a vector, momentum also is a vector. Similarly,
impulse is a vector because force is a vector. This means that signs will be

important for motion in one dimension.Using the Impulse-Momentum Theorem
What is the change in momentum of a baseball? From the impulse-momentum theorem, you know that the change in momentum is equal to

the impulse acting on it. The impulse on a baseball can be calculated by

using a force-time graph. In Figure 9-1, the area under the curve is approx-

imately 13.1 Ns. The direction of the impulse is in the direction of the
force. Therefore, the change in momentum of the ball also is 13.1 N
s.Because 1 Ns is equal to 1 kgm/s, the momentum gained by the ball is
13.1 kgm/s in the direction of the force acting on it. Assume that a batter hits a fastball. Before the collision of the ball andbat, the ball, with a mass of 0.145 kg, has a velocity of 
38 m/s. Assume
that the positive direction is toward the pitcher. Therefore, the baseballÕs

momentum is pi(0.145 kg)(38 m/s) 5.5 kgm/s. 
What is the momentum of the ball after the collision? Solve the
impulse-momentum theorem for the final momentum: pfpiFt. The ballÕs final momentum is the sum of the initial momentum and the

impulse. Thus, the ballÕs final momentum is calculated as follows.
pfpi13.1 kgm/s 5.5 kgm/s13.1 kgm/s7.6 kgm/sWhat is the baseballÕs final velocity? Because 
pfmvf, solving for vfyields the following:
vfmpf07.1.645kgkgmm/s/s52 m/s A speed of 52 m/s is fast enough to clear most outfield fences if the base-ball is hit in the correct direction.Using the Impulse-Momentum Theorem to Save Lives
A large change in momentum occurs only when there is a large impulse.
A large impulse can result either from a large force acting over a short
period of time or from a smaller force acting over a long period of time. 
What happens to the driver when a crash suddenly stops a car? An
impulse is needed to bring the driverÕs momentum to zero. According to

the impulse-momentum equation, Ftpfpi. The final momentum, pf,is zero. The initial momentum, pi, is the same with or without an air bag.Thus, the impulse, 
Ft, also is the same. An air bag, such as the one shown
in Figure 9-2,reduces the force by increasing the time interval during
which it acts. It also exerts the force over a larger area of the personÕs body,

thereby reducing the likelihood of injuries.

¥Are the units correct?

¥Does the direction make sense?
Force is exerted in the direction 
opposite to the velocity of the car and thus, is negative.
¥Is the magnitude realistic?
People weigh hundreds of newtons, so it 
is reasonable that the force needed to stop a car would be in the thousands 

of newtons. The impulse is the same for all three stops. Thus, as the stopping 

time is shortened by more than a factor of 10, the force is increased by more 

than a factor of 10. 35.7104kgm/s0.22 s5.7104kgm/s3.8 s5.7104kgm/s21 s5.7104kgm/stpfmvf(2200kg)(

Angular MomentumAs you learned in Chapter 8, the angular velocity of a rotating object
changes only if torque is applied to it. This is a statement of NewtonÕs law
for rotational motion, I/t. This equation can be rearranged in thesame way as NewtonÕs second law of motion was, to produce 
tI.The left side of this equation, t, is the angular impulse of the rotatingobject. The right side can be rewritten as fi. The product of arotating objectÕs moment of inertia and angular velocity is called 
angularmomentum,which is represented by the symbol 
L. The angular momen-tum of an object can be represented by the following equation. 
Angular MomentumL = IThe angular momentum of an object is equal to the product of the objectÕs
moment of inertia and the objectÕs angular velocity.
ab228-235 CH09-S1-845813  6/1/04  4:15 AM  Page 233Angular momentum is measured in kgm2/s. Just as the linear momentum
of an object changes when an impulse acts on it, the angular momentumof an object changes when an angular impulse acts on it. Thus, the angu-

lar impulse on the object is equal to the change in the objectÕs angular

momentum, which is called the angular impulse-angular momentumtheorem.The angular impulse-angular momentum theorem is repre-sented by the following equation.
If there are no forces acting on an object, its linear momentum is con-stant. If there are no torques acting on an object, its angular momentum is
also constant. Because an objectÕs mass cannot be changed, if its momentum

is constant, then its velocity is also constant. In the case of angular momen-

tum, however, the objectÕs angular velocity does not remain constant. This is

because the moment of inertia depends on the objectÕs mass and the way it

is distributed about the axis of rotation or revolution. Thus, the angular

velocity of an object can change even if no torques are acting on it. 
Consider, for example, a planet orbiting the Sun. The torque on the planet
is zero because the gravitational force acts directly toward the Sun. Therefore,

the planetÕs angular momentum is constant. When the distance between the

planet and the Sun decreases, however, the planetÕs moment of inertia of 

revolution in orbit about the Sun also decreases. Thus, the planetÕs angular

velocity increases and it moves faster. This is an explanation of KeplerÕs 

second law of planetary motion, based on NewtonÕs laws of motion. 
Angular Impulse-Angular Momentum TheoremtLfLiThe angular impulse on an object is equal to the objectÕs final angular
momentum minus the objectÕs initial angular momentum.234Chapter 9Momentum and Its Conservation
Figure 9-4
The diverÕs center of mass is in front of her feet as she gets ready to 
dive (a).As the diver changes her moment of inertia by moving her arms and legs to
increase her angular momentum, the location of the center of mass changes, but 
the path of the center of mass remains a parabola (b).FgCenter of massFAstronomy ConnectionAstronomy ConnectionabTim Fuller 
228-235 CH09-S1-845813  3/10/04  10:36 PM  Page 234Consider the diver in 
Figure 9-4.How does she start rotating her body?
She uses the diving board to apply an external torque to her body. Then,
she moves her center of mass in front of her feet and uses the board to give

a final upward push to her feet. This torque acts over time, 
t, and thusincreases the angular momentum of the diver. 
Before the diver reaches the water, she can change her angular velocity
by changing her moment of inertia. She may go into a tuck position, grab-

bing her knees with her hands. By moving her mass closer to the axis of

rotation, the diver decreases her moment of inertia and increases her angu-

lar velocity. When she nears the water, she stretches her body straight,

thereby increasing the moment of inertia and reducing the angular veloc-

ity. As a result, she goes straight into the water. 
An ice-skater uses a similar method to spin. To begin rotating on one
foot, the ice-skater applies an external torque to her body by pushing a

portion of the other skate into the ice, as shown in 
Figure 9-5.If shepushes on the ice in one direction, the ice will exert a force on her in the
opposite direction. The force results in a torque if the force is exerted some
distance away from the pivot point, and in a direction that is not toward

it. The greatest torque for a given force will result if the push is perpendi-

cular to the lever arm. 
The ice-skater then can control his angular velocity by changing her
moment of inertia. Both arms and one leg can be extended from the body
to slow the rotation, or pulled in close to the axis of rotation to speed it

up. To stop spinning, another torque must be exerted by using the second

skate to create a way for the ice to exert the needed force.

11.Angular MomentumAn ice-skater spins with his arms outstretched. When he pulls his arms in

and raises them above his head, he spins much

faster than before. Did a torque act on the ice-
skater? If not, how could his angular velocity have
increased? 12.Critical ThinkingAn archer shoots arrows at a
target. Some of the arrows stick in the target, while

others bounce off. Assuming that the masses of 

the arrows and the velocities of the arrows are 

the same, which arrows produce a bigger impulse

on the target?

during a time interval changes the momentum of a baseball. In the 
discussion of NewtonÕs third law of motion, you learned that forces are 

the result of interactions between two objects. The force of a bat on a ball

is accompanied by an equal and opposite force of the ball on the bat. Does

the momentum of the bat, therefore, also change? 
Two-Particle Collisions
The bat, the hand and arm of the batter, and the ground on which the
batter is standing are all objects that interact when a batter hits the ball.
Thus, the bat cannot be considered a single object. In contrast to this com-

plex system, examine for a moment the much simpler system shown in

Figure 9-6,the collision of two balls.
During the collision of the two balls, each one briefly exerts a force on
the other. Despite the differences in sizes and velocities of the balls, the

forces that they exert on each other are equal and opposite, according to

NewtonÕs third law of motion. These forces are represented by the follow-

ing equation: FD on CFC on DHow do the impulses imparted by both balls compare? Because the
time intervals over which the forces are exerted are the same, the impulses

must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. How did the

momenta of the balls change as a result of the collision?According to the impulse-momentum theorem, the change in momen-
tum is equal to the impulse. Compare the changes in the momenta of the

two balls. 
For ball C: 
pCfpCiFD on CtFor ball D: 
pDfpDiFC on DtBecause the time interval over which the forces were exerted is the same,
the impulses are equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction. According

to NewtonÕs third law of motion, 
FC on DFD on C. Thus, 
pCfpCi(pDfpDi), or pCfpDfpCipDi.This equation states that the sum of the momenta of the balls is the same
before and after the collision. That is, the momentum gained by ball D is

equal to the momentum lost by ball C. If the system is defined as the two

balls, the momentum of the system is constant, and therefore, momentum

is conserved for the system.
Momentum in a Closed, Isolated System
Under what conditions is the momentum of the system of two balls
conserved? The first and most obvious condition is that no balls are lost

and no balls are gained. Such a system, which does not gain or lose mass,

is said to be a closed system.
The second condition required to conserve
the momentum of a system is that the forces involved are internal forces;

that is, there are no forces acting on the system by objects outside of it.

237When the net external force on a closed system is zero, the system is
described as an isolated system.
No system on Earth can be said to be
absolutely isolated, however, because there will always be some interac-

tions between a system and its surroundings. Often, these interactions are

small enough to be ignored when solving physics problems. 
Systems can contain any number of objects, and the objects can stick
together or come apart in a collision. Under these conditions, the 
law of
conservation of momentum
states that the momentum of any closed,
isolated system does not change. This law will enable you to make a 

connection between conditions, before and after an interaction, without

knowing any of the details of the interaction.

Recoil
It is very important to define a system carefully. The momentum of a
baseball changes when the external force of a bat is exerted on it. The base-ball, therefore, is not an isolated system. On the other hand, the total

momentum of two colliding balls within an isolated system does not

change because all forces are between the objects within the system.

moving, making this situation similar to that of an explosion. Because the
push was an internal force, you can use the law of conservation of momen-

tum to find the skatersÕ relative velocities. The total momentum of the system

was zero before the push. Therefore, it must be zero after the push.

an example of recoil. Are the skatersÕ velocities equal and opposite? The

last equation shown above, for the velocity of skater C, can be rewritten 

as follows:
vCfmmCDvDfThe velocities depend on the skatersÕ relative masses. If skater C has 
a mass of 68.0 kg and skater DÕs mass is 45.4 kg, then the ratio of their

velocities will be 68.0:45.4, or 1.50. The less massive skater moves at the

greater velocity. Without more information about how hard skater C

pushed skater D, however, you cannot find the velocity of each skater. 
Propulsion in Space
How does a rocket in space change its velocity? The rocket carries both
fuel and oxidizer. When the fuel and oxidizer combine in the rocket motor,

the resulting hot gases leave the exhaust nozzle at high speed. If the rocket

and chemicals are the system, then the system is a closed system. The forces

that expel the gases are internal forces, so the system is also an isolated sys-

tem. Thus, objects in space can accelerate by using the law of conservation

of momentum and NewtonÕs third law of motion. 
A NASA space probe, called 
Deep Space 1,performed a flyby of an aster-
oid a few years ago. The most unusual of the 11 new technologies on board

was an ion engine that exerts as much force as a sheet of paper resting on

a personÕs hand. The ion engine shown in 
Figure 9-9,operates differentlyfrom a traditional rocket engine. In a traditional rocket engine, the prod-

ucts of the chemical reaction taking place in the combustion chamber are
released at high speed from the rear. In the ion engine, however, xenon

atoms are expelled at a speed of 30 km/s, producing a force of only 0.092 N.

How can such a small force create a significant change in the momentum

of the probe? Instead of operating for only a few minutes, as the traditional

chemical rockets do, the ion engine can run continuously for days, w
eeks,
or months. Therefore, the impulse delivered by the engine is large enough

to increase the momentum of the 490-kg spacecraft until it reaches the

speed needed to complete its mission.Section 9.2Conservation of Momentum

The xenon atoms 
in the ion engine are ionized bybombarding them with electrons.

xenon ions are accelerated to high speeds. Rebound

Up until now, you have looked at momentum in only one dimension.
The law of conservation of momentum holds for all closed systems with
no external forces. It is valid regardless of the directions of the particles

before or after they interact. But what happens in two or three dimensions?

Figure 9-10
shows the result of billiard ball C striking stationary billiard
ball D. Consider the two billiard balls to be the system. The original

momentum of the moving ball is 
pCiand the momentum of the stationaryball is zero. Therefore, the momentum of the system before the collision is

equal to pCi. After the collision, both billiard balls are moving and have momenta. As
long as the friction with the tabletop can be ignored, the system is closed

and isolated. Thus, the law of conservation of momentum can be used.

The initial momentum equals the vector sum of the final momenta, so 

pCipCfpDf. The equality of the momenta before and after the collision also meansthat the sum of the components of the vectors before and after the colli-

sion must be equal. Suppose the x-axis is defined to be in the direction ofthe initial momentum, then the y-component of the initial momentum isequal to zero. Therefore, the sum of the final 
y-components also must be zero: pCf, ypDf, y0The y-components are equal in magnitude but are in the opposite direc-tion and, thus, have opposite signs. The sum of the horizontal components

also is equal:pCipCf, xpDf, xSection 9.2Conservation of Momentum

Conservation of Angular Momentum
Like linear momentum, angular momentum can be conserved. The 
law
of conservation of angular momentum
states that if no net externaltorque acts on an object, then its angular momentum does not change.
This is represented by the following equation.
For example, Earth spins on its axis with no external torques. Its angu-
lar momentum is constant. Thus, EarthÕs angular momentum is conserved.

As a result, the length of a day does not change. A spinning ice-skater also

demonstrates conservation of angular momentum. 
Figure 9-11a
shows 
an ice-skater spinning with his arms extended. When he pulls in his arms,

as shown in 
Figure 9-11b,
he begins spinning faster. Without an external
torque, his angular momentum does not change; that is, 
LIis constant. Thus, the ice-skaterÕs increased angular velocity must be accom-

panied by a decreased moment of inertia. By pulling his arms close to his

body, the ice-skater brings more mass closer to the axis of rotation, thereby

decreasing the radius of rotation and decreasing his moment of inertia.
You can calculate changes in angular velocity using the law of conservation

of angular momentum. LiLfthus,

236-245 CH09-S2-845813  6/1/04  1:42 AM  Page 243Notice that because f, , and Iappear as ratios in theseequations, any units may be used, as long as the same
unit is used for both values of the quantity.
If a torque-free object starts with no angular momen-tum, it must continue to have no angular momentum.

Thus, if part of an object rotates in one direction,

another part must rotate in the opposite direction. For

example, if you switch on a loosely held electric drill,

the drill body will rotate in the direction opposite to
the rotation of the motor and bit. Consider a ball thrown at a weather vane. The ball,
moving in a straight line, can start the vane rotating.

Consider the ball and vane to be a system. With no

external torques, angular momentum is conserved. The

vane spins faster if the ball has a large mass, 
m,a largevelocity, 
v,and hits at right angles as far as possiblefrom the pivot of the vane. The angular momentum of a moving object,

such as the ball, is given by 
Lmvr, where ris the perpendicular distancefrom the axis of rotation. Tops and Gyroscopes
Because of the conservation of angular momentum, the direction of
rotation of a spinning object can be changed only by applying a torque. If

you played with a top as a child, you may have spun it by pulling the string

wrapped around its axle. When a top is vertical, there is no torque on it,

and the direction of its rotation does not change. If the top is tipped, as

shown in 
Figure 9-12,a torque tries to rotate it downward. Rather than
tipping over, however, the upper end of the top revolves, or precesses

slowly about the vertical axis. Because Earth is not a perfect sphere, the Sun

exerts a torque on it, causing it to precess. It takes about 26,000 years for

EarthÕs rotational axis to go through one cycle of precession.

direction of its large angular momentum can be changed
only by applying an appropriate torque. Without such a

torque, the direction of the axis of rotation does not

change. Gyroscopes are used in airplanes, submarines,

and spacecraft to keep an unchanging reference direction.
Giant gyroscopes are used in cruise ships to reduce their
motion in rough water. Gyroscopic compasses, unlike

magnetic compasses, maintain direction even when they

A football quarterback uses the gyroscope effect tomake an accurate forward pass. As he throws, he spins, or

spirals the ball. If the quarterback throws the ball in the

direction of its spin axis of rotation, the ball keeps its
pointed end forward, thereby reducing air resistance. Thus, the ball can be

thrown far and accurately. If its spin 
direction is slightly off, the ball wob-
bles. If the ball is not spun, it tumbles end over end. 
The flight of a plastic disk also is stabilized by spin. A well-spun plastic
disk can fly many meters through the air without wobbling. You are able

to perform tricks with a yo-yo because its fast rotational speed keeps it

rotating in one plane.

Solar SailingSolar SailingNearly 400 years ago,
Johannes Kepler
observed that comet tails appeared to be blown
by a solar breeze. He suggested that ships

would be able to travel in space with sails

designed to catch this breeze. Thus, the idea for

solar sails was born. 
How Does a Solar Sail Work?
A solarsail is a spacecraft without an engine. A solar

sail works like a giant fabric mirror that is 

free to move. Solar sails

usually are made of 
5-micron-thick alu-
minized polyester film

or polyimide film with
a 100-nm-thick alu-

minum layer deposited

on one side to form 
the reflective surface. 
Reflected sunlight,
rather than rocket fuel,
provides the force.

Sunlight is made up 
of individual particles
called photons. Photons

have momentum, and

when a photon bounces
off a solar sail, it trans-
fers its momentum to
the sail, which propels
the spacecraft along.The force of impacting photons is small incomparison to the force rocket fuel can supply.

So, small sails experience only a small amount
of force from sunlight, while larger sails experi-
ence a greater force. Thus, solar sails may be a

kilometer or so across. 
What speeds can a solar sail achieve? This
depends on the momentum transferred to the
sail by photons, as well as the sailÕs mass. To

travel quickly through the solar system, a sail

and the spacecraft should be lightweight. 
Photons supplied by the Sun are constant.
They impact the sail every second of every hour

of every day during a space flight. The SunÕs

continuous supply of photons over time allows

the sail to build up huge velocities and enables

the spacecraft to travel great distances within a

convenient time frame. Rockets require enor-

mous amounts of fuel to move large masses,
but solar sails only require photons from the
Sun. Thus, solar sails may be a superior way 

to move large masses over great distances in

outer space.
Future Journeys
The Cosmos 1,the firstsolar-sail prototype, is scheduled for a launch

in the very near future. The 
Cosmos-1mission is an international, privately funded venture.

The spacecraft looks like a flower with eight
huge, solar-sail petals.

Being the first solar sail,
goals are modest. The
mission will be consid-
ered successful if the
Cosmos 1operates for justa few days, accelerating

under sunlight pressure. 
Solar sails are impor-tant, not only for travel,

but also for creating new
types of space and Earth
weather monitoring 

stations. These stations

would be able to provide

greater coverage of Earth

and more advanced

warning of solar storms

that cause problems to
communication and elec-
tric power grids. It is
hoped that in the next few decades, solar sails

will be used as interplanetary shuttles because
of their ability to travel great distances in 

convenient time frames
.Vast distances could
someday be traversed by
 vehicles that do not
consume any fuel. 
1.Research 
how solar sails can help pro-
vide advanced warning of solar storms.2.Critical Thinking
A certain solar-sail
model is predicted to take more time 
to reach Mars than a rocket-propelled
spacecraft would, but less time to 

go to Pluto than a rocket-propelled
spacecraft would. Explain why this is so. Going Further

¥When doing a momentum problem, first examine the system before and
after the event. 
¥The momentum of an object is the product of its mass and velocity and 

is a vector quantity. 
¥The impulse on an object is the average net force exerted on the object

multiplied by the time interval over which the force acts. 
¥The impulse on an object is equal to the change in momentum of the object. ¥The angular momentum of a rotating object is the product of its moment of
inertia and its angular velocity. 
¥The angular impulse-angular momentum theorem states that the angular
impulse on an object is equal to the change in the objectÕs angular

momentum.tLfLiLIFtpfpiImpluseFtpmvKey Concepts
¥According to NewtonÕs third law of motion and the law of conservation of

momentum, the forces exerted by colliding objects on each other are equal

in magnitude and opposite in direction.¥Momentum is conserved in a closed, isolated system.
¥The law of conservation of momentum can be used to explain the

propulsion of rockets.
¥Vector analysis is used to solve momentum-conservation problems in 

two dimensions.
¥The law of conservation of angular momentum states that if there are no

external torques acting on a system, then the angular momentum is

conserved.
¥Because angular momentum is conserved, the direction of rotation of a

spinning object can be changed only by applying a torque.

wattIn Chapter 9, you learned about the conservation of momentum. You

learned that you could examine the state of a system before and after
an impulse acted on it without knowing the details about the impulse. The

law of conservation of momentum was especially useful when considering

collisions, during which forces sometimes changed dramatically. Recall 

the discussion in Chapter 9 of the two skaters who push each other away.

While momentum is conserved in this situation, the skaters continue to

move after pushing each other away; whereas before the collision, they

were at rest. When two cars crash into each other, momentum is conserved.

Unlike the skaters, however, the cars, which were moving prior to the 

collision, became stationary after the crash. The collision probably
resulted in a lot of twisted metal and broken glass. In these types of situa-

tions, some other quantity must have been changed as a result of the force

acting on each system.
Section 10.1Energy and Work
257256-265 CH10-S1-845813  6/10/04  4:11 PM  Page 257Work and Energy
Recall that change in momentum is the result of an impulse, which is the
product of the av
erage force exerted on an object and the time of the inter-action. Consider a force exerted on an object while the object moves a 
certain distance. Because there is a net force, the object will be accelerated,

aF/m, and its velocity will increase. Examine Table 3-3 in Chapter 3, on
page 68, which lists equations 
describing the relationships among position,velocity, and 
time for motion under constant acceleration. Consider theequation involving acceleration, velocity, and distance: 2
advf2vi2. Ifyou use NewtonÕs second law to replace 
awith F/mand multiply bothsides by 
m/2, you obtain 
Fd12mvf21
2mvi2. Work
The left side of the equation describes something that was done to
the system by the external world (the environment). A force, 
F, was exerted
on an object while the object moved a distance, 
d, as shown in 
Figure 10-1
.If Fis a constant force, exerted in the direction in which the object is mov-
ing, then work,
W, is the product of the force and the objectÕs displacement.
You probably have used the word 
workin many other w
ays. For 
exam-ple, a computer might work well, learning physics can be hard work, and
you might work at an after-school job. To physicists, however, work has a

very precise meaning. 
Recall that 
Fd12mvf21
2mvi2. Rewriting the equation 
WFdresults in W1
2mvf21
2mvi2. The right side of the equation involves the objectÕs 
mass and its velocities after and before the force was exerted. The quantity
1
2mvi2describes a property of the system. 
Kinetic energyWhat property of a system does 
12mvi2describe? A massive, fast-moving vehicle can do damage to objects around it, and a
baseball hit at high speed can rise high into the air. That is, an object with

this property can produce a change in itself or the world around it. This

property, the ability of an object to produce a change in itself or the world

around it, is called energy.
The fast-moving vehicle and the baseball 
possess energy that is associated with their motion. This energy resulting
from motion is called kinetic energyand is represented by the symbol 
KE. Substituting KEinto the equation W12mvf21
2mvi2results in WKEfKEi. The right side is the difference, or change, in kinetic energy. The
work-energy theorem
states that when work is done on an object, the result
is a change in kinetic energy. The work-energy theorem can be represented
by the following equation.
Kinetic EnergyKE12mv2The kinetic energy of an object is equal to

259The relationship between work done and the change in energy that
results was established by nineteenth-century physicist James Prescott
Joule. To honor his work, a unit of energy is called a 
joule(J). For example,
if a 2-kg object moves at 1 m/s, it has a kinetic energy of 1 kg
m2/s2, or 1 J. Recall that a system is the object of interest and the external world is
everything else. For example, one system might be a box in a warehouse

and the external world might consist of yourself, EarthÕs mass, and any-

thing else external to the box. Through the process of doing work, energy

can move between the external world and the system. 
Notice that the direction of energy transfer can go both ways. If the
external world does work on a system, then 
Wis positive and the energy
of the system increases. If, however, a system does work on the external

world, then 
Wis negative and the energy of the system decreases. In sum-
mary, work is the transfer of energy by mechanical means. 
Calculating Work
The first equation used to calculate work is 
WFd. This equation, how-
ever, holds only for constant forces exerted in the direction of motion.

What happens if the force is exerted perpendicular to the direction of
motion? An everyday example of this is the motion of a planet around the

Sun, as shown in 
Figure 10-2
. If the orbit is circular, then the force is
always perpendicular to the direction of motion. Recall from Chapter 6

that a perpendicular force does not change the speed of an object, only its
direction. Consequently, the speed of the planet doesnÕt change. Therefore,

its kinetic energy also is constant. Using the equation WKE, you can
see that when KEis constant, KE0 and thus, 
W0. This means thatif Fand dare at right angles, then 
W0. Because the work done on an object equals the change in energy, work
also is measured in joules. One joule of work is done when a force of 1 N

acts on an object over a displacement of 1 m. An apple weighs about 1 N.

Thus, when you lift an apple a distance of 1 m, you do 1 J of work on it. 
Constant force exerted at an angle
YouÕve learned that a force exerted in
the direction of motion does an amount of work given by 
WFd. A forceexerted perpendicular to the motion does no work. What work does a 
force exerted at an angle do? For example, what work does the person

pushing the car in Figure 10-3a
do? You know that any force can be
replaced by its components. If the coordinate system shown in 
Figure 10-3b
is used, the 125-N force, 
F,exerted in the direction of the personÕs arm, has
two components. The magnitude of the horizontal component, 
Fx, is relatedto the magnitude of the force, 
F, by a cosine function: cos 25.0
°Fx/F. Bysolving for Fx, you obtain 
FxFcos25.0
°(125 N)(cos 25.0°)113 N.
Using the same method, the vertical component 
FyFsin 25.0°(125 N
)(sin 25.0°) 52.8 N, where the negative sign shows that the
force is downward. Because the displacement is in the 
xdirection, only the x-component does work. The 
y-component does no work.

If a force is appliedto a car at an angle, the net force

Work 
When solving work-related problems, use the following
strategies.
1.Sketch the system and show the force that is doing the work. 2.Draw the force and displacement vectors of 
the system.3.Find the angle, , between each force anddisplacement. 4.Calculate the work done by each force using 
WFdcos . 5.Calculate the net work done. Check the sign of the
work using the direction of energy transfer. If the

energy of the system has increased, the work done 
by that force is positive. If the energy has decreased,
then the work done by that force is negative.Work Diagram
FAddddFgFNFNFANAFggThe work you do when you exert a force on an object, at an angle to 
the direction of motion, is equal to the component of the force in thedirection of the displacement, multiplied by the distance moved. The mag-

nitude of the component force acting in the direction of displacement is
found by multiplying the magnitude of force, 
F, by the cosine of the angle
between 
Fand the direction of the displacement: FxFcos. Thus, the
work done is represented by the following equation.
Other agents exert forces on the pushed car as well. Which of these
agents do work? EarthÕs gravity acts downward, the ground exerts a normal

force upward, and friction exerts a horizontal force opposite the direction 

of motion. The upward and downward forces are perpendicular to the

direction of motion and do no work. For these forces, 
90°, whichmakes cos 0, and thus, 
W0. The work done by friction acts in the direction opposite that of
motionÑat an angle of 180°. Because cos 180°1, the work done by
friction is negative. Negative work done by a force exerted by something in

the external world reduces the kinetic energy of the system. If the person

in Figure 10-3a were to stop pushing, the car would quickly stop movingÑ

its energy of motion would be reduced. Positive work done by a force

increases the energy, while negative work decreases it. Use the problem-

solving strategies below when you solve problems related to work.

256-265 CH10-S1-845813  3/21/04  10:27 PM  Page 262Finding work done when forces change
A graph of force versus dis-
placement lets you determine the work done by a force. This graphical
method can be used to solve problems in which the force is changing.

Figure 10-5a
shows the work done by a constant force of 20.0 N that is
exerted to lift an object a distance of 1.50 m. The work done by this 

constant force is represented by 
WFd(20.0 N)(1.50 m)
30.0 J. The
shaded area under the graph is equal to (20.0 N)(1.50 m), or 30.0 J. The

area under a force-displacement graph is equal to the work done by that

force, even if the force changes. 
Figure 10-5b
shows the force exerted by a
spring, which varies linearly from 0.0 to 20.0 N as it is compressed 1.50 m.

The work done by the force that compressed the spring is the area 

under the graph, which is the area of a triangle, 
12(base)(altitude), or W12(20.0 N)(1.50 m)
15.0 J.Work done by many forces
NewtonÕs second law of motion relates the
net force on an object to its acceleration. In the same way, the work-energy
theorem relates the net work done on a system to its energy change. If 

several forces are exerted on a system, calculate the work done by each

force, and then add the results.
Power
Until now, none of the discussions of work has mentioned the time it
takes to move an object. The work done by a person lifting a box of books

is the same whether the box is lifted onto a shelf in 2 s or each book is
lifted separately so that it takes 20 min to put them all on the shelf.

Although the work done is the same, the rate at which it is done is differ-

ent. Power
is the work done, divided by the time taken to do the work. In
other words, power is the rate at which the external force changes the

energy of the system. It is represented by the following equation.
Consider the three students in Figure 10-6.
Thegirl hurrying up the stairs is more powerful than

the boy who is walking up the stairs. Even though

the same work is accomplished by both, the girl

accomplishes it in less time and thus develops

more power. In the case of the two students walk-

ing up the stairs, both accomplish work in the same

amount of time. 
Power is measured in watts (W). One 
watt
is 1 J of energy transferred in 1 s. A watt is a relatively

small unit of power. For example, a glass of water

weighs about 2 N. If you lift it 0.5 m to your

mouth, you do 1 J of work. If you lift the glass in 1

s, you are doing work at the rate of 1 W. Because a

watt is such a small unit, power often is measured

in kilowatts (kW). One kilowatt is equal to 1000 W. 
Power
PWtPower is equal to the work done, divided by the time taken to do the work.

When riding a
multispeed bicycle, if the muscles
in your body exert a force of 400

N and the speed is 2.6 m/s, thepower output is over 1000 W.
Tour de France
A bicyclist in
the Tour de France rides at about
8.94 m/s for more than 6 h a day.

The power output of the racer is

about 1 kW. One-fourth of that

power goes into moving the bike

against the resistance of the air,

gears, and tires. Three-fourths of

the power is used to cool the

racerÕs body.
You may have noticed in Example Problem 3 that when the force and
displacement are in the same direction, PFd/t. However, because the
ratio d/tis the speed, power also can be calculated using 
PFv. When you are riding a multispeed bicycle, how do you choose the cor-
rect gear? You want to get your body to deliver the largest amount of

power. By considering the equation 
PFvyou can see that either zero
force or zero speed results in no power delivered. The muscles cannot exert

extremely large forces, nor can they move very fast. Thus, some combina-

tion of moderate force and moderate speed will produce the largest
amount of power. 
Figure 10-8
shows that in this particular situation, the
maximum power output is over 1000 W when the force is about 400 N and

speed is about 2.6 m/s. All enginesÑnot just humansÑhave these limita-

tions. Simple machines often are designed to match the force and speed

that the engine can deliver to the needs of the job. You will learn more

about simple machines in the next section.256-265 CH10-S1-845813  3/21/04  10:29 PM  Page 265266Chapter 10Energy, Work, and Simple Machines

compound machineEveryone uses machines every day. Some are simple tools, such as bottle

openers and screwdrivers, while others are complex, such as bicycles
and automobiles. Machines, whether powered by engines or people, make

tasks easier. A 
machineeases the load by changing either the magnitude
or the direction of a force to match the force to the capability of the
machine or the person. Benefits of Machines
Consider the bottle opener in Figure 10-9.
When you use the opener,
you lift the handle, thereby doing work on the opener. The opener lifts the

cap, doing work on it. The work that you do is called the input work, 
Wi.The work that the machine does is called the output work, 
Wo. Recall that work is the transfer of energy by mechanical means. You put
work into a machine, such as the bottle opener. That is, you transfer energy

to the opener. The opener, in turn, does work on the cap, thereby transfer-

ring energy to it. The opener is not a source of energy, and therefore, the

cap cannot receive more energy than the amount of energy that you put

into the opener. Thus, the output work can never be greater than the input

work. The machine simply aids in the transfer of energy from you to the

bottle cap. Mechanical advantage
The force exerted by a person on a machine is
called the effort force,
Fe. The force exerted by the machine is called the
resistance force,
Fr. As shown in Figure 10-9a, 
Feis the upward force
exerted by the person using the bottle opener and 
Fris the upward force
exerted by the bottle opener. The ratio of resistance force to effort force,
Fr/Fe, is called the mechanical advantage,
MA, of the machine. 
Mechanical Advantage
MAFFerThe mechanical advantage of a machine is equal to the resistance force
divided by the effort force.
FrFededrabFigure 10-9
A bottle opener isan example of a simple machine.It makes opening a bottle easier,

but it does not lessen the work

required to do so.Hutchings Photography 266-273 CH10-S2-845813  3/21/04  10:33 PM  Page 266Section 10.2Machines
267In a fixed pulley, such as the one shown in 
Figure 10-10a,
the forces, 
FeandFr, are equal, and consequently MAis 1. What is the advantage of this
machine? The fixed pulley is useful, not because the effort force is lessened,but because the direction of the effort force is changed. Many machines, such
as the bottle opener shown 
in Figure 10-9 and the pulley system shown in
Figure 10-10b,
have a mechanical advantage greater than 1. When the
mechanical advantage is greater than 1, the machine increases the force

applied by a person. 
You can write the mechanical advantage of a machine in another way
using the definition of work. The input work is the product of the effort

force that a person exerts, 
Fe, and the distance his or her hand moved, 
de.In the same way, the output work is the product of the resistance force, 
Fr,and the displacement of the load, dr. A machine can increase force, but it
cannot increase energy. An ideal machine transfers all the energy, so the

output work equals the input work: 
WoWi or FrdrFede. This equation can be rewritten Fr/Fede/dr. Recall that mechanical
advantage is given by 
MAFr/Fe. Therefore, for an ideal machine, 
idealmechanical advantage,
IMA, is equal to the displacement of the effortforce, divided by the displacement of the load. The ideal mechanical

advantage can be represented by the following equation. 
Note that you measure the distances moved to calculate the ideal mechan-
ical advantage, but you measure the forces exerted to find the actual

mechanical advantage. 
Ideal Mechanical Advantage
IMAdderThe ideal mechanical advantage of an ideal machine is equal to the
displacement of the effort force, divided by the displacement of the load.

An electric pump pulls water at a rate of 0.25 m3/sfrom a well that is 25 m deep. The water leaves the
pump at a speed of 8.5 m/s.1.What power is needed to lift the water to the surface? 
2.What power is needed to increase the pumpÕs kinetic
energy? 3.If the pumpÕs efficiency is 80 percent, how much 

power must be delivered to the pump? 25 m8.5 m/sEfficiencyIn a real machine, not all of the input work is available as out-
put work. Energy removed from the system means that there is less output
work from the machine. Consequently, the machine is less efficient at

accomplishing the task. The efficiencyof a machine, 
e, is defined as theratio of output work to input work. 
An ideal machine has equal output and input work, 
Wo/Wi1, and itsefficiency is 100 percent. All real machines have efficiencies of less than
100 percent.
Efficiency can be expressed in terms of the mechanical advantage 
and ideal mechanical advantage. Efficiency, 
eWo/Wi, can be rewritten as follows:
WWoiFFerddreBecause MAFr/Feand IMAde/dr, the following expression can be 
written for efficiency.
A machineÕs design determines its ideal mechanical advantage. An effi-
cient machine has an MAalmost equal to its IMA. A less-efficient machinehas a small MArelative to its 
IMA. To obtain the same resistance force, a
greater force must be exerted in a machine of lower efficiency than in a
machine of higher efficiency.

Most machines, no matter how complex, are combinations of one or

plane, wedge, and screw. These machines are shown in 
Figure 10-11.
The IMAof all the machines shown in Figure 10-11 is the ratio of 
distances moved. For machines, such as the lever and the wheel and axle,

this ratio can be replaced by the ratio of the distance between the place

where the force is applied and the pivot point. A common version of the

wheel and axle is a steering wheel, such as the one shown in 
Figure 10-12.
The IMAis the ratio of the radii of the wheel and axle. 
A machine consisting of two or more simple machines linked in such a

way that the resistance force of one machine becomes the effort force of

the second is called a compound machine.

A series of simple
machines combine to transmit 
the force that the rider exerts 
on the pedal to the road.In a bicycle, the pedal and front gear act like a wheel and axle. The effort
force is the force that the rider exerts on the pedal, Frider on pedal. The resist-ance is the force that the front gear exerts on the chain, Fgear on chain, as shown in 
Figure 10-13.
The chain exerts an effort force on the rear gear,
Fchain on gear, equal to the force exerted on the 
chain. This gear and the rearwheel act like another wheel and axle. 
The resistance force is the force thatthe wheel exerts on the road, Fwheel on road. According to NewtonÕs third law,
the ground exerts an equal forward force on the wheel, which accelerates

the bicycle forward.
The MAof a compound machine is the product of the MAs of the simplemachines from which it is made. For example, in the case of the bicycle

Multi-gear bicycle
On a multi-gear bicycle, the rider can change the 
MAof the machine by choosing the size of one or both gears. When accelerat-
ing or climbing a hill, the rider increases the ideal mechanical advantage

to increase the force that the wheel exerts on the road. To increase the 
IMA,the rider needs to make the rear gear radius large compared to the front
gear radius (refer to the IMAequation on page 270). For the same force
exerted by the rider, a larger force is exerted by the wheel on the road.

However, the rider must rotate the pedals through more turns for each 

revolution of the wheel.
On the other hand, less force is needed to ride the bicycle at high speed
on a level road. The rider needs to choose a gear that has a small rear gear

and a large front gear that will result in a smaller IMA. Thus, for the same
force exerted by the rider, a smaller force is exerted by the wheel on the

road. However, in return, the rider does not have to move the pedals as far

for each revolution of the wheel.
An automobile transmission works in the same way. To accelerate a car
from rest, large forces are needed and the transmission increases the IMA.At high speeds, however, the transmission reduces the 
IMAbecause smallerforces are needed. Even though the speedometer shows a high speed, the

tachometer indicates the engineÕs low angular speed.
266-273 CH10-S2-845813  3/21/04  10:38 PM  Page 272physicspp.com/self_check_quizThe Human Walking Machine
Movement of the human body is explained by the same principles of
force and work that describe all motion. Simple machines, in the form of
levers, give humans the ability to walk and run. The lever systems of the

human body are complex. However each system has the following four

basic parts. 
1.a rigid bar (bone) 2.a source of force (muscle contraction) 3.a fulcrum or pivot (movable joints between bones)
4.a resistance (the weight of the body or an object being lifted or

moved) 
Figure 10-15
shows the parts of the lever system in a human leg. Lever
systems of the body are not very efficient, and mechanical advantages are

low. This is why walking and jogging require energy (burn calories) and

help people lose weight. 
When a person walks, the hip acts as a fulcrum and moves through the
arc of a circle, centered on the foot. The center of mass of the body moves

as a resistance around the fulcrum in the same arc. The length of the radius
of the circle is the length of the lever formed by the bones of the leg.

Athletes in walking races increase their velocity by swinging their hips

upward to increase this radius. A tall personÕs body has lever systems with

less mechanical advantage than a short personÕs does. Although tall people

usually can walk faster than short people can, a tall person must apply 

a greater force to move the longer lever formed by the leg bones. How

would a tall person do in a walking race? What are the factors that affect a

tall personÕs performance? Walking races are usually 20 or 50 km long.

Because of the inefficiency of their lever systems and the length of a walk-

ing race, very tall people rarely have the stamina to win.

Bicycle Gear Shifters
In a multispeed bicycle with two or three front gears and from five to eight
rear gears, front and rear derailleurs (shifters) are employed to position the

chain. Changing the combination of front and rear gears varies the 
IMAofthe system. A larger 
IMAreduces effort in climbing hills. A lower 
IMAallows for greater speed on level ground, but more effort is required. 
IMAnumber of teeth on rear gearnumber of teeth on front gearFront
derailleurRear

cableUpper 
gearLower 
gear4The rear derailleur, 
responding to movements 
of the right-hand shift  
lever, positions the chain  

on the rear gears. The  
rear derailleur assembly 
includes two small gears. 
The lower gear, tensioned 

by a spring, keeps the 
chain tight as it moves  
from larger to smaller 
gears. The upper gear 
moves in or out to position 
the chain on the gears  
next to it.3The front derailleur 
lifts the chain off of 
the gear teeth and 
moves it to another 
gear near it in 
response to the 
tightening or 
loosening of the 
cable that connects 
it to the left-hand 
shift lever.
1The left-hand shift lever 
adjusts the position of the 
front derailleur by means 
of a connecting cable.2The right-hand shift 
lever adjusts the 
position of the rear 
derailleur by means  
of a wire cable routed 
along the frame from 
the shift lever to the 
derailleur.

Key Concepts
¥Work is the transfer of energy by mechanical means.
¥A moving object has kinetic energy. 
¥The work done on a system is equal to the change in energy of the system. 
¥Work is the product of the force exerted on an object and the distance the
object moves in the direction of the force. 
¥The work done can be determined by calculating the area under a force-

displacement graph. ¥Power is the rate of doing work, that is the rate at which energy is transferred. 
PWtWFdcos WKEKE12mv2WFdKey Concepts
¥Machines, whether powered by engines or humans, do not change the
amount of work done, but they do make the task easier. 
¥A machine eases the load, either by changing the magnitude or the direction

of the force exerted to do work. 
¥The mechanical advantage, 
MA, is the ratio of resistance force to effort force. 
¥The ideal mechanical advantage, 
IMA, is the ratio of the distances moved. 
¥The efficiency of a machine is the ratio of output work to input work. 
¥In all real machines, 
MAis less than IMA.¥The efficiency of a machine can by found from the real and ideal 

mechanical advantages.

carrying boxes to a storage loft that is 12 m above

elastic potential energyThe word 
energy
is used in many different ways in everyday speech.
Some fruit-and-cereal bars are advertised as energy sources. Athletes
use energy in sports. Companies that supply your home with electricity,

natural gas, or heating fuel are called energy companies. 
Scientists and engineers use the term energy
much more precisely. As you
learned in the last chapter, work causes a change in the energy of a system.

That is, work transfers energy between a system and the external world. 
In this chapter, you will explore how objects can have energy in a vari-
ety of ways. 
Energy is like ice creamÑit comes in different varieties. You
can have vanilla, chocolate, or peach ice cream. They are different varieties,

but they are all ice cream and serve the same purpose. However, unlike ice

cream, energy can be changed from one variety to another. In this chapter,

you will learn how energy is transformed from one variety (or form) to

another and how to keep track of the changes.

285Horizons Companies284-292 CH11-S1-845813  3/11/04  2:45 AM  Page 285A Model of the Work-Energy Theorem
In the last chapter, you were introduced to the work-energy theorem.
You learned that when work is done on a system, the energy of that system
increases. On the other hand, if the system does work, then the energy of

the system decreases. These are abstract ideas, but keeping track of energy

is much like keeping track of your spending money. 
If you have a job, the amount of money that you have increases every
time you are paid. This process can be represented with a bar graph, as

shown in 
Figure 11-1a.
The orange bar represents how much money you
had to start with, and the blue bar represents the amount that you were

paid. The green bar is the total amount that you possess after the payment.

An accountant would say that your cash flow was positive. What happens

when you spend the money that you have? The total amount of money

that you have decreases. As shown in 
Figure 11-1b,
the bar that representsthe amount of money that you had before you bought that new CD is

higher than the bar that represents the amount of money remaining after
your shopping trip. The difference is the cost of the CD. Cash flow is

shown as a bar below the axis because it represents money going out,

which can be shown as a negative number. Energy is similar to your spend-

ing money. The amount of money that you have changes only when you

earn more or spend it. Similarly, energy can be stored, and when energy is

spent, it affects the motion of a system.
Throwing a ball
Gaining and losing energy also can be illustrated by
throwing and catching a ball. In Chapter 10, you learned that when you
exert a constant force, 
F, on an object through a distance, 
d, in the direc-tion of the force, you do an amount of work, represented by 
WFd. Thework is positive because the force and motion are in the same direction,

and the energy of the object increases by an amount equal to 
W.Supposethe object is a ball, and you exert a force to throw the ball. As a result of

the force you apply, the ball gains kine
tic energy. This process is shown in
Figure 11-2a.
You can again use a bar graph to represent the process. This
time, the height of the bar represents the amount of work, or energy, meas-

ured in joules. The kinetic 
energy after the work is done is equal to the sum
of the initial kinetic energy plus the work done on the ball.

1011kg strikes Earth at a speed of 
25.0 km/s. Find the kinetic energy of the comet in joules, and

the 4.21015J of energy that was released by the largest nuclear
weapon ever built. Figure 11-3
The diver does
work as she pushes off of the
diving board (a).This work
produces rotational kinetic energy

as she rotates about her center 

of mass (b)and she has linearkinetic energy when she slices
into the water (c).Catching a ballWhat happens when you catch a ball? Before hitting your
hands or glove, the ball is moving, so it has kineticc energy. In catching it,

you exert a force on the ball in the direction opposite to its motion.

Therefore, you do negative work on it, causing it to stop. Now that the ball

is not moving, it has no kinetic energy. This process and the bar graph that

represents it are shown in 
Figure 11-2b.
Kinetic energy is always positive,
so the initial kinetic energy of the ball is positive. The work done on the

ball is negative and the final kinetic energy is zero. Again, the kinetic

energy after the ball has stopped is equal to the sum of the initial kinetic
energy plus the work done on the ball.
Kinetic Energy
Recall that kinetic energy, 
KE12mv2, where mis the mass of the objectand vis the magnitude of its velocity. The kinetic energy is proportional to
the objectÕs mass. A 7.26-kg shot put thrown through the air has much
more kinetic energy than a 0.148-kg baseball with the same velocity,

because the shot put has a greater mass. The kinetic energy of an object 

is also proportional to the square of the objectÕs velocity. A car speeding at

20 m/s has four times the kinetic energy of the same car moving at 10 m/s.

Kinetic energy also can be due to rotational motion. If you spin a toy top

in one spot, does it have kinetic energy? You might say that it does not

because the top is not moving anywhere. However, to make the top rotate,

someone had to do work on it. Therefore, the top has 
rotational kineticenergy.
This is one of the several varieties of energy. Rotational kinetic 
energy can be calculated using KErot12I2, where Iis the objectÕs 
moment of inertia and is the objectÕs angular velocity. 
The diver, shown in 
Figure 11-3a,
does work as she pushes off of the
diving board. This work produces both linear and rotational kinetic ener-

gies. When the diverÕs center of mass moves as she leaps, linear kinetic

energy is produced. When she rotates about her center of mass, as shown

in Figure 11-3b,
rotational kinetic energy is produced. Because she is moving toward the water and rotating at the same time while in the tuck

position, she has both linear and rotational kinetic energy. When she slices

into the water, as shown in 
Figure 11-3c,
she has linear kinetic energy.
Ken Redmond/Ken Redmond Photography284-292 CH11-S1-845813  6/1/04  5:12 AM  Page 287Stored Energy
Imagine a group of boulders high on a hill. These boulders have been
lifted up by geological processes against the force of gravity; thus, they have
stored energy. In a rock slide, the boulders are shaken loose. They fall and

pick up speed as their stored energy is converted to kinetic energy. 
In the same way, a small, spring-loaded toy, such as a jack-in-the-box,
has stored energy, but the energy is stored in a compressed spring. While

both of these examples represent energy stored by mechanical means,

there are many other means of storing energy. Automobiles, for example,

carry their energy stored in the form of chemical energy in the gasoline
tank. Energy is made useful or causes motion when it changes from one
form to another.
How does the money model that was discussed earlier illustrate the
transformation of energy from one form to another? Money, too, can come

in different forms. You can have one five-dollar bill, 20 quarters, or 

500 pennies. In all of these cases, you still have five dollars. The height of

the bar graph in Figure 11-4
represents the amount of money in eachform. In the same way, you can use a bar graph to represent the amount of

energy in various forms that a system has.
Gravitational Potential Energy
Look at the oranges being juggled in Figure 11-5.
If you consider the
system to be only one orange, then it has several external forces acting 

on it. The force of the jugglerÕs hand does work, giving the orange its 

original kinetic energy. After the orange leaves the jugglerÕs hand, only the

force of gravity acts on it. How much work does gravity do on the orange

as its height changes?Work done by gravity
Let hrepresent the orangeÕs height measured from
the jugglerÕs hand. On the way up, its displacement is upward, but the
force on the orange, 
Fg, is downward, so the work done by gravity is nega-
tive: 
Wgmgh. On the way back down, the force and displacement are
in the same direction, so the work done by gravity is positive: 
Wgmgh.Thus, while the orange is moving upward, gravity does negative work,

slowing the orange to a stop. On the way back down, gravity does positive

work, increasing the orangeÕs speed and thereby increasing its kinetic

energy. The orange recovers all of the kinetic energy it originally had when

it returns to the height at which it left the jugglerÕs hand. It is as if the

orangeÕs kinetic energy is stored in another form as the ball rises and is

transformed back to kinetic energy as the ball falls.
Consider a system that consists of an object plus Earth. The gravitational
attraction between the object and Earth is a force that always does work on

the object as it moves. If the object moves away from Earth, energy is stored

in the system as a result of the gravitational force between the object and

Earth. This stored energy is called gravitational potential energy
and isrepresented by the symbol 
PE. The height to which the object has risen isdetermined by using a 
reference level,
the position where PEis defined tobe zero. For an object with mass, 
m, that has risen to a height, h, above the
reference level, gravitational potential energy is represented by the 

following equation.

289Potential Energy of an Atom
It is interesting to consider the
relative sizes of potential energy

per atom. For instance, a carbon

atom has a mass of about
21026kg. If you lift it 1 mabove the ground, its gravitational

potential energy is about 
21025J. The electrostatic
energy that holds the electrons 
on the atom has a value of about
1019J, and the nuclear potentialenergy that holds the nucleus
together is greater than 1012J.The nuclear potential energy is 

at least a million million times

greater than the gravitational

potential energy.

Kinetic energy and potential energy of a systemConsider the energy ofa system consisting of an orange used by the juggler plus Earth. The energy
in the system exists in two forms: kinetic energy and gravitational poten-

tial energy. At the beginning of the orangeÕs flight, all the energy is in the

form of kinetic energy, as shown in 
Figure 11-6a.
On the way up, as the
orange slows down, energy changes from kinetic energy to potential

energy. At the highest point of the orangeÕs flight, the velocity is zero. Thus,

all the energy is in the form of gravitational potential energy. On the way

back down, potential energy changes back into kinetic energy. The sum of

kinetic energy and potential energy is constant at all times because no
work is done on the system by any external forces.
Reference levels
In Figure 11-6a, the 
reference level is the jugglerÕs hand.
That is, the height of the orange is measured from the jugglerÕs hand. Thus,
at the jugglerÕs hand, 
h0 m and PE0 J. You can set the reference level
at any height that is convenient for solving a given problem.
Suppose the reference level is set at the highest point of the orangeÕs
flight. Then, h0 m and the systemÕs 
PE0 J at that point, as illustratedin Figure 11-6b.
The potential energy of the system is negative at the
beginning of the orangeÕs flight, zero at the highest point, and negative at

the end of the orangeÕs flight. If you were to calculate the total energy 

of the system represented in Figure 11-6a, it would be different from the

total energy of the system represented in Figure 11-6b. This is because the

reference levels are different in each case. However, the total energy of the

system in each situation would be constant at all times during the flight of

the orange. Only changes in energy determine the motion of a system. 
Gravitational Potential Energy
PEmghThe gravitational potential energy of an object is equal to the product of its
mass, the acceleration due to gravity, and the distance from the reference level.

orange is converted from one
form to another in various stages

291Elastic Potential Energy
When the string on the bow shown in

is pulled, work is
done on the bow, storing energy in it. Thus, the energy of the system
increases. Identify the system as the bow, the arrow, and Earth. When the

string and arrow are released, energy is changed into kinetic energy. The

stored energy in the pulled string is called elastic potential energy,
whichis often stored in rubber balls, rubber bands, slingshots, and trampolines.
Energy also can be stored in the bending of an object. When stiff metalor bamboo poles were used in pole-vaulting, the poles did not bend eas-

ily. Little work was done on the poles, and consequently, the poles did not

store much potential energy. Since flexible fiberglass poles were intro-

duced, however, record pole-vaulting heights have soared.

physicspp.com/self_check_quizA pole-vaulter runs with a flexible pole and plants its end into the 
socket in the ground. When the pole-vaulter bends the pole, as shown in
Figure 11-8
, some of the pole-vaulterÕs kinetic energy is converted to elas-
tic potential energy. When the pole straightens, the elastic potential energy

is converted to gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy as the

pole-vaulter is lifted as high as 6 m above the ground. Unlike stiff metal

poles or bamboo poles, fiberglass poles have an increased capacity for 

storing elastic potential energy. Thus, pole-vaulters are able to clear bars

that are set very high. 
MassAlbert Einstein recognized yet another form of potential energy:
mass itself. He said that mass, by its very nature, is energy. This energy, 
E0,is called rest energy and is represented by the following famous formula. 
According to this formula, stretching a spring or bending a vaulting pole
causes the spring or pole to gain mass. In these cases, the change in mass
is too small to be detected. When forces within the nucleus of an atom are
involved, however, the energy released into other forms, such as kinetic

energy, by changes in mass can be quite large.
Rest Energy
E0mc2The rest energy of an object is equal to the objectÕs mass times the speed of
light squared.Figure 11-8

284-292 CH11-S1-845813  6/1/04  5:16 AM  Page 292Consider a ball near the surface of Earth. The sum of gravitational
potential energy and kinetic energy in that system is constant. As the
height of the ball changes, energy is converted from kinetic energy to

potential energy, but the total amount of energy stays the same. 
Conservation of Energy
In our everyday world, it may not seem as if energy is conserved. A
hockey puck eventually loses its kinetic energy and stops moving, even on

smooth ice. A pendulum stops swinging after some time. The money

model can again be used to illustrate what is happening in these cases.
Suppose you have a total of $50 in cash. One day, you count your
money and discover that you are $3 short. Would you assume that the

money just disappeared? You probably would try to remember whether

you spent it, and you might even search for it. In other words, rather than

giving up on the conservation of money, you would try to think of differ-

ent places where it might have gone.
Law of conservation of energy
Scientists do the same thing as you would
if you could not account for a sum of money. Whenever they observe
energy leaving a system, they look for new forms into which the energy

could have been transferred. This is because the total amount of energy in

a system remains constant as long as the system is closed and isolated from

external forces. The 
law of conservation of energy
states that in a closed,isolated system, energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, energy

is conserved. Under these conditions, energy changes from one form to

another while the total energy of the system remains constant. 
Conservation of mechanical energy
The sum of the kinetic energy andgravitational potential energy of a system is called 
mechanical energy.
Inany given system, if no other forms of energy are present, mechanical
energy is represented by the following equation. 
Imagine a system consisting of a 10.0-N ball and Earth, as shown in
Figure 11-9.
Suppose the ball is released from 2.00 m above the ground,
which you set to be the reference level. Because the ball is not yet moving,

it has no kinetic energy. Its potential energy is represented by the follow-

ing equation: PEmgh (10.0 N)(2.00 m) 
20.0 J
The ballÕs total mechanical energy, therefore, is 20.0 J. As the ball falls,
it loses potential energy and gains kinetic energy. When the ball is 1.00 m

above EarthÕs surface: 
PEmgh(10.0 N)(1.00 m) 
10.0 J.
Mechanical Energy of a System
EKEPEThe mechanical energy of a system is equal to the sum of the kinetic energy
and potential energy if no other forms of energy are present.

system consisting of the ball and Earth is closed and isolated because no
external forces are acting upon it. Hence, the total energy of the system, 
E,remains constant at 20.0 J.
EKEPE, so KEEPEKE20.0 J
10.0 J = 10.0 J
When the ball reaches ground level, its potential energy is zero, and its
kinetic energy is 20.0 J. The equation that describes conservation of

mechanical energy can be written as follows.
What happens if the ball does not fall down, but rolls down a ramp, as
shown in 
Figure 11-10?
If there is no friction, there are no external forcesacting on the system. Thus, the system remains closed and isolated. The

ball still moves down a vertical distance of 2.00 m, so its loss of potential

energy is 20.0 J. Therefore, it gains 20.0 J of kinetic energy. As long as there

is no friction, the path that the ball takes does not matter.
Roller coastersIn the case of a roller coaster that is nearly at rest at thetop of the first hill, the total mechanical energy in the system is the
coasterÕs gravitational potential energy at that point. Suppose some other

hill along the track were higher than the first one. The roller coaster would

not be able to climb the higher hill because the energy required to do so
would be greater than the total mechanical energy of the system. 
SkiingSuppose you ski down a steep slope. When you begin from rest at
the top of the slope, your total mechanical energy is simply your gravita-
tional potential energy. Once you start skiing downhill, your gravitational

potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. As you ski down the slope,

your speed increases as more of your potential energy is converted to

kinetic energy. In ski jumping, the height of the ramp determines the

amount of energy that the jumper has to convert into kinetic energy at the

beginning of his or her flight. Pendulums
The simple oscillation of a pendulum also demonstrates conservation of energy. The system is the pendulum bob and Earth.
Usually, the reference level is chosen to be the height of the bob at the low-

est point, when it is at rest. If an external force pulls the bob to one side,

the force does work that gives the system mechanical energy. At the instant

the bob is released, all the energy is in the form of potential energy, but 

as the bob swings downward, the energy is converted to kinetic energy.

Figure 11-11
shows a graph of the changing potential and kinetic energies of
a pendulum. When the bob is at the lowest point, its gravitational poten-

tial energy is zero, and its kinetic energy is equal to the total mechanicalConservation of Mechanical Energy

is constant if we assume that there is no friction. You will learn more about

pendulums in Chapter 14.Loss of mechanical energyThe oscillations of a pendulum eventually
come to a stop, a bouncing ball comes to rest, and the heights of roller-coaster hills get lower and lower. Where does the mechanical energy in

such systems go? Any object moving through the air experiences the forces

of air resistance. In a roller coaster, there are frictional forces between the

wheels and the tracks. 
When a ball bounces off of a surface, all of the elastic potential energy
that is stored in the deformed ball is not converted back into kinetic energy

after the bounce.  Some of the energy is converted into thermal energy and

sound energy. As in the cases of the pendulum and the roller coaster, some

of the original mechanical energy in the system is converted into another

form of energy within members of the system or transmitted to energy 

outside the system, as in air resistance. Usually, this new energy causes 

the temperature of objects to rise slightly. You will learn more about this

form of energy, called 
thermal energy,
in Chapter 12. The following
strategies will be helpful to you when solving problems related to conser-

vation of energy. 
Conservation of Energy
When solving problems related to the conservation of energy, use the
following strategies. 1.Carefully identify the system. Make sure it is closed. In a closedsystem, no objects enter or leave the system. 
2.Identify the forms of energy in the system.3.Identify the initial and final states of the system. 
4.Is the system isolated? a.If there are no external forces acting 
on the system, then the system is 
isolated and the total energy of 

the system is constant.

In a belly-flop diving contest, the winner is the diver who makes the biggest splash upon

hitting the water. The size of the splash depends not only on the diverÕs style, but also 

on the amount of kinetic energy that the diver has. Consider a contest in which each

diver jumps from a 3.00-m platform. One diver has a mass of 136 kg and simply steps 

off the platform. Another diver has a mass of 102 kg and leaps upward from the

Two moving
objects can have different types of
collisions. Case 1: the two objects

move apart in opposite directions.
Analyzing Collisions
A collision between two objects, whether the objects are automobiles,
hockey players, or subatomic particles, is one of the most common situa-

tions analyzed in physics. Because the details of a collision can be very

complex during the collision itself, the strategy is to find the motion of the
objects just before and just after the collision. What conservation laws can

be used to analyze such a system? If the system is isolated, then momentum

and energy are conserved. However, the potential energy or thermal energy

in the system may decrease, remain the same, or increase. Therefore, you

cannot predict whether or not kinetic energy is conserved. 
Figure 11-12
and Figure 11-13
on the next page show three different kinds of collisions.
In case 1, the momentum of the system before and after the collision is

represented by the following:
Thus, in case 1, the momentum is conserved. Look again at Figure 11-13
and verify for yourself that momentum is conserved in cases 2 and 3.

Bar graphs can 
be drawn to represent the three
kinds of collisions.Next, consider the kinetic energy of the system in each of these cases. For
case 1 the kinetic energy of the system before and after the collision is 

represented by the following equations:
In case 1, the kinetic energy of the system increased. If energy in the sys-
tem is conserved, then one or more of the other forms of energy must have

decreased. Perhaps when the two carts collided, a compressed spring was

released, adding kinetic energy to the system. This kind of collision is

sometimes called a superelastic or explosive collision. 
After the collision in case 2, the kinetic energy is equal to:KECfKEDf(1.0 kg)(0.00 m/s)212(1.0 kg)(1.0 m/s)20.50 J
Kinetic energy remained the same after the collision. This type of collision, in which the kinetic energy does not change, is called an 
elasticcollision.Collisions between hard, elastic objects, such as those made of
steel, glass, or hard plastic, often are called nearly elastic collisions. 
After the collision in case 3, the kinetic energy is equal to:KECfKEDf12(1.00 kg)(0.50 m/s)
212(1.00 kg)(0.50 m/s)
20.25 JKinetic energy decreased and some of it was converted to thermal
energy. This kind of collision, in which kinetic energy decreases, is called

an inelastic collision.Objects made of soft, sticky material, such as clay,
act in this way. 
The three kinds of collisions can be represented using bar graphs, such
as those shown in 
Figure 11-14.
Although the kinetic energy before andafter the collisions can be calculated, only the change in other forms of
energy can be found. In automobile collisions, kinetic energy is transferred

into other forms of energy, such as heat and sound.

In collisions, you can see how momentum and energy are really very 
different. Momentum is almost always conserved in a collision. Energy is
conserved only in elastic collisions. Momentum is what makes objects

stop. A 10.0-kg object moving at 5.00 m/s will stop a 20.0-kg object 

moving at 2.50 m/s if they have a head-on collision. However, in this case,

the smaller object has much more kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of the

smaller object is KE12(10.0 kg)(5.0 m/s)
2125 J. The kinetic energy ofthe larger object is KE1
2(20.0 kg)(2.50 m/s)
262.5 J. Based on thework-energy theorem, you can conclude that it takes more work to make the
10.0-kg object move at 5.00 m/s than it does to move the 20.0-kg object at

2.50 m/s. It sometimes is said that in automobile collisions, the momentum

stops the cars but it is the energy in the collision that causes the damage.
It also is possible to have a collision in which nothing collides. If two
lab carts sit motionless on a table, connected by a compressed spring, their

total momentum is zero. If the spring is released, the carts will be forced
to move away from each other. The potential energy of the spring will be

transformed into the kinetic energy of the carts. The carts will still move

away 
from each other so that their total momentum is zero.293-301 CH11-S2-845813  6/10/04  7:46 PM  Page 300physicspp.com/self_check_quizSection 11.2Conservation of Energy

the floor and bounces repeatedly. Each time it hits

fallen half the distance, or 10 m, half of its energy is

potential and half is kinetic. When the ball has fallen

for half the amount of time it takes to fall, will more,

less, or exactly half of its energy be potential energy?

It is useful to remember two simple examples of collisions. One is the
elastic collision between two objects of equal mass, such as when a cue ball
with velocity, 
v, hits a motionless billiard ball head-on. In this case, after
the collision, the cue ball is motionless and the other ball rolls off at 
velocity, 
v. It is easy to prove that both momentum and energy are 
conserved in this collision.
The other simple example is to consider a skater of mass m, with velocity 
v, running into another skater of equal mass who happens to bestanding motionless on the ice. If they hold on to each other after the 

collision, they will slide off at a velocity of 
12vbecause of the conservation
of momentum. The final kinetic energy of the pair would be equal to 
KE12(2m)(12v)214mv2, which is half the initial kinetic energy. This is
because the collision was inelastic. 
You have investigated examples in which the conservation of energy,
and sometimes the conservation of momentum, can be used to calculate
the motions of a system of objects. These systems would be too compli-

cated to comprehend using only NewtonÕs second law of motion. The

understanding of the forms of energy and how energy flows from one form

to another is one of the most useful concepts in science. The term 
energy
conservationappears in everything from scientific papers to electric appli-
ance commercials. Scientists use the concept of energy to explore topics

much more complicated than colliding billiard balls.

There are many examples of situations where energy is conserved. One such
example is a rock falling from a given height. If the rock starts at rest, at the

moment the rock is dropped, it only has potential energy. As it falls, its potential

energy decreases as its height decreases, but its kinetic energy increases. The sum

of potential energy and kinetic energy remains constant if friction is neglected.
When the rock is about to hit the ground, all of its potential energy has been 
converted to kinetic energy. In this experiment, you will model a falling object

and calculate its speed as it hits the ground.QUESTION
How does the transfer of an objectÕs potential energy to kinetic

energy demonstrate conservation of energy?

Running SmarterRunning SmarterThe Physics of Running Shoes
TodayÕs
running shoes are high-tech marvels. They
enhance performance and protect your body

by acting as 
shock absorbers. 
How do running
shoes help you win a race? They

reduce your energy consumption,

as well as allow you to use energy

more efficiently. Good running

shoes must be flexible enough to
bend with your feet as you run,

support your feet, and hold them

in place. They must be light-

weight and provide traction to

prevent slipping. 
Running Shoes as Shock
AbsorbersToday, much of the
focus of running shoe technologycenters on the cushioned midsolethat plays a key role as a shock-

absorber and performance
enhancer. Each time a runnerÕs

foot hits the ground, the ground
exerts an equal and opposite
force on the runnerÕs foot. 

This force can be nearly four
times a runnerÕs weight,

causing aches and pains,

shin splints, and dam-

age to knees and
ankles over long

distances. 
Cushioning isused in running
shoes to decrease
the force absorbed
by the runner. As

a runnerÕs foot hits the ground and comes to a

stop, its momentum changes. The change in

momentum is pFt, where Fis the forceon that object and tis the time during whichthe force acts.  The cushioning causes the

change of momentum to occur over an

extended time and reduces the force of the 
foot on the ground. The decreased force
reduces the damage to the runnerÕs body. 
Running Shoes Boost Performance
A shoeÕs cushioning system also affects energy

consumption. The bones, muscles, ligaments,
and tendons of the foot and leg are a natural
cushioning system. But operating this system

requires the body to use stored energy to 
contract muscles. So if a shoe can be worn 
that assists a runnerÕs natural

cushioning system, the 

runner does not expend 
as much of his or her own

stored energy. The energy the

runner saved can be spent to

run farther or faster. 
The cushioned midsoleuses the law of conservation

of energy to return as much
of the energy to the runner
as possible. The runnerÕs

kinetic energy transforms to
elastic potential energy, plus

heat, when the runnerÕs foot

hits the running surface. If

the runner can reduce the
amount of energy that is lost
as heat, the runnerÕs elastic

potential energy can be 
converted back to useful

kinetic energy. 
Bouncy, springy, elastic materi-
als that resist crushing over time
commonly are used to create thecushioned midsole. Options now
range from silicon gel pads tocomplex fluid-filled systems and
even springs to give a runner
extra energy efficiency.
UpperInsertOutsoleMidsole1.Use Scientific ExplanationsUsephysics to explain why manufacturers putcushioned midsoles in running shoes. 
2.AnalyzeWhich surface would provide
more cushioning when running: a
grassy field or a concrete sidewalk?
Explain why that surface provides 

better cushioning. 3.Research

Key Concepts
¥The kinetic energy of an object is proportional to its mass and the square ofits velocity. 
¥The rotational kinetic energy of an object is proportional to the objectÕs

moment of inertia and the square of its angular velocity.
¥When Earth is included in a system, the work done by gravity is replaced by

gravitational potential energy. 
¥The gravitational potential energy of an object depends on the objectÕs

weight and its distance from EarthÕs surface.
¥The reference level is the position where the gravitational potential energy 

is defined to be zero.¥Elastic potential energy may be stored in an object as a result of its change 

in shape. 
¥Albert Einstein recognized that mass itself has potential energy. This energy 

is called rest energy. 
E0mc2PEmghKey Concepts
¥The sum of kinetic and potential energy is called mechanical energy. 
¥If no objects enter or leave a system, the system is considered to be a 

closed system. 
¥If there are no external forces acting on a system, the system is considered 

to be an isolated system. 
¥The total energy of a closed, isolated system is constant. Within the system,

energy can change form, but the total amount of energy does not change.

Thus, energy is conserved.
¥The type of collision in which the kinetic energy after the collision is less
than the kinetic energy before the collision is called an inelastic collision.¥The type of collision in which the kinetic energy before and after the
collision is the same is called an elastic collision. ¥Momentum is conserved in collisions if the external force is zero. The

mechanical energy may be unchanged or decreased by the collision,

depending on whether the collision is elastic or inelastic.KEbeforePEbeforeKEafterPEafterEKEPE 305-311 CH11-SG CA STP-845813  3/11/04  5:14 AM  Page 305306Chapter 11Energy and Its Conservation

The study of heat transformations into other forms of energy, called
thermodynamics, began with the eighteenth-century engineers who
built the first steam engines. These steam engines were used to power

trains, factories, and water pumps for coal mines, and thus they contributed

greatly to the Industrial Revolution in Europe and in the United States. In

learning to design more efficient engines, the engineers developed new

concepts about how heat is related to useful work. Although the study of

thermodynamics began in the eighteenth century, it was not until around

1900 that the concepts of thermodynamics were linked to the motions of

atoms and molecules in solids, liquids, and gases. 
Today, the concepts of thermodynamics are widely used in various
applications that involve heat and temperature. Engineers use the laws of

thermodynamics to continually develop higher performance refrigerators,

automobile engines, aircraft engines, and numerous other machines.

You already have studied how objects collide and trade kinetic energies.
For example, the many molecules present in a gas have linear and rota-
tional kinetic energies. The molecules also may have potential energy in

their vibrations and bending. The gas molecules collide with each other
and with the walls of their container, transferring energy among each other

in the process. There are numerous molecules moving freely in a gas,

resulting in many collisions. Therefore, it is convenient to discuss the total

energy of the molecules and the average energy per molecule. The total

energy of the molecules is called thermal energy, and the average energy

per molecule is related to the temperature of the gas.
Hot objectsWhat makes an object hot? When you fill up a balloon with
helium, the rubber in the balloon is stretched by the repeated pounding
from helium atoms. Each of the billions of helium atoms in the balloon

collides with the rubber wall, bounces back, and hits the other side of the

balloon, as shown in 
Figure 12-1.If you put a balloon in sunlight, you
might notice that the balloon gets slightly larger. The energy from the Sun

makes each of the gas atoms move faster and bounce off the rubber walls

of the balloon more often. Each atomic collision with the balloon wall

puts a greater force on the balloon and stretches the rubber. Thus, the bal-

loon expands. 
On the other hand, if you refrigerate a balloon, you will find that it
shrinks slightly. Lowering the temperature slows the movement of the

helium atoms. Hence, their collisions do not transfer enough momentum

to stretch the balloon quite as much. Even though the balloon contains the

same number of atoms, the balloon shrinks.
SolidsThe atoms in solids also have kinetic energy, but they are unable to
move freely as gas atoms do. One way to illustrate the molecular structure
of a solid is to picture a number of atoms that are connected to each other
by springs. Because of the springs, the atoms bounce back and forth, with

some bouncing more than others. Each atom has some kinetic energy and

some potential energy from the springs that are attached to it. If a solid has
Nnumber of atoms, then the total thermal energy in the solid is equal to
the average kinetic and potential energy per atom times 
N. Thermal Energy and Temperature
According to the previous discussion of gases and solids, a hot object has
more thermal energy than a similar cold object, as shown in 
Figure 12-2.This means that, as a whole, the particles in a hot object have greater 

thermal energy than the particles in a cold object. This does not mean that
all the particles in an object have exactly the same amount of energy; they

have a wide range of energies. However, the average energy of the particles

in a hot object is higher than the average energy of the particles in a 

cold object. To understand this, consider the heights of students in 

a twelfth-grade class. Although the studentsÕ heights vary, you can calculate

the average height of the students in the class. This average is likely to 

be greater than the average height of students in a ninth-grade class, even

though some ninth-grade students may be taller than some twelfth-grade

students.

312-322 CH12-S1-845813  6/3/04  2:50 PM  Page 314Temperature
Temperature depends only on the average kinetic energy of
the particles in the object. Because temperature depends on average kinetic
energy, it does not depend on the number of atoms in an object. To under-

stand this, consider two blocks of steel. The first block has a mass of 1 kg,

and the second block has a mass of 2 kg. If the 1-kg block is at the same
temperature as the 2-kg block, the average kinetic energy of the particles in

each block is the same. However, the 2-kg block has twice the mass of the

1-kg block. Hence, the 2-kg block has twice the amount of particles as the 1-

kg block. Thus, the total amount of kinetic energy of the particles in the 2-

kg block is twice that of the 1-kg mass. Total kinetic energy is divided by

the total number of particles in an object to calculate its average kinetic

energy. Therefore, the thermal energy in an object is proportional to the

number of particles in it. Temperature, however, is not dependent on the

number of particles in an object.Equilibrium and Thermometry
How do you measure your body temperature? For example, if you sus-
pect that you have a fever, you might place a thermometer in your mouth
and wait for a few minutes before checking the thermometer for your 

temperature reading. The microscopic process involved in measuring 

temperature involves collisions and energy transfers between the ther-

mometer and your body. Your body is hot compared to the thermometer,

which means that the particles in your body have greater thermal energy

and are moving faster than the particles in the thermometer. When the

cold glass tube of the thermometer touches your skin, which is warmer

than the glass, the faster-moving particles in your skin collide with the

slower-moving particles in the glass. Energy is then transferred from your

skin to the glass particles by the process of 
conduction,which is the transfer of kinetic energy when particles collide. The thermal energy of 

the particles that make up the thermometer increases, while at the same

time, the thermal energy of the particles in your skin decreases.
Thermal equilibrium
As the particles in the glass gain more energy, they
begin to give some of their energy back to the particles in your body. At
some point, the rate of transfer of energy between the glass and your body

becomes equal, and your body and the thermometer are then at the same

temperature. At this point, your body and the thermometer are said to have

reached thermal equilibrium,the state in which the rate of energy flow
between two objects is equal and the objects are at the same temperature,

as shown in 
Figure 12-3.The operation of a thermometer depends on some property, such as vol-
ume, which changes with temperature. Many household thermometers
contain colored alcohol that expands when heated and rises in a narrow

tube. The hotter the thermometer, the more the alcohol expands and the

higher it rises in the tube. In liquid-crystal thermometers, such as the one

shown in 
Figure 12-4,a set of different kinds of liquid crystals is used. Each
crystalÕs molecules rearrange at a specific 
temperature, which causes the
color of the crystal to change and indicates the temperature by color.

Medical thermometers and the thermometers that monitor automobile
engines use very small, temperature-sensitive electronic circuits to take

rapid measurements.

Temperature Scales: Celsius and Kelvin
Over the years, scientists developed temperature scales so that they could
compare their measurements with those of other scientists. A scale based
on the properties of water was devised in 1741 by Swedish astronomer and

physicist Anders Celsius. On this scale, now called the Celsius scale, the

freezing point of pure water is defined to be 0
°C. The boiling point of purewater at sea level is defined to be 100
°C. Temperature limits
The wide range of temperatures present in the uni-verse is shown in 
Figure 12-5.Temperatures do not appear to have an
upper limit. The interior of the Sun is at least 1.5107°C. Temperatures do,
however, have a lower limit. Generally, materials contract as they cool. If

an ideal gas, such as the helium in a balloon is cooled, it contracts in 

such a way that it occupies a volume that is only the size of the helium

atoms at 273.15°C. At this temperature, all the thermal energy that can
be removed has been removed from the gas. It is impossible to reduce the

temperature any further. Therefore, there can be no temperature lower than

273.15°C, which is called absolute zero.The Celsius scale is useful for day-to-day measurements of temperature.
It is not conducive for working on science and engineering problems, how-

ever, because it has negative temperatures. Negative temperatures suggest 

a molecule could have negative kinetic energy, which is not possible

because kinetic energy is always positive. The solution to this issue is to 

use a temperature scale based on absolute zero.The zero point of the Kelvin scale is defined to be absolute zero. On the
Kelvin scale, the freezing point of water (0
°C) is about 273 K and the boilingpoint of water is about 373 K. Each interval on this scale, called a kelvin, is
equal to 1°C. Thus, 
TC273TK. Figure 12-6shows representative tem-
peratures on the three most-common scales: Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.
Very cold temperatures are reached by liquefying gases. Helium liquefies
at 4.2 K, or 269°C. Even colder temperatures can be reached by making
use of special properties of solids, helium isotopes, and atoms and lasers.

temperatures throughout the

Steam HeatingIn a steamheating system of a building,water is turned into steam in a
boiler located in a maintenance

area or the basement. The steam

then flows through insulated pipes

to each room in the building. 
In the radiator, the steam is

condensed as liquid water and
then flows back through pipes 

to the boiler to be revaporized.
The hot steam physically carries

the heat from the boiler, and that

energy is released when the
steam condenses in the radiator.

Some disadvantages of steam

heating are that it requires

expensive boilers and pipes must

contain steam under pressure.
Section 12.1Temperature and Thermal Energy
317Heat and the Flow of Thermal Energy
When two objects come in contact with each other, they transfer energy.
This energy that is transferred between the objects is called 
heat.Heat isdescribed as the energy that always flows from the hotter object to the

cooler object. Left to itself heat never flows from a colder object to a 

hotter object. The symbol 
Qis used to represent an amount of heat, which,like other forms of energy, is measured in joules. If 
Qhas a negative value,
heat has left the object; if Qhas a positive value, heat has been absorbed
by the object. 
ConductionIf you place one end of a metal rod in a flame, the hot gas
particles in the flame conduct heat to the rod. The other end of the rod alsobecomes warm within a short period of time. Heat is conducted because

the particles in the rod are in direct contact with each other.
Convection
Thermal energy transfer can occur even if the particles in an
object are not in direct contact with each other. Have you ever looked into
a pot of water just about to boil? The water at the bottom of the pot is

heated by conduction and rises to the top, while the colder water at the top

sinks to the bottom. Heat flows between the rising hot water and the

descending cold water. This motion of fluid in a liquid or gas caused by 

temperature differences is called convection.
Atmospheric turbulence is
caused by convection of gases in the atmosphere. Thunderstorms are excel-

lent examples of large-scale atmospheric convection. Ocean currents that

cause changes in weather patterns also result from convection.
RadiationThe third method of thermal transfer, unlike the first two, does
not depend on the presence of matter. The Sun warms Earth from over 
150 million km 
away 
via radiation,which is the transfer of energy by 
electromagnetic waves. 
These waves carry the energy from the hot Sun
through the vacuum of space to the much cooler Earth. 
Specific Heat
Some objects are easier to heat than others. On a bright summer day, the
Sun warms the sand on a beach and the ocean water. However, the sand

on the beach gets quite hot, while the ocean water stays relatively cool.

When heat flows into an object, its thermal energy and temperature

increase. The amount of the increase in temperature depends on the size

of the object and on the material from which the object is made.

the temperature of a unit mass by

one temperature unit. In SI units,

specific heat, represented by 
C, ismeasured in J/kgK. Table 12-1
provides values of specific heat 

for some common substances. For

example, 897 J must be added to 

1 kg of aluminum to raise its 
temperature by 1 K. The specific

heat of aluminum is therefore 
897 J/kgK.The heat gained or lost by an object as its temperature changes depends
on the mass, the change in temperature, and the specific heat of the sub-

stance. By using the following equation, you can calculate the amount of

heat, Q, that must be transferred to change the temperature of an object.Liquid water has a high specific heat compared to the other substance in

Table 12-1. When the temperature of 10.0 kg of water is increased by 

5.0 K, the heat absorbed is Q(10.0 kg)(4180 J/kg
K)(5.0 K) = 2.1105J.Remember that the temperature interval for kelvins is the same as that for

Celsius degrees. For this reason, you can calculate 
Tin kelvins or indegrees Celsius.

319Calorimetry: 
Measuring Specific Heat
A simple calorimeter, such as the one shown in
Figure 12-7,is a device used to measure changes inthermal energy. A calorimeter is carefully insulated
so that heat transfer to the external world is kept 

to a minimum. A measured mass of a substance
that has been heated to a high temperature is
placed in the calorimeter. The calorimeter also 

contains a known mass of cold water at a measured

temperature. The heat released by the substance 

is transferred to the cooler water. The change in

thermal energy of the substance is calculated using
the resulting increase in the water temperature.

More sophisticated types of calorimeters are used to
measure chemical reactions and the energy content
of various foods.
The operation of a calorimeter depends on theconservation of energy in an isolated, closed system.

Energy can neither enter nor leave this system. As a

result, if the energy of one part of the system

increases, the energy of another part of 
the system must decrease by the
same amount. Consider a system composed 
of two blocks of metal, block
A and block B, shown in 
Figure 12-8aon the next page. The total energy
of the system is constant, as represented by the following equation.

A system iscomposed of two model blocks at different temperatures that

initially are separated (a).When
the blocks are brought together,

heat flows from the hotter block to
the colder block (b). Total energy
remains constant.
Suppose that the two blocks initially are separated but can be placed in
contact with each other. If the thermal energy of block A changes by an

amount EA, then the change in thermal energy of block B, EB, must berelated by the equation, 
EAEB0. Thus, 
EA
EB. The change in energy of one block is positive, while the change in energy of the other

block is negative. For the block whose thermal energy change is positive,

the temperature of the block rises. For the block whose thermal energy

change is negative, the temperature falls.
Assume that the initial temperatures of the two blocks are different.
When the blocks are brought together, heat flows from the hotter block 

to the colder block, as shown in 
Figure 12-8b.
The heat flow continues
until the blocks are in thermal equilibrium, which is when the blocks have

the same temperature.
In an isolated, closed system, the change in thermal energy is equal to
the heat transferred because no work is done. Therefore, the change in

energy for each block can be expressed by the following equation:
EQmCTThe increase in thermal energy of block A is equal to the decrease inthermal energy of block B. Thus, the following relationship is true:

tures. Most are cold-blooded animals whose body temperatures depend

on the environment. The others are warm-blooded animals whose body

temperatures are controlled internally. That is, a warm-blooded animalÕs

body temperature remains stable regardless of the temperature of the envi-
ronment. In contrast, when the temperature of the environment is high,
the body temperature of a cold-blooded animal also becomes high. A
cold-blooded animal, such as the lizard shown in 
Figure 12-9,regulatesthis heat flow by hiding under a rock or crevice, thereby reducing its body

temperature. Humans are warm-blooded and have a body temperature of

about 37°C. To regulate its body temperature, a warm-blooded 
animal increases or decreases the level of its metabolic processes. Thus, a

warm-blooded animal may hibernate in winter and reduce its body tem-

perature to approach the freezing point of water.

Eighteenth-century steam-engine builders used heat to turn liquidwater into steam. The steam pushed a piston to turn the engine, and
then the steam was cooled and condensed into a liquid again. Adding heat

to the liquid water changed not only its temperature, but also its structure.

You will learn that changing state means changing form as well as chang-

ing the way in which atoms store thermal energy.
Changes of State
The three most common states of matter are solids, liquids, and gases.
As the temperature of a solid is raised, it usually changes to a liquid. At

even higher temperatures, it becomes a gas. How can these changes be

explained? Consider a material in a solid state. When the thermal energy

of the solid is increased, the motion of the particles also increases, as does
the temperature.
Figure 12-10
diagrams the changes of state as thermal energy is addedto 1.0 g of water starting at 243 K (ice) and continuing until it reaches 

473 K (steam). Between points A and B, the ice is warmed to 273 K. At

some point, the added thermal energy causes the particles to move rapidly

enough that their motion overcomes the forces holding the particles

together in a fixed location. The particles are still touching each other, but

they have more freedom of movement. Eventually, the particles become

free enough to slide past each other. 
Melting pointAt this point, the substance has changed from a solid to a
liquid. The temperature at which this change occurs is the melting point ofthe substance. When a substance is melting, all of the added thermal

energy goes to overcome the forces holding the particles together in the

solid state. None of the added thermal energy increases the kinetic energy of

the particles. This can be observed between points B and C in Figure 12-10,

where the added thermal energy melts the ice at a constant 273 K. Becausethe kinetic energy of the particles does not increase, the temperature does

not increase between points B and C.
Boiling pointOnce a solid is completely melted,there are no more forces holding the particles inthe solid state. Adding more thermal energy 

again increases the motion of the particles, and

the temperature of the liquid rises. In the 

diagram, this process occurs between points C

and D. As the temperature increases further, some

particles in the liquid acquire enough energy to 
break free from the other particles. At a specific

temperature, known as the boiling point, further

addition of energy causes the substance to
undergo another change of state. All the added

thermal energy converts the substance from the

liquid state to the gaseous state.

323-331 CH12-S2-845813  6/3/04  2:57 PM  Page 323As in melting, the temperaturedoes not rise while a liquid boils. In
Figure 12-10, this transition is repre-

sented between points D and E. After

the material is entirely converted to

gas, any added thermal energy again

increases the motion of the particles,

and the temperature rises. Above

point E, steam is heated to tempera-
tures greater than 373 K.Heat of fusionThe amount of energyneeded to melt 1 kg of a substance iscalled the heat of fusionof that sub-stance. For example, the heat of

fusion of ice is 3.34105J/kg. If 1 kgof ice at its melting point, 273 K, absorbs 3.34105J, the ice becomes 1 kgof water at the same temperature, 273 K. The added energy causes a change

in state but not in temperature. The horizontal distance in Figure 12-10

from point B to point C represents the heat of fusion.Heat of vaporization
At normal atmospheric pressure, water boils at 373
K. The thermal energy needed to vaporize 1 kg of a liquid is called the 
heatof vaporization.
For water, the heat of vaporization is 2.26
106J/kg. Thedistance from point D to point E in Figure 12-10 represents the heat of
vaporization. Every material has a characteristic heat of vaporization.
Between points A and B, there is a definite slope to the line as the tem-
perature is raised. This slope represents the specific heat of the ice. The

slope between points C and D represents the specific heat of water, and the

slope above point E represents the specific heat of steam. Note that the

slope for water is less than those of both ice and steam. This is because

water has a greater specific heat than does ice or steam. The heat, 
Q,required to melt a solid of mass mis given by the following equation. 
Similarly, the heat, 
Q, required to vaporize a mass, 
m, of liquid is given
by the following equation.
When a liquid freezes, an amount of heat, 
QmHf, must be removed
from the liquid to turn it into a solid. The negative sign indicates that the

heat is transferred from the sample to the external world. In the same way,

when a vapor condenses to a liquid, an amount of heat, 
QmHv, mustbe removed from the vapor. The values of some heats of fusion, 
Hf, andheats of vaporization, 
Hv, are shown in 
Table 12-2.
Heat Required to Vaporize a Liquid
QmHvThe heat required to vaporize a liquid is equal to the mass of the liquid times
the heat of vaporization of the liquid. Heat Required to Melt a Solid
QmHfThe heat required to melt a solid is equal to the mass of the solid times the

heat of fusion of the solid. Table 12-2

Cold reservoir at TLHot reservoir at THHeatengineQHQH  W  QLQLWThe First Law of Thermodynamics
Before thermal energy was linked to the motion of atoms, the study of
heat and temperature was considered to be a separate science. The first law
developed for this science was a statement about what thermal energy is

and where it can go. As you know, you can heat a nail by holding it over a

flame or by pounding it with a hammer. That is, you can increase the nailÕs

thermal energy by adding heat or by doing work on it. We do not normally

think that the nail does work on the hammer. However, the work done by

the nail on the hammer is equal to the negative of the work done by the

hammer on the nail. The first law of thermodynamics
states that thechange in thermal energy, 
U, of an object is equal to the heat, Q, that isadded to the object minus the work, 
W, done by the object. Note that 
U,Q, and Ware all measured in joules, the unit of energy.
Thermodynamics also involves the study of the changes in thermal
properties of matter. The first law of thermodynamics is merely a restatement

of the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy is neither 

created nor destroyed, but can be changed into other forms.
Another example of changing the amount of thermal energy in a system
is a hand pump used to inflate a bicycle tire. As a person pumps, the air

and the hand pump become warm. The mechanical energy in the moving

piston is converted into thermal energy of the gas. Similarly, other forms

of energy, such as light, sound, and electric energy, can be changed into

thermal energy. For example, a toaster converts electric energy into heat

when it toasts bread, and the Sun warms Earth with light from a distance

of over 150 million km away.
Heat enginesThe warmth that you experience when you rub your hands
together is a result of the conversion of mechanical energy into thermal
energy. The conversion of mechanical energy into thermal energy occurs

easily. However, the reverse process, the conversion of thermal energy into

mechanical energy, is more difficult. A device that is able to continuously

convert thermal energy to mechanical energy  is called a 
heat engine.
A heat engine requires a high-temperature source from which thermalenergy can be removed; a low-temperature receptacle, called a sink, into

which thermal energy can be delivered; and a way to convert the thermal

energy into work. A diagram of a heat engine is shown in 
Figure 12-11.
An automobile internal-combustion engine, such as the one shown in

Figure 12-12,is one example of a heat engine. In the engine, a mixture of
air and gasoline vapor is ignited and produces a high-temperature flame.

Input heat, QH, flows from the flame to the air in the cylinder. The hot air
expands and pushes on a piston, thereby changing thermal energy into

mechanical energy. To obtain continuous mechanical energy, the engine

must be returned to its starting condition. The heated air is expelled and
replaced by new air, and the piston is returned to the top of the cylinder.
The First Law of Thermodynamics
UQWThe change in thermal energy of an object is equal to the heat added to the
object minus the work done by the object.Figure 12-11

energy and low-temperaturewaste heat. 323-331 CH12-S2-845813  6/10/04  4:58 PM  Page 326Section 12.2Changes of State and the Laws of Thermodynamics

vaporSpark plugPistonIntakeCompressionSparkPowerExhaust
ExhaustThe entire cycle is repeated many times each minute. The thermal energy
from the burning of gasoline is converted into mechanical energy, which

eventually results in the movement of the car.
Not all of the thermal energy from the high-temperature flame in anautomobile engine is converted into mechanical energy. When the auto-

mobile engine is functioning, the exhaust gases and the engine parts
become hot. As the exhaust comes in contact with outside air and transfers
heat to it, the temperature of the outside air is raised. In addition, heat
from the engine is transferred to a radiator. Outside air passes through the

radiator and the air temperature is raised.All of this energy, 
QL, transferred out of the automobile engine is calledwaste heat, that is, heat that has not been converted into work. When the

engine is working continuously, the internal energy of the engine does 

not change, or 
U0QW. The net heat going into the engine is QQHQL. Thus, the work done by the engine is 
WQHQL. In anautomobile engine, the thermal energy in the flame produces the mechan-

ical energy and the waste heat that is expelled. All heat engines generate

waste heat, and therefore no engine can ever convert all of the energy into

useful motion or work.
EfficiencyEngineers and car salespeople often talk about the fuel efficiencyof automobile engines. They are referring to the amount of the input heat,
QH, that is turned into useful work, 
W. The actual efficiency of an en
gineis given by the ratio 
W/QH. The efficiency could equal 100 percent only if allof the input heat were turned into work by the engine. Because there is

always waste heat, even the most efficient engines fall short of 100-percent

efficiency.
In solar collectors, heat is collected at high temperatures and used to
drive engines. The SunÕs energy is transmitted as electromagnetic waves

and increases the internal energy of the solar collectors. This energy is then 

transmitted as heat to the engine, where it is turned into useful work and

waste heat.
Refrigerators
Heat flows spontaneously from a warm object to a cold
object. However, it is possible to remove thermal energy from a colder
object and add it to a warmer object if work is done. A refrigerator is a com-

mon example of a device that accomplishes this transfer with the use of
mechanical work. Electric energy runs a motor that does work on a gas and

compresses it. 323-331 CH12-S2-845813  3/22/04  12:24 AM  Page 327328Chapter 12Thermal Energy

you circle the spoon in the cup. How many times would you have 

to stir the spoon to heat a 0.15-kg cup of tea by 2.0°C?26.How can the first law of thermodynamics be used to explain how 

to reduce the temperature of an object?The Second Law of Thermodynamics
Many processes that are consistent with the first law of thermodynam-
ics have never been observed to occur spontaneously. Three such processes
are presented in Figure 12-14.For example, the first law of thermody-
namics does not prohibit heat flowing from a cold object to a hot object.

However, when hot objects have been placed in contact with cold objects,

the hot objects have never been observed to become hotter. Similarly, the

cold objects have never been observed to become colder. 
Entropy
If heat engines completely converted thermal energy into
mechanical energy with no waste heat, then the first law of thermody-
namics would be obeyed. However, waste heat is always generated, and

randomly distributed particles of a gas are not observed to spontaneously

arrange themselves in specific ordered patterns. In the nineteenth century,

French engineer Sadi Carnot studied the ability of engines to convert ther-

mal energy into mechanical energy. He developed a logical proof that even

an ideal engine would generate some waste heat. CarnotÕs result is best

described in terms of a quantity called entropy,
which is a measure of thedisorder in a system. 
The gas draws heat from the interior of the refrigerator, passes from the
compressor through the condenser coils on the outside of the refrigerator,

and cools into a liquid. Thermal energy is transferred into the air in the
room. The liquid reenters the interior, vaporizes, and absorbs thermal

energy from its surroundings. The gas returns to the compressor and the

process is repeated. The overall change in the thermal energy of the gas is

zero. Thus, according to the first law of thermodynamics, the sum of the

heat removed from the refrigeratorÕs contents and the work done by the

motor is equal to the heat expelled, as shown in 
Figure 12-13.Heat pumpsA heat pump is a refrigerator that can be run in two direc-
tions. In the summer, the pump removes heat from a house and thus cools

the house. In the winter, heat is removed from the cold outside air and

transferred into the warmer house. In both cases, mechanical energy is

required to transfer heat from a cold object to a warmer one.

Many processes
that do not violate the first law ofthermodynamics do not occur
spontaneously. The spontaneous

processes obey both the first and
second law of thermodynamics.When a baseball is dropped and falls due to gravity, it possesses poten-
tial and kinetic energies that can be recovered to do work. However, when

the baseball falls through the air, it collides with many air molecules that

absorb some of its energy. This causes air molecules to move in random

directions and at random speeds. The energy absorbed from the baseball

causes more disorder among the molecules. The greater the range of speeds
exhibited by the molecules, the greater the disorder, which in turn increases

the entropy. It is highly unlikely that the molecules that have been dis-

persed in all directions will come back together, give their energies back to

the baseball, and cause it to rise. 
Entropy, like thermal energy, is contained in an object. If heat is 
added to an object, entropy is increased. If heat is removed from an object,

entropy is decreased. If an object does work with no change in tempera-

ture, the entropy does not change, as long as friction is ignored. The change

in entropy, 
S, is expressed by the following equation, in which entropy
has units of J/K and the temperature is measured in kelvins.
Change in Entropy
SQTThe change in entropy of an object is equal to the heat added to the object
divided by the temperature of the object in kelvins.323-331 CH12-S2-845813  6/3/04  3:09 PM  Page 329Figure 12-15

If no work is doneon a system, entropy spontaneously

330Chapter 12Thermal Energy
The second law of thermodynamics
states that natural processes go ina direction that maintains or increases the total entropy of the universe.
That is, all things will become more and more disordered unless some

action is taken to keep them ordered. The increase in entropy and the sec-

ond law of thermodynamics can be thought of as statements of the prob-

ability of events happening. 
Figure 12-15illustrates an increase in entropy
as food-coloring molecules, originally separate from the clear water, are

thoroughly mixed with the water molecules over time. 
Figure 12-16shows
an example of the second law of thermodynamics that might be familiar

to many teenagers.
The second law of thermodynamics predicts that heat flows sponta-
neously only from a hot object to a cold object. Consider a hot iron bar
and a cold cup of water. On the average, the particles in the iron will be

moving very fast, whereas the particles in the water will be moving slowly.

When the bar is plunged into the water and thermal equilibrium is even-

tually reached, the average kinetic energy of the particles in the iron and

the water will be the same. More particles now have an increased random

motion than was true for the initial state. This final state is less ordered

than the initial state. The fast particles are no longer confined solely to the

iron, and the slower particles are no longer confined only to the water; all

speeds are evenly distributed. The entropy of the final state is greater than

that of the initial state.
Violations of the second law
We take for granted many daily events that
occur spontaneously, or naturally, in one direction. We would be shocked,
however, if the reverse of the same events occurred spontaneously. You are

not surprised when a metal spoon, heated at one end, soon becomes 
uniformly hot. Consider your reaction, however, if a spoon lying on a table

suddenly, on its own, became red hot at one end and icy cold at the other.

If you dive into a swimming pool, you take for granted that you push the

water molecules away as you enter the water. However, you would be

amazed if you were swimming in the pool and all the water molecules

spontaneously threw you up onto the diving board. Neither of these 

imagined reverse processes would violate the first law of thermodynamics.

They are simply examples of the countless events that do not occur because

their processes would violate the second law of thermodynamics.

125.0 m12.2Section Review
physicspp.com/self_check_quizThe second law of thermodynamics and the increase in entropy also
give new meaning to what has been commonly called the 
energy crisis.
The energy crisis refers to the continued use of limited resources of fossil fuels, such as natural gas and petroleum. When you use a resource,

such as natural gas to heat your home, you do not use up the energy in 

the gas. As the gas ignites, the internal chemical energy contained 

in the molecules of the gas is converted into thermal energy of the flame. 

The thermal energy of the flame is then transferred to thermal energy 
in the air of your home. Even if this warm air leaks to the outside, the

energy is not lost. Energy has not been used up. The entropy, however, 

has increased. The chemical structure of natural gas is very ordered. As you have
learned, when a substance becomes warmer, the average kinetic energy of

the particles in the substance increases. In contrast, the random motion of

warmed air is very disordered. While it is mathematically possible for the

original chemical order to be reestablished, the probability of this occur-
ring is essentially zero. For this reason, entropy often is used as a measure

of the unavailability of useful energy. The energy in the warmed air in a

home is not as available to do mechanical work or to transfer heat to other

objects as the original gas molecules were. The lack of usable energy is

actually a surplus of entropy.

323-331 CH12-S2-845813  6/3/04  3:10 PM  Page 331332Heating and CoolingWhen a beaker of water is set on a hot plate and the hot plate is turned on, heat is
transferred. It first is transferred to the beaker and then to the water at the bottom

of the beaker by conduction. The water then transfers heat from the bottom to the

top by moving hot water to the top through convection. Once the heat source is

removed or shut off, the water radiates thermal energy until it reaches room tem-

perature. How quickly the water heats up is a function of the amount of heat

added, the mass of the water, and the specific heat of water.

¥The temperature of a gas is proportional to the average kinetic energy of 
its particles. 
¥Thermal energy is a measure of the internal motion of an objectÕs particles. 
¥A thermometer reaches thermal equilibrium with the object that it comes 
in contact with, and then a temperature-dependent property of the
thermometer indicates the temperature. 
¥The Celsius and Kelvin temperature scales are used in scientific work. The

magnitude of 1 K is equal to the magnitude of 1°C. ¥At absolute zero, no more thermal energy can be removed from a substance. 
¥Heat is energy transferred because of a difference in temperature. 
¥Specific heat is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg
of a substance by 1 K. 
¥In a closed, isolated system, heat may flow and change the thermal energy 

of parts of the system, but the total energy of the system is constant. 
EAEBconstantQmCTmC(TfTi)Key Concepts
¥The heat of fusion is the quantity of heat needed to change 1 kg of a
substance from its solid to liquid state at its melting point. ¥The heat of vaporization is the quantity of heat needed to change 1 kg of 

a substance from its liquid to gaseous state at its boiling point. ¥Heat transferred during a change of state does not change the temperature 
of a substance.
¥The change in energy of an object is the sum of the heat added to it minus
the work done by the object. 
¥A heat engine continuously converts thermal energy to mechanical energy. 
¥A heat pump and a refrigerator use mechanical energy to transfer heat from
a region of lower temperature to one of higher temperature.
¥Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. 
¥The change in entropy of an object is defined to be the heat added to the

object divided by the temperature of the object.

QuestionHow can you measure the buoyancy of objects?
Procedure
1.Obtain a small vial (with a cap or a seal) and
a 500-mL graduated cylinder. Attach a rubber

band to the vial in order to suspend it from 
a spring scale.
2.Use the spring scale to find the weight of the

vial. Then, use the graduated cylinder to find
the volume of water displaced by the sealed
vial when it is floating. Record both of these
figures. Immediately wipe up any spilled liquid.
3.Place one nickel into the vial and close the lid.
Repeat the procedures in step 2, recording

the weight of the vial and the nickel, as well
as the volume of water displaced. Also, record
whether the vial floats or sinks.
4.Repeat steps 2 and 3, each time adding one
nickel until the vial no longer floats. When the

vial sinks, use the spring scale to find the

apparent weight of the vial. Be sure that thevial is not touching the graduated cylinder

when it is suspended under water.

plasmaWater and air are probably two of the most common substances in
the everyday lives of people. We feel their effects when we drink,
when we bathe, and literally with every breath we take. In your everyday

experience, it might not seem that water and air have a great deal in com-

mon. If you think further about them, however, you will recognize that

they have common properties. Both water and air flow, and unlike solids,

neither one of them has a definite shape. Gases and liquids are two states

of matter in which atoms and molecules have great freedom to move.
In this chapter, you will explore states of matter. Beginning with gases
and liquids, you will learn about the principles that explain how matter

responds to changes in temperature and pressure, how hydraulic systems

can multiply forces, and how huge metallic ships can float on water. You

also will investigate the properties of solids, discovering how they expand

and contract, why some solids are elastic, and why some solids seem to

straddle the line between solid and liquid.

Suppose that you put an ice cube in an empty glass. The ice cube has a
certain mass and shape, and neither of these quantities depends on the size
or shape of the glass. What happens, however, when the ice melts? Its mass

remains the same, but its shape changes. The water flows to take the shape

of its container and forms a definite, flat, upper surface, as in 
Figure 13-1.If you boiled the water, it would change into a gas in the form of water vapor,

and it also would flow and expand to fill the room. However, the water

vapor would not have any definite surface. Both liquids and gases are 
fluids,
which are materials that flow and have no definite shape of their own. 

For now, you can assume that you are dealing with ideal fluids, whose 

particles take up no space and have no intermolecular attractive forces.
Pressure in fluids
You have applied the law of conservation of energy to
solid objects. Can this law also be applied to fluids? Work and energy can
be defined if we introduce the concept of 
pressure,
which is the force ona surface, divided by the area of the surface. Since pressure is force exerted

over a surface, anything that exerts pressure is capable of producing change

and doing work. 
Pressure (P) is a scalar quantity. In the SI system, the unit of pressure 
is the pascal(Pa), which is 1 N/m
2. Because the pascal is a small unit, the kilopascal (kPa), equal to 1000 Pa, is more commonly used. The force,

F, on a surface is assumed to be perpendicular to the surface area, A.Figure 13-2illustrates the relationships between force, area, and pressure.
Table 13-1
shows how pressures vary in different situations.
Solids, liquids, and pressure
Imagine that you are standing on the surface
of a frozen lake. The forces that your feet exert on the ice are spread over

the area of your shoes, resulting in pressure on the ice. Ice is a solid that is

made up of vibrating water molecules, and the forces that hold the water

molecules in place cause the ice to exert upward forces on your feet that

equal your weight. If 
the ice melted, most of the bonds between the water
molecules would be w
eakened. Although the molecules would continue to
vibrate and remain close to each other, they also would slide past one

another, and you would break through the surface. The moving water mol-

ecules would continue to exert forces on your body.
Gas particles and pressure
The pressure exerted by a gas can be under-
stood by applying the kinetic-molecular 
theory of gases. The kinetic-molecular theory explains the properties of an ideal gas. In reality, the 
particles of a gas take up space and have intermolecular attractive forces, but

an ideal gas is an accurate model of a real gas under most conditions.

According to the kinetic-molecular the
ory, the particles in a gas are in 
random motion at high speeds and undergoing elastic collisions with eachother. When a gas particle hits a con
tainerÕs surface
, it rebounds, which
changes its momentum. The impulses exerted by many of these collisions

result in gas pressure on the surface.
PressurePAFPressure equals force divided by surface area.

On every square cen-
timeter of EarthÕs surface at sea level, the
atmospheric gas exerts a force of approximately
10 N, about the weight of a 1-kg object. The

pressure of EarthÕs atmosphere on your body is

so well balanced by your bodyÕs outward forces

that you seldom notice it. You probably

become aware of this pressure only when your

ears pop as the result of pressure changes, as

when you ride an elevator in a tall building 

or fly in an airplane. Atmospheric pressure 

is about 10 N per 1 cm
2(10
4m2), which isabout 1.0105N/m2, or 100 kPa. Other plan-
ets in our solar system also have atmospheres. The pressure exerted by

these atmospheres, however, varies widely. For example, the pressure at the 

surface of Venus is about 92 times the pressure at the surface of Earth,

while the pressure at the surface of Mars is less than 1 percent of EarthÕs.

As scientists first studied gases and pressure, they began to notice some
interesting relationships. The first relationship to emerge was named
BoyleÕs law, after seventeenth-century chemist and physicist Robert Boyle.

BoyleÕs law states that for a fixed sample of gas at constant temperature, 

the volume of the gas varies inversely with the pressure. Because the 

product of inversely related variables is a constant, BoyleÕs law can be 

written PVconstant, or P1V1P2V2. The subscripts that you see in the
gas laws will help you keep track of different variables, such as pressure

and volume, as they change throughout a problem. These variables can 

be rearranged to solve for an unknown pressure or volume. As shown in

Figure 13-3,the relationship between the pressure and the volume of a
gas is critical to the sport of scuba diving.A second relationship was discovered about 100 years after BoyleÕs work
by Jacques Charles. When Charles cooled a gas, the volume shrank by 
2173of its original volume for every degree cooled, which is a linear relationship.

At the time, Charles could not cool gases to the extremely low tempera-

tures achieved in modern laboratories. In order to see what lower limits

might be possible, he extended, or extrapolated, the graph of his data to

these temperatures. This extrapolation suggested that if the temperature

were reduced to 
273°C, a gas would have zero volume. The temperature
at which a gas would have zero volume is now called absolute zero, which

is represented by the zero of the Kelvin temperature scale.
These experiments indicated that under constant pressure, the volume
of a sample of gas varies directly with its Kelvin temperature, a result that

is now called CharlesÕs law. CharlesÕs law can be written 
V/Tconstant, or V1/T1V2/T2.Figure 13-3
The gas in the 
tank on the diverÕs back is at high
pressure. This pressure is reduced

340-348 CH13-S1-845813  3/30/04  3:06 AM  Page 344Combining BoyleÕs law and CharlesÕs law relates the pressure, tempera-
ture, and volume of a fixed amount of ideal gas, which leads to the equation
called the combined gas law.
As shown in 
Figure 13-4, the combined gas law reduces to BoyleÕs law
under conditions of constant temperature and to CharlesÕs law under con-

ditions of constant pressure.
The ideal gas law
You can use the kinetic-molecular theory to discover
how the constant in the combined gas law depends on the number of par-
ticles, 
N. Suppose that the volume and temperature of an ideal gas are held
constant. If the number of particles increases, the number of collisions that

the particles make with the container will increase, thereby increasing the

pressure. Removing particles decreases the number of collisions, and thus,

decreases the pressure. You can conclude that the constant in the com-

bined gas law equation is proportional to 
N. PTVkNThe constant, k, is called BoltzmannÕs constant, and its value is
1.381023Pam3/K. Of course, 
N, the number of particles, is a very large
number. Instead of using 
N, scientists often use a unit called a mole. One
mole (abbreviated mol and represented in equations by 
n) is similar toone dozen, except that instead of representing 12 items, one mole repre-

sents 6.022
1023particles. This number is called AvogadroÕs number, after
Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro.
AvogadroÕs number is numerically equal to the number of particles in 
a sample of matter whose mass equals the molar mass of the substance.

You can use this relationship to convert

between mass and 
n, the number of moles pres-ent. Using moles instead of the number of par-

ticles changes BoltzmannÕs constant. This new

constant is abbreviated R, and it has the value
8.31 Pa
m3/molK. Rearranging, you can write
the ideal gas law
in its most familiar form.Note that with the given value of 
R, volume
must be expressed in m3, temperature in K, andpressure in Pa. In practice, the ideal gas law pre-
dicts the behavior of gases remarkably well,

except under conditions of high pressures or
low temperatures.

diatomic nitrogen gas) is about 29 g/mol. What is the volume of 1.0 kg of air at

atmospheric pressure and 20.0
°C? Thermal ExpansionAs you applied the combined gas law, you discovered how gases expand
as their temperatures increase. When heated, all forms of matterÑsolids,
liquids, and gasesÑgenerally become less dense and expand to fill more

space. This property, known as 
thermal expansion,has many useful
applications, such as circulating air in a room. When the air near the floor

of a room is warmed, gravity pulls the denser, colder air near the ceiling

down, which pushes the warmer air upward. This circulation of air within

a room is called a convection current. 
Figure 13-5shows convection 
currents starting as the hot air above the flames rises. You also can see 

convection currents in a pot of hot, but not boiling, water on a stove.

When the pot is heated from the bottom, the colder and denser water sinks

to the bottom where it is warmed and then pushed up by the continuous

flow of cooler water from the top.
This thermal expansion occurs in most liquids. A good model for all liq-
uids does not exist, but it is useful to think of a liquid as a finely ground
solid. Groups of two, three, or more particles move together as if they were

tiny pieces of a solid. When a liquid is heated, particle motion causes these

groups to expand in the same way that particles in a solid are pushed apart.

The spaces between groups increase. As a result, the whole liquid expands.

With an equal change in temperature, liquids expand considerably more

than solids, but not as much as gases.
Why ice floats
Because matter expands as it is heated, you might predict
that ice would be more dense than water, and therefore, it should sink.
However, when water is heated from 0
°C to 4°C, instead of expanding, itcontracts as the forces between particles increase and the ice crystals col-

lapse. These forces between water molecules are strong, and the crystals

that make up ice have a very open structure. Even when ice melts, tiny crys-

tals remain. These remaining crystals are melting, and the volume of the

water decreases until the temperature reaches 4
°C. However, once the tem-
perature of water moves above 4
°C, its volume increases because of greater
molecular motion. The practical result is that water is most dense at 4
°Cand ice floats. This fact is very important to our lives and environment. If

ice sank, lakes would freeze from the bottom each winter and many would

never melt completely in the summer.

Figure 13-6
The colorful lighting
effects in neon signs are caused
by luminous plasmas formed inthe glass tubing.Plasma
If you heat a solid, it melts to form a liquid. Further heating results in a
gas. What happens if you increase the temperature still further? Collisions

between the particles become violent enough to tear the electrons off the

atoms, thereby producing positively charged ions. The gaslike state of neg-

atively charged electrons and positively charged ions is called 
plasma.Plasma is considered to be another fluid state of matter.
The plasma state may seem to be uncommon; however, most of the mat-
ter in the universe is plasma. Stars consist mostly of plasma at extremely

high temperatures. Much of the matter between stars and galaxies consists

of energetic hydrogen that has no electrons. This hydrogen is in the plasma

state. The primary difference between gas and plasma is that plasma can

conduct electricity, whereas gas cannot. Lightning bolts are in the plasma

state. Neon signs, such as the one shown in 
Figure 13-6,fluorescent bulbs,
and sodium vapor lamps all contain glowing plasma.
Norman Tomalin/Bruce Coleman
340-348 CH13-S1-845813  3/30/04  3:08 AM  Page 348The liquids considered thus far have been ideal liquids, in which the
particles are totally free to slide past one another. The unexpected
behavior of water between 0
°C and 4°C, however, illustrates that in 
real fluids, particles exert electromagnetic forces of attraction, called 

cohesive forces,
on each other. These and other forces affect the behavior
of fluids.
Cohesive Forces
Have you ever noticed that dewdrops on spiderwebs and falling drops
of oil are nearly spherical? What happens when rain falls on a freshly
washed and waxed car? The water drops bead up into rounded shapes, 

as shown in the spiderweb in 
Figure 13-7.All of these phenomena areexamples of surface tension,which is the tendency of the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible area. Surface tension is a result
of the cohesive forces among the particles of a liquid.
Notice that beneath the surface of the liquid shown in 
Figure 13-8aonthe next page, each particle of the liquid is attracted equally in all direc-

tions by neighboring particles, and even to the particles of the wall of 

the container. As a result, no net force acts on any of the particles beneath

the surface. At the surface, however, the particles are attracted downward

and to the sides, but not upward. There is a net downward force, which acts

on the top layers and causes the surface layer to be slightly compressed.

The surface layer acts like a tightly stretched rubber sheet or a film that is

strong enough to support the weight of very light objects, such as the water

strider in Figure 13-8bon the next page. The surface tension of water also
can support a steel paper clip, even though the density of steel is nine

times greater than that of water. Try it!
Why does surface tension produce spherical drops? The force pulling
the surface particles into a liquid causes the surface to become as small as
possible, and the shape that has the least surface for a given volume is a

sphere. The higher the surface tension of the liquid, the more resistant 

the liquid is to having its surface broken. For example, liquid mercury 

has much stronger cohesive forces than water does. Thus, liquid mercury

forms spherical drops, even when it is placed on a smooth surface. On the

other hand, liquids such as alcohol and ether have weaker cohesive forces. 

A drop of either of these liquids flattens out on a smooth surface.
Viscosity
In nonideal fluids, the cohesive forces and collisions between
fluid molecules cause internal friction that slows the fluid flow and 
dissipates mechanical energy. The measure of this internal friction is 

called the viscosity of the liquid. Water is not very viscous, but motor oil 

is very viscous. As a result of its viscosity, motor oil flows slowly over 

the parts of an engine to coat the metal and reduce rubbing. Lava, molten

rock that flows from a volcano or vent in EarthÕs surface, is one of the most

viscous fluids. There are several types of lava, and the viscosity of each 

type varies with composition and temperature.

Figure 13-8
Molecules in the
interior of a liquid are attracted in all directions (a).A waterstrider can walk on water because

molecules at the surface have a

net inward attraction that results
in surface tension 
(b).Figure 13-9
Water climbs the
outside wall of this glass tube 
(a),while the mercury is depressed 
by the rod (b).The forces of
attraction between mercury atoms
are stronger than any adhesive 

forces between the mercury 

and the glass.ababAdhesive Forces
Similar to cohesive forces, 
adhesive forces
are electromagnetic attractive
forces that act between particles of different substances. If a glass tube with
a small inner diameter is placed in water, the water rises inside the tube. The

water rises because the adhesive forces between glass and water molecules

are stronger than the cohesive forces between water molecules. This phe-

nomenon is called capillary action. The water continues to rise until the

weight of the water that is lifted balances the total adhesive force between

the glass and water molecules. If the radius of the tube increases, the vol-

ume and the weight of the water will increase proportionally faster than the

surface area of the tube. Thus, water is lifted higher in a narrow tube than

in a wider one. Capillary action causes molten wax to rise in a candleÕs

wick and water to move up through the soil and into the roots of plants.
When a glass tube is placed in a beaker of water, the surface of the water
climbs the outside of the tube, as shown in 
Figure 13-9a.The adhesive
forces between the glass molecules and water molecules are greater than

the cohesive forces between the water molecules. In contrast, the cohesive

forces between mercury molecules are greater than the adhesive forces

between the mercury and glass molecules, so the liquid does not climb the

tube. These forces also cause the center of the mercuryÕs surface to depress,

as shown in 
Figure 13-9b.
Evaporation and Condensation
Why does a puddle of water disappear on a hot, dry day? As you learned
in Chapter 12, the particles in a liquid are moving at 
random speeds. 
If afast-moving particle can break through the surface layer, it will escape from

the liquid. Because there is a net downward cohesive force at the surface,

however, only the most energetic particles escape. This escape of particles

is called evaporation.
PlantsCohesive forces in
liquids actually allow them to bestretched just like rubber bands.
This stretching is difficult to

achieve in the laboratory, but it is

common in plants. The strength of

the cohesive forces in water keeps

the water from breaking and
bubbling as it goes through the

Evaporation has a cooling effect. On a hot day, your
body perspires, and the evaporation of your sweat cools you down. In a
puddle of water, evaporation causes the remaining liquid to cool down.

Each time a particle with higher-than-average kinetic energy escapes from

the water, the average kinetic energy of the remaining particles decreases.

As you learned in Chapter 12, a decrease in average kinetic energy is a

decrease in temperature. You can test this cooling effect by pouring a small

amount of rubbing alcohol in the palm of your hand. Alcohol molecules

evaporate easily because they have weak cohesive forces. As the molecules

evaporate, the cooling effect is quite noticeable. A liquid that evaporates

quickly is called a volatile liquid.
Have you ever wondered why humid days feel warmer than dry days at 
the same temperature? On a day that is humid, the water vapor content of 
the air is high. Because there are already many water molecules in the air, the

water molecules in perspiration are less likely to evaporate from the skin.

Evaporation is the bodyÕs primary cooling mechanism, so the body is not

able to cool itself as effectively on a humid day.
Particles of liquid that have evaporated into the air can also return to the
liquid phase if the kinetic energy or temperature decreases, a process called

condensation. What happens if you bring a cold glass into a hot, humid

area? The outside of the glass soon becomes coated with condensed water.

Water molecules moving randomly in the air surrounding the glass strike

the cold surface, and if they lose enough energy, the cohesive forces

become strong enough to prevent their escape.
The air above any body of water, as shown in 
Figure 13-10,
containsevaporated water vapor, which is water in the form of gas. If the temperature

is reduced, the water vapor condenses around tiny dust particles in the air

and produces droplets only 0.01 mm in diameter. A cloud of these droplets

is called fog. Fog often forms when moist air is chilled by the cold ground.

Fog also can form in your home. When a carbonated drink is opened, the

sudden decrease in pressure causes the temperature of the gas in the 
container to drop, which condenses the water vapor dissolved in that gas.

Orville Andrews349-351 CH13-S2-845813  6/3/04  3:40 PM  Page 351You have learned how fluids exert pressure, the force per unit area. You
also know that the pressure exerted by fluids changes; for example,
atmospheric pressure drops as you climb a mountain. In this section, you

will learn about the forces exerted by resting and moving fluids.
Fluids at Rest
If you have ever dived deep into a swimming pool or lake, you know
that your body, especially your ears, is sensitive to changes in pressure. You

may have noticed that the pressure you felt on your ears did not depend

on whether your head was upright or tilted, but that if you swam deeper,

the pressure increased.PascalÕs principle
Blaise Pascal, a French physician, noted that the 
pressure in a fluid depends upon the depth of the fluid and has nothing todo with the shape of the fluidÕs container. He also discovered that any

change in pressure applied at any point on a confined fluid is transmitted

undiminished throughout the fluid, a fact that is now known as 
PascalÕs
principle.
Every time you squeeze a tube of toothpaste, you demonstrate
PascalÕs principle. The pressure that your fingers exert at the bottom of 

the tube is transmitted through the toothpaste and forces the paste out at
the top. Likewise, if you squeeze one end of a helium balloon, the other

end of the balloon expands.
When fluids are used in machines to multiply forces, PascalÕs principle is
being applied. In a common hydraulic system, a fluid is confined to two

connecting chambers, as shown in 
Figure 13-11.
Each chamber has a piston that is free to move, and the pistons have different surface areas. If a

force, 
F1, is exerted on the first piston with a surface area of A1, the pressure,
P1, exerted on the fluid can be determined by using the following equation.
P1AF11This equation is simply the definition of pressure: pressure equals the force
per unit area. The pressure exerted by the fluid on the second piston, with

a surface area A2, can also be determined.P2AF22According to PascalÕs principle, pressure is transmitted without change

throughout a fluid, so pressure P2is equal in value to 
P1. You can deter-
mine the force exerted by the second piston by using 
F1/A1F2/A2andsolving for F2. This force is shown by the following equation.
Force Exerted by a Hydraulic Lift
F2FA1A12The force exerted by the second piston is equal to the force exerted by the
first piston multiplied by the ratio of the area of the second piston to the area
of the first piston.352Chapter 13States of Matter

Swimming Under Pressure
When you are swimming, you feel the pressure of the water increase as
you dive deeper. This pressure is actually a result of gravity; it is related to
the weight of the water above you. The deeper you go, the more water there

is above you, and the greater the pressure. The pressure of the water is

equal to the weight, 
Fg, of the column of water above you divided by the
columnÕs cross-sectional area, 
A. Even though gravity pulls only in the
downward direction, the fluid transmits the pressure in all directions: up,

down, and to the sides. You can find the pressure of the water by applying

the following equation.
PFAgThe weight of the column of water is 
Fgmg, and the mass is equal tothe density, 
, of the water times its volume, 
mV. You also know that the
volume of the water is the area of the base of the column times its height,

VAh. Therefore, 
FgAhg. Substituting Ahgfor Fgin the equation forwater pressure gives 
PFg/AAhg/A. Divide Afrom the numerator anddenominator to arrive at the simplest form of the equation for the pressure

exerted by a column of water on a submerged body.
This formula works for all fluids, not just water. The pressure of a fluid
on a body depends on the density of the fluid, its depth, and g. If therewere water on the Moon, the pressure of the water at any depth would be

one-sixth as great as on Earth. As illustrated in Figure 13-12,submersibles,
both crewed and robotic, have explored the deepest ocean trenches and

encountered pressures in excess of 1000 times standard air pressure.
Pressure of Water on a Body
PhgThe pressure that a column of water exerts on a body is equal to the density
of water times the height of the column times the acceleration due to gravity.

What produces the upward force that allows
you to swim? The increase in pressure with increasing
depth creates an upward force called the 
buoyant force.
By comparing the buoyant force on an object with its

weight, you can predict whether the object will sink or float.
Suppose that a box is immersed in water. It has a
height of land its top and bottom each have a surface
area of A. Its volume, then, is 
VlA. Water pressure
exerts forces on all sides, as shown in 
Figure 13-13.Willthe box sink or float? As you know, the pressure on the

box depends on its depth, h. To find out whether the box
will float in water, you will need to determine how the

pressure on the top of the box compares with the pressure
from below the box. Compare these two equations:
FtopPtop AhgAFbottomPbottom A(lh)gAOn the four vertical sides, the forces are equal in all directions, so there
is no net horizontal force. The upward force on the bottom is larger than

the downward force on the top, so there is a net upward force. The buoy-

ant force can now be determined.
Fbuoyant
FbottomFtop(lh)gAhgAlgAVgThese calculations show the net upward force to be proportional to the

volume of the box. This volume equals the volume of the fluid displaced,

or pushed out of the way, by the box. Therefore, the magnitude of the

buoyant force, 
Vg, equals the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
This relationship was discovered in the third century 
B.C.by Greek sci-
entist Archimedes. 
ArchimedesÕ principlestates that an object immersedin a fluid has an upward force on it that is equal to the weight of the fluid 

displaced by the object. The force does not depend on the weight of the

object, only on the weight of the displaced fluid.
Sink or float?If you want to know whether an object sinks or floats, you
have to take into account all of the forces acting on the object. The buoyant
force pushes up, but the weight of the object pulls it down. The difference

between the buoyant force and the objectÕs weight determines whether an

object sinks or floats.
Suppose that you submerge three objects in a tank filled with water 
(water
1.00103kg/m3). Each of the objects has a volume of 100 cm
3,or 1.00104m3. The first object is a steel block with a mass of 0.90 kg.
Buoyant Force

fluidVgThe buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced

A fluid exerts a
greater upward force on thebottom of an immersed object
than the downward force on the
top of the object. The net upward
force is called the buoyant force.

an ice cube with a mass of 0.090 kg. How will each item move when it is

immersed in water? The upward force on all three objects, as shown in

Figure 13-14,is the same, because all displace the same weight of water.
This buoyant force can be calculated as follows.
Fbuoyant
water
Vg(1.00103kg/m3)(1.00104m3)(9.80 m/s2)0.980 NThe weight of the block of steel is 8.8 N, much greater than the buoyant
force. There is a net downward force, so the block will sink to the bottom

of the tank. The net downward force, its apparent weight, is less than its

real weight. All objects in a liquid, even those that sink, have an apparent

weight that is less than when the object is in air. The apparent weight can

be expressed by the equation 
FapparentFgFbuoyant
. For the block of
steel, the apparent weight is 8.8 N
0.98 N, or 7.8 N.The weight of the soda can is 0.98 N, the same as the weight of the water
displaced. There is, therefore, no net force, and the can will remain wher-

ever it is placed in the water. It has neutral buoyancy. Objects with neutral

buoyancy are described as being weightless; their apparent weight is zero.

This property is similar to that experienced by astronauts in orbit, which is

why astronaut training sometimes takes place in swimming pools.
The weight of the ice cube is 0.88 N, less than the buoyant force, so there
is a net upward force, and the ice cube will rise. At the surface, the net

upward force will lift part of the ice cube out of the water. As a result, less

water will be displaced, and the upward force will be reduced. The ice cube

will float with enough volume in the water so that the weight of water dis-

placed equals the weight of the ice cube. An object will float if its density

is less than the density of the fluid in which it is immersed.ShipsArchimedesÕ principle explains why ships can be made of steel and
still float; if the hull is hollow and large enough so that the average den-
sity of the ship is less than the density of water, the ship will float. You may

have noticed that a ship loaded with cargo rides lower in the water than a

ship with an empty cargo hold. You can demonstrate this effect by fash-

ioning a small boat out of folded aluminum foil. The boat should float
easily, and it will ride lower in the water if you add a cargo of paper clips.

If the foil is crumpled into a tight ball, the boat will sink because of its
increased density. Similarly, the continents of Earth float upon a denser

material below the surface. The drifting motion of these continental plates

is responsible for the present shapes and locations of the continents.
Other examples of ArchimedesÕ principle in action include submarinesand fishes. Submarines take advantage of ArchimedesÕ principle as water 

is pumped into or out of a number of different chambers to change the
submarineÕs average density, causing it to rise or sink. Fishes that have

swim bladders also use 
ArchimedesÕ principle to control their depths. Such
a fish can expand or contract its swim bladder, just like you can puff up
your cheeks. To move upward in the water, the fish expands its swim blad-

der to displace more water and increase the buoyant force. The fish moves

downward by contracting the volume of its swim bladder.

Try the experiment shown in 
Figure 13-15.Hold a strip of notebookpaper just under your lower lip. Then blow hard across the top surface. Why
does the strip of paper rise? The blowing of the air has decreased the air

pressure above the paper. Because this pressure decreases, the pressure in the

still air below the paper pushes the paper upward. The relationship between

the velocity and pressure exerted by a moving fluid is named for Swiss 

scientist Daniel Bernoulli. BernoulliÕs principle
states that as the velocity
of a fluid increases, the pressure exerted by that fluid decreases. This prin-

ciple is a statement of work and energy conservation as applied to fluids.
One instance in which fluid velocity can increase is when it flows
through a constriction. The nozzles on some garden hoses can be opened
or narrowed so that the velocity of the water spray can be changed. You

may have seen the water in a stream speed up as it passed through nar-

rowed sections of the stream bed. As the nozzle of the hose and the stream

channel become wider or narrower, the velocity of the fluid changes to

maintain the overall flow of water. In addition to streams and hoses, the

pressure of blood in our circulatory systems depends partly on BernoulliÕs

principle. Treatments of heart disease involve removing obstructions in the

arteries and veins and preventing clots in the blood.
Consider a horizontal pipe completely filled with a smoothly flowing
ideal fluid. If a certain mass of the fluid enters one end of the pipe, then an

equal mass must come out the other end. Now consider a section of pipe

with a cross section that becomes narrower, as shown in 
Figure 13-16a.Tokeep the same mass of fluid moving through the narrow section in a fixed

amount of time, the velocity of the fluid must increase. As the fluidÕs veloc-

ity increases, so does its kinetic energy. This means that net work has been

done on the swifter fluid. This net work comes from the difference

between the work that was done to move the mass of fluid into the pipe

and the work that was done by the fluid pushing the same mass out of the

pipe. The work is proportional to the force on the fluid, which, in turn,

depends on the pressure. If the net work is positive, the pressure at the

input end of the section, where the velocity is lower, must be larger than

the pressure at the output end, where the velocity is higher.
Applications of BernoulliÕs principleThere are many common applica-
tions of BernoulliÕs principle, such as paint sprayers and perfume bottles.
The simple atomizer on a perfume bottle works by blowing air across the

top of a tube sunk into perfume, which creates lower pressure at the top of

the tube than in the bottle. As a result, perfume is forced into the air flow.

A gasoline engineÕs carburetor, which is where air and gas are mixed, is

another common application of BernoulliÕs principle. Part of the carburetor

is a tube with a constriction, as shown in the diagram in 
Figure 13-16b.
The pressure on the gasoline in the fuel supply is the same as the pressure
in the thicker part of the tube. Air 
flowing 
through the narrow section of the
tube, which is attached to the 
fuel supply, 
is at a lower pressure, so fuel is
forced into the air flow. By regulating the flow of air in the tube, the amount

of fuel mixed into the air can be varied. Newer cars tend to have fuel injec-

tors rather than carburetors, but carburetors are common in older cars and

the motors of small gasoline-powered machines, such as lawn mowers.

Streamlines can best be illustrated by a simple demonstration. Imagine
carefully squeezing tiny drops of food coloring into a smoothly flowing

fluid. If the colored lines that form stay thin and well defined, the flow is

said to be streamlined. Notice that if the flow narrows, the streamlines

move closer together. Closely spaced streamlines indicate greater velocity

and therefore reduced pressure. If streamlines swirl and become diffused,

the flow of the fluid is said to be turbulent. BernoulliÕs principle does not

apply to turbulent flow.

it to be worked in a fashion 
similar to everyday glass (b).baSection 13.4Solids
359How do solids and liquids differ? Solids are stiff, they can be cut in
pieces, and they retain their shapes. You can push on solids. Liquids
flow and if you push your finger on water, your finger will move through

it. However, if you have ever watched butter warm and begin to lose its

shape, you may have wondered if the line between solids and liquids is

always distinct.
Solid Bodies
Under certain conditions, solids and liquids are not easily distin-
guished. As bottle glass is heated through the molten state, the change

from solid to liquid is so gradual that it is difficult to tell which is which.
Some solids, such as crystalline quartz, are made of particles that are lined

up in orderly patterns. Other solids, such as glass, are made of jumbled

arrangements of particles, just like a liquid. As shown in 
Figure 13-18,quartz and fused quartz (also called quartz glass) are the same chemically,

but their physical properties are quite different.
When the temperature of a liquid is lowered, the average kinetic energy
of the particles decreases. As the particles slow down, the cohesive forces

have more effect, and for many solids, the particles become frozen into a

fixed pattern called a crystal lattice,
shown in 
Figure 13-19on the nextpage. Although the cohesive forces hold the particles in place, the particles

in a crystalline solid do not stop moving completely. Rather, they vibrate

around their fixed positions. In other materials, such as butter and glass,

the particles do not form a fixed crystalline pattern. Such a substance,

which has no regular crystal structure but does have a definite volume and

shape, is called an 
amorphous solid.Amorphous solids also are classifiedas viscous, or slowly flowing, liquids.
Pressure and freezing
As a liquid becomes a solid, its particles usually fitmore closely together than in the liquid state, making solids more dense
than liquids. As you have learned, however, water is an exception because

it is most dense at 4°C. Water is also an exception to another general rule.
For most liquids, an increase in the pressure on the surface of the liquid

increases its freezing point. Because water expands as it freezes, an increase

in pressure forces the molecules closer together and opposes the freezing.
Therefore, higher pressure lowers the freezing point of water very slightly.

359-363 CH13-S4-845813  4/2/04  6:30 PM  Page 359It has been hypothesized that the drop in waterÕs freezing point caused
by the pressure of an ice-skaterÕs blades produces a thin film of liquid
between the ice and the blades. Calculations of the pressure caused by even

the sharpest blade show that the ice is still too cold to melt. More recent

measurements, however, have shown that the friction between the blade

and the ice generates enough thermal energy to melt the ice and create a
thin layer of water. This explanation is supported by measurements of 

the spray of ice particles, which are considerably warmer than the ice itself.

The same process of melting occurs during snow skiing.
Elasticity of solidsExternal forces applied to a solid object may twist or
bend it out of shape. The ability of a solid object to return to its original
form when the external forces are removed is called the elasticity of the

solid. If too much deformation occurs, the object will not return to its orig-

inal shape because its elastic limit has been exceeded. Elasticity depends
on the electromagnetic forces that hold the particles of a substance
together. Malleability and ductility are two properties that depend on the

structure and elasticity of a substance. Because gold can be flattened and

shaped into thin sheets, it is said to be malleable. Copper is a ductile metal

because it can be pulled into thin strands of wire.
Thermal Expansion of SolidsIt is standard practice for engineers to design small gaps, called expan-
sion joints, into concrete-and-steel highway bridges to allow for the 

expansion of parts in the heat of summer. Objects expand only a small

amount when they are heated, but that small amount could be several cen-

timeters in a 100-m-long bridge. If expansion gaps were not present, the

bridge could buckle or parts of it could break. High temperatures can also
damage railroad tracks that are laid without expansion joints, as shown in

Figure 13-20. 
Some materials, such as the ovenproof glass that is used for
cooking and laboratory experiments, are designed to have the least possi-

ble thermal expansion. Large telescope mirrors are made of a ceramic
material that is designed to undergo essentially no thermal expansion.To understand the expansion of heated solids, picture a solid as a col-
lection of particles connected by springs that represent the attractive forces

between the particles. When the particles get too close, the springs push

them apart. When a solid is heated, the kinetic energy of the particles
increases, and they vibrate rapidly and move farther apart, weakening the

vibrate more violently with increased temperature, their average separation

increases and the solid expands.
The change in length of a solid is proportional to the change in tem-perature, as shown in 
Figure 13-21.
A solid will expand in length twice asmuch when its temperature is increased by 20
°C than when it is increasedby 10
°C. The expansion also is proportional to its length. A 2-m bar willexpand twice as much as a 1-m bar with the same change in temperature.

ing equation, where L1is the length at temperature T1and alpha, , is thecoefficient of linear expansion.L2L1L1(T2T1)Using simple algebra, you can solve for 
.L2L1L1(T2T1)LL1TThe unit for the coefficient of linear expansion is 1/°C, or (°C)1. Sincesolids expand in three directions, the 
coefficient of volume expansion,

Figure 13-23
You need to make a 1.00-m-long bar that expands with
temperature in the same way as a 1.00-m-long bar of copper

would. As shown in the figure at the right, your bar must be
made from a bar of iron and a bar of aluminum attached end to

end. How long should each of them be?LironLaluminumApplications of thermal expansionDifferent materials expand at differ-ent rates, as indicated by the different coefficients of expansion given in
Table 13-2. Engineers must consider these different expansion rates when

designing structures. Steel bars are often used to reinforce concrete, and

therefore the steel and concrete must have the same expansion coefficient.

Otherwise, the structure could crack on a hot day. Similarly, a dentist 

must use filling materials that expand and contract at the same rate as
tooth enamel.Different rates of expansion have useful applications. For example, engi-
neers have taken advantage of these differences to construct a useful device

called a bimetallic strip, which is used in thermostats. A bimetallic strip

consists of two strips of different metals welded or riveted together.

Usually, one strip is brass and the other is iron. When heated, brass

expands more than iron does. Thus, when the bimetallic strip of brass and

iron is heated, the brass part of the strip becomes longer than the iron part.
The bimetallic strip bends with the brass on the outside of the curve. If the

bimetallic strip is cooled, it bends in the opposite direction. The brass is
then on the inside of the curve.
In a home thermostat, shown in 
Figure 13-22,the bimetallic strip isinstalled so that it bends toward an electric contact as the room cools.

When the room cools below the setting on the thermostat, the bimetallic

strip bends enough to make electric contact with the switch, which turns
on the heater. As the room warms, the bimetallic strip bends in the other

direction. When the roomÕs temperature reaches the setting on the ther-

mostat, the electric circuit is broken and the heater switches off.Doug Martin359-363 CH13-S4-845813  6/4/04  9:04 AM  Page 363364Alternate CBL instructions

You now are familiar with
the four mostcommon states of matter: solid, liquid, gas,
and plasma. But did you know that there is a

fifth state of matter? Meet the Bose-Einstein
Condensate (BEC).What is a Bose-Einstein Condensate?The origins of the BEC are in the 1920s in

Satyendra Nath BoseÕs studies of the quantum

rules governing photon energies. Einstein

applied BoseÕs equations to 
atoms. The equa-
tions showed that if the temperature of certain

atoms were low enough, most of the atoms

would be in the same quantum level. In other

words, at extremely low temperatures, atoms

that had occupied different energy states sud-
denly fall into the lowest possible energy state.

At these temperatures, which are not found 

in nature, but are created in the lab through

some ingenious technology, the atoms of a

BEC cannot be distinguished. Even

their positions are identical.How is a BEC created?
The first BEC was created 

in 1995 by Eric Cornell and

Carl Wieman of Boulder,

Colorado. To make their BEC,

Cornell and Wieman used rubid-
ium atoms. They had to figure 

out how to cool these atoms to 

a lower temperature than had ever 

been achieved.
You might be surprised to learn that one
important step in reaching the necessary
temperatures was to use lasers to cool 

the rubidium atoms. 
Lasers can burn throughmetal, but they also can cool a sample of
atoms if they are tuned so that their photons
bounce off the atoms. In this case, the photons

will carry off some of the atomsÕ energy, lower-

ing the temperature of the sample. But the

laser will not cool the sample unless it is 
precisely tuned.When the laser is tuned to the proper fre-quency, the result is a sample of very cold

atoms known as Òoptical molasses.Ó How can

the optical molasses be contained? Thermal
contact between the optical molasses and a
material container surely would warm the

chilled atoms because any container would

have a higher temperature than the atoms. 

So the container of choice for the BEC is a
nonmaterial oneÑa container formed by 

combining lasers with a magnetic field.While optical molasses is cold (about1/10,000 K), it is not cold enough to form 

a BEC. Scientists use evaporative cooling to

make the final step to the required tempera-
tures. In evaporative cooling, the optical

molasses is contained in a stronger magnetic
container that allows the highest energy atoms

to escape. The atoms with the lowest possible

energy are left behind. These are the atoms 
that suddenly condense to form a BEC. The
images below show the final cooling of a sam-

ple of atoms to form a BEC (the central lump)
at fifty-billionths of a kelvin.1.Evaluate
What sorts of difficulties
might scientists have to overcome in
finding applications for the BEC?
2.Compare and Contrast
Is the evapo-rative cooling process that creates the

BEC the same process that helps keep

you cool on a hot day? Explain.Going Further
In these three images, the central peak
forms as atoms condense to a BEC.

YouÕve probably seen a clock pendulum swing back and forth. You

would have noticed that every swing followed the same path, and
each trip back and forth took the same amount of time. This action is an
example of 
vibrational motion. Other examples include a metal block bob-bing up and down on a spring and a vibrating guitar string. These motions,

which all repeat in a regular cycle, are examples of 
periodic motion.In each example, the object has one position at which the net force on
it is zero. At that position, the object is in equilibrium. Whenever the

object is pulled away from its equilibrium position, the net force on 

the system becomes nonzero and pulls the object back toward equilib-

rium. If the force that restores the object to its equilibrium position is
directly proportional to the displacement of the object, the motion that
results is called simple harmonic motion.Two quantities describe simple harmonic motion. The 
period,T, is thetime needed for an object to repeat one complete cycle of the motion, and

the amplitudeof the motion is the maximum distance that the objectmoves from equilibrium.

375Horizons Companies 374-380 CH14-S1-845813  6/4/04  8:53 AM  Page 375The Mass on a Spring
How does a spring react to a force that is applied
to it? Figure 14-1ashows a spring hanging from a
support with nothing attached to it. The springdoes not stretch because no external force is
exerted on it. Figure 14-1bshows the same spring
with an object of weight 
mghanging from it. Thespring has stretched by distance 
xso that theupward force it exerts balances the downward force

of gravity acting on the object. 
Figure 14-1cshows
the same spring stretched twice as far, 2
x, to supporttwice the weight, 2
mg, hanging from it. HookeÕs
law
states that the force exerted by a spring is
directly proportional to the amount that the springis stretched. A spring that acts in this way is said to obey HookeÕs law,

which can be expressed by the following equation. 
In this equation, kis the spring constant, which depends on the stiffnessand other properties of the spring, and xis the distance that the spring isstretched from its equilibrium position. Not all springs obey HookeÕs law,
but many do. Those that do are called elastic.
Potential energy
When a force is applied to stretch a spring, such as by
hanging an object on its end, there is a direct linear relationship between
the exerted force and the displacement, as shown by the graph in 
Figure14-2.The slope of the graph is equal to the spring constant, given in units
of newtons per meter. The area under the curve represents the work done

to stretch the spring, and therefore equals the elastic potential energy that
is stored in the spring as a result of that work. The base of the triangle is 
x,and the height is the force, which, according to the equation for HookeÕs

law, is equal to 
kx, so the potential energy in the spring is given by the 
following equation.
The units of the area, and thus, of the potential energy, are newtonámeters,
or joules.
How does the net force depend upon position? When an object hangs on
a spring, the spring stretches until its upward force, 
Fsp, balances the objectÕs weight, 
Fg, as shown in 
Figure 14-3a.The block is then in itsequilibrium position. If you pull the object down, as in 
Figure 14-3b,
thespring force increases, producing a net force upward. When you let go 

of the object, it accelerates in the upward direction, as in 
Figure 14-3c.However, as the stretch of the 
spring is reduced, the upward force 
decreases.
Potential Energy in a Spring

spring constant and the square of the displacement.

Simple harmonicmotion is demonstrated by thevibrations of an object hanging on a spring.In Figure 14-3d,the upward force of the spring and the objectÕs weight are
equalÑthere is no acceleration. Because there is no net force, the object

continues its upward velocity, moving above the equilibrium position. In

Figure 14-3e,
the net force is in the direction opposite the displacementof the object and is directly proportional to the displacement, so the object
moves with a simple harmonic motion. The object returns to the equilib-

rium position, as in Figure 14-3f.Math HandbookOperations with Significant Digits

Fnet, the vector sumof Ftand Fg, is the restoring force
for the pendulum.When the external force holding the object is released, as in Figure 14-3c,the net force and the acceleration are at their maximum, and the velocity
is zero. As the objectpasses through the equilibrium point, Figure 14-3d,the net force is zero, and so is the acceleration. Does the objectstop? No,it would take a net downward force 
to slow the 
object, and that will notexist until the objectrises above the 
equilibrium position. When the objectcomes to the highest position in its oscillation, the net force and the accel-
eration are again at their maximum, and the velocity is 
zero. The objectmoves down through the equilibrium position to its starting point and

continues to move in this vibratory manner. The period of oscillation, 
T,depends upon the mass of the objectand the strength of the spring. AutomobilesElastic potential energy is an important part of the designand building of todayÕs automobiles. Every year, new models of cars are

tested to see how well they withstand damage when they crash into barri-

cades at low speeds. A carÕs ability to retain its integrity depends upon how

much of the kinetic energy it had before the crash can be converted into

the elastic potential energy of the frame after the crash. Many bumpers are

modified springs that store energy as a car hits a barrier in a slow-speed

collision. After the car stops and the spring is compressed, the spring
returns to its equilibrium position, and the car recoils from the barrier.
Pendulums
Simple harmonic motion also can be demonstrated by the swing of a
pendulum. A simple pendulumconsists of a massive object, called the
bob, suspended by a string or light rod of length 
l. After the bob is pulledto one side and released, it swings back and forth, as shown in 
Figure 14-4.The string or rod exerts a tension force, 
FT, and gravity exerts a force, 
Fg, onthe bob. The vector sum of the two forces produces the net force, shown at

three positions in Figure 14-4. At the left and right positions shown in

Figure 14-4, the net force and acceleration are maximum, and the velocity

is zero. At the middle position in Figure 14-4, the net force and accelera-

tion are zero, and the velocity is maximum. You can see that the net force

is a restoring force; that is, it is opposite the direction of the displacement

of the bob and is trying to restore the bob to its equilibrium position.1.How much force is necessary to stretch a spring 0.25 m when the

°) the restoring force is proportionalto the displacement, so the movement is simple harmonic motion. The
period of a pendulum is given by the following equation. 
Notice that the period depends only upon the length of the pendulum andthe acceleration due to gravity, not on the mass of the bob or the ampli-

tude of oscillation. One application of the pendulum is to measure g,which can vary slightly at different locations on Earth.

Resonance 
To get a playground swing going, you ÒpumpÓ it by leaning back and
pulling the chains at the same point in each swing, or a friend gives you
repeated pushes at just the right times. 
Resonance
occurs when smallforces are applied at regular intervals to a vibrating or oscillating object

and the amplitude of the vibration increases. The time interval between

applications of the force is equal to the period of oscillation. Other famil-
iar examples of resonance include rocking a car to free it from a snowbank

and jumping rhythmically on a trampoline or a diving board. The large-

amplitude oscillations caused by resonance can create stresses. Audiences

in theater balconies, for example, sometimes damage the structures by

jumping up and down with a period equal to the natural oscillation period

of the balcony.
Resonance is a special form of simple harmonic motion in which the
additions of small amounts of force at specific times in the motion of 
an object cause a larger and larger displacement. Resonance from wind,

combined with the design of the bridge supports, may have caused the

original Tacoma Narrows Bridge to collapse.
Foucault Pendulum
AFoucault pendulum has a long
wire, about 16 m in length, with a
heavy weight of about 109 kg

attached to one end. According to

NewtonÕs first law of motion, a
swinging pendulum will keep
swinging in the same direction

unless it is pushed or pulled in

another direction. However,

because Earth rotates every 24 h

underneath the pendulum, to an
observer it would seem as though
the pendulumÕs direction of swing
has changed. To demonstrate this,

pegs are arranged in a circle on
the floor beneath so that the
swinging pendulum will knock
them down as the floor rotates. 

At the north pole, this apparent

rotation would be 15

14.2Wave Properties
Both particles and waves carry energy, but there is an important differ-
ence in how they do this. Think of a ball as a particle. If you toss the
ball to a friend, the ball moves from you to your friend and carries energy.

However, if you and your friend hold the ends of a rope and you give your

end a quick shake, the rope remains in your hand. Even though no matter

is transferred, the rope still carries energy through the wave that you created.

A waveis a disturbance that carries energy through matter or space. 
You have learned how NewtonÕs laws of motion and principles of 
conservation of energy govern the behavior of particles. These laws and

principles also govern the motion of waves. There are many kinds of waves

that transmit energy, including the waves you cannot see.
Mechanical Waves
Water waves, sound waves, and the waves that travel down a rope or
spring are types of mechanical waves. Mechanical waves require a medium,

such as water, air, ropes, or a spring. Because many other waves cannot be

directly observed, mechanical waves can serve as models.
Transverse waves
The two disturbances shown in 
Figure 14-5aarecalled wave pulses. A 
wave pulse
is a single bump or disturbance that trav-
els through a medium. If the wave moves up and down at the same rate, 
a periodic wave
is generated. Notice in Figure 14-5a that the rope is dis-turbed in the vertical direction, but the pulse travels horizontally. A wave

with this type of motion is called a transverse wave. A 
transverse wave
isone that vibrates perpendicular to the direction of the waveÕs motion.
Longitudinal waves
In a coiled-spring toy, you can create a wave pulse in
a different way. If you squeeze together several turns of the coiled-spring
toy and then suddenly release them, pulses of closely-spaced turns will

move away in both directions, as shown in 
Figure 14-5b.
This is called alongitudinal wave. 
The disturbance is in the same direction as, or parallel
to, the direction of the waveÕs motion. Sound waves are longitudinal

waves. 
Fluids usually transmit only longitudinal waves.

A quick shake of a rope sends out transverse wave
pulses in both directions

spring toy sends out longitudinalwave pulses in both directions

These two
photographs were taken 0.20 s

apart. During that time, the crest

moved 0.80 m. The velocity of the

wave is 4.0 m/s.abSurface waves
Waves that are deep in a lake or ocean are longitudinal; at
the surface of the water, however, the particles move in a direction that is
both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of wave motion, as shown

in Figure 14-6.Each of the waves is a 
surface wave,
which has character-istics of both transverse and longitudinal waves. The energy of water waves

usually comes from distant storms, whose energy initially came from the

heating of Earth by solar energy. This energy, in turn, was carried to Earth

by transverse electromagnetic waves from the Sun.
Measuring a Wave
There are many ways to describe or measure a wave. Some characteris-
tics depend on how the wave is produced, whereas others depend on the

medium through which the wave travels.
SpeedHow fast does a wave move? The speed of the pulse shown in
Figure 14-7can be found in the same way as the speed of a moving car 
is determined. First, measure the displacement of the wave peak, 
d, then divide this by the time interval, 
t, to find the speed, given by 
vd/t. The speed of a periodic wave can be found in the same way. For
most mechanical waves, 
both transverse and longitudinal, the speed
depends only on the medium through which the waves move.

AmplitudeHow does the pulse generated by gently shaking a rope differ
from the pulse produced by a violent shake? The difference is similar to 
the difference between a ripple in a pond and an ocean breaker: they 

have different amplitudes. You have learned that the amplitude of a wave

is the maximum displacement of the wave from its position of rest, or

equilibrium. Two similar waves having different amplitudes are shown in

Figure 14-8.A waveÕs amplitude depends on how it is generated, but not on its speed.
More work must be done to generate a wave with a greater amplitude. For

example, strong winds produce larger water 
waves than those formed 
by gentle breezes. Waves with greater amplitudes transfer more energy.

383VibratingbladePPPPFigure 14-9
One end of astring, with a piece of tape at
point P, is attached to a blade

vibrating 25 times per second.

Note the change in position of
point P over time.Whereas a small wave might move sand on a beach a

few centimeters, a giant wave can uproot and move a

tree. For waves that move at the same speed, the rate at

which energy is transferred is proportional to the square
of the amplitude. Thus, doubling the amplitude of a

wave 
increases the amount of energy it transfers eachsecond by a factor of 4.
Wavelength
Rather than focusing on one point on a
wave, 
imagine taking a snapshot of the wave so that 
you can see the whole 
wave at 
one instant in time.
Figure 14-8 shows each low point, called a 
trough,andeach high point, called a crest,of a wave. The shortest
distance between points where the wave pattern repeats
itself is called the wavelength.
Crests are spaced by one wavelength. Each
trough also is one wavelength from the next. The Greek letter lambda, 
,represents wavelength.
PhaseAny two points on a wave that are one or more whole wavelengths
apart are in phase. Particles in the medium are said to be in phase with one
another when they have the same displacement from equilibrium and the

same velocity. Particles in the medium with opposite displacements and

velocities are 180
°out of phase. A crest and a trough, for example, are 180
°out of phase with each other. Two particles in a wave can be anywhere

from 0°to 180°out of phase with one another.
Period and frequency
Although wave speed and amplitude can describe
both pulses and periodic waves, period, 
T, and frequency, 
f, apply only toperiodic waves. You have learned that the period of a simple harmonic

oscillator, such as a pendulum, is the time it takes for the motion of the

oscillator to complete one cycle. Such an oscillator is usually the source, or

cause, of a periodic wave. The period of a wave is equal to the period of the

source. In 
Figures 14-9athrough 14-9d,the period, T, equals 0.04 s,
which is the time it takes the source to complete one cycle. The same time

is taken by P, a point on the rope, to return to its initial phase.

(b).The
amplitude, or displacement, is

graphs represent the same wave,

what is its speed? 
The frequencyof a wave, 
f, is the number of complete oscillations it makeseach second. Frequency is measured in hertz. One hertz (Hz) is one oscilla-
tion per second. The frequency and period of a wave 
are related by the 
following equation. 
Both the period and the frequency of a wave depend only on its source.
They do not depend on the waveÕs speed or the medium.
Although you can directly measure a 
wavelength, the 
wavele
ngthdepends on both the frequency of the oscillator and the speed of the wave.
In the time interval of one period, a 
wave moves 
one wavelength.
Therefore, the wavelength of a wave is the speed multiplied by the period,
vT. Because the frequency is usually more easily found than the period, this equation is most often written in the following way. 
Picturing waves
If you took a snapshot of a transverse wave on a spring,
it might look like one of the waves shown in Figure 14-8. This snapshot
could be placed on a graph grid to show more information about the wave,

as in Figure 14-10a.
Similarly, if you record the motion of a single parti-
cle, such as point P in Figure 14-9, that motion can be plotted on a 

displacement-versus-time graph, as in 
Figure 14-10b.
The period is foundusing the time axis of the graph. Longitudinal waves can also be depicted

by graphs, where the 
y-axis could represent pressure, for example.

carries, only the medium determines the waveÕs speed.

When a wave encounters the boundary of the medium in which it
is traveling, it often reflects back into the medium. In other
instances, some or all of the 
wave 
passes through the boundary intoanother medium, often changing direction at the boundary. In addition,

many properties of 
wave 
behavior result from the fact that two or 
more waves can exist in the same medium at the same timeÑquite unlike
particles.
Waves at Boundaries
Recall from Section 14.2 that the speed of a mechanical wave depends
only on the properties of the medium it passes through, not on the waveÕs

amplitude or frequency. For water waves, the depth of the water affects

wave 
speed. For sound waves in air, the temperature affects wave speed. For
waves on a spring, the speed depends upon the springÕs tension and mass

per unit length.Examine what happens when a wave moves across a boundary from one
medium into another, as in two springs of different thicknesses joined

end-to-end. Figure 14-11
shows a wave pulse moving from a large spring
into a smaller one. The wave that strikes the boundary is called the 

incident wave.
One pulse from the larger spring continues in the smallerspring, but at the specific speed of waves traveling through the smaller

spring. Note that this transmitted wave pulse remains upward.
Some of the energy of the incident waveÕs pulse is reflected backward
into the larger spring. This returning wave is called the 
reflected wave.
Whether or not the reflected wave is upright or inverted depends on the

characteristics of the two springs. For example, if the waves in the smaller

spring have a higher speed because the spring is heavier or stiffer, then the

reflected wave will be inverted.

the two springs is a boundarybetween two media. A pulse

5NNNNWhat happens if the boundary is a wall rather than another spring?
When a wave pulse is sent down a spring connected to a rigid wall, the
energy transmitted is reflected back from the wall, as shown in 
Figure 14-12.The wall is the boundary of a new medium through which the wave

attempts to pass. Instead of passing through, the pulse is reflected from the

wall with almost exactly the same amplitude as the pulse of the incident

wave. 
Thus, almost all the waveÕs energy is reflected back. Very little energy
is transmitted into the wall. Also note that the pulse is inverted. If the

spring were attached to a loose ring around a pole, a free-moving bound-

ary, the wave would not be inverted.
Superposition of Waves
Suppose a pulse traveling down a spring meets a reflected pulse coming
back. In this case, two waves exist in the same place in the medium at the

same time. Each wave affects the medium independently. The 
principle ofsuperpositionstates that the displacement of a medium caused by two 
or more waves is the algebraic sum of the displacements caused by the

individual waves. In other words, two or more waves can combine to form

a new wave. If the waves move in opposite directions, they can cancel or

form a new wave of lesser or greater amplitude. The result of the superpo-

sition of two or more waves is called 
interference.
abcFigure 14-13
When two equal
pulses meet, there is a point,
called the node (N), where the

medium remains undisturbed (a).Constructive interference results

in maximum interference at the

antinode (A) (b).If the oppositepulses have unequal amplitudes,

cancellation is incomplete 
(c).Tom Pantages
387-391 CH14-S3-845813  3/30/04  5:49 AM  Page 388Section 14.3Wave Behavior
389Wave interference
Wave interference can be either constructive or
destructive. When two pulses with equal but opposite amplitudes meet,
the displacement of the medium at each point in the overlap region is

reduced. The superposition of waves with equal but opposite amplitudes

causes destructive interference, as shown in 
Figure 14-13a.When thepulses meet and are in the same location, the displacement is zero. Point N,

which does not move at all, is called a 
node.
The pulses continue to move
and eventually resume their original form. 
Constructive interference occurs when 
wave 
displacements are in thesame direction. The result is a wave that has an amplitude greater than
those of any of the individual waves. 
Figure 14-13bshows the construc-
tive interference of two equal pulses. A larger pulse appears at point A

when the two 
waves meet. Point A has the largest displacement and is
called the antinode.
The two pulses pass through each other without
changing their shapes or sizes. If the pulses have unequal amplitudes, the

resultant pulse at the overlap is the algebraic sum of the two pulses, as

shown in 
Figure 14-13c.Standing waves
You can apply the concept of superimposed waves to the
control of the formation of large amplitude waves. If you attach one end
of a rope or coiled spring to a fixed point, such as a doorknob, and then

start to vibrate the other end, the wave leaves your hand, is reflected at the

fixed end, is inverted, and returns to your hand. When it reaches your

hand, the reflected wave is inverted and travels back down the rope. Thus,

when the wave leaves your hand the second time, its displacement is in the

same direction as it was when it left your hand the first time.
What if you want to increase the amplitude of the wave that you create?
Suppose you adjust the motion of your hand so that the period of vibra-
tion equals the time needed for the wave to make one round-trip from

your hand to the door and back. Then, the displacement given by your

hand to the rope each time will add to the displacement of the reflected
wave. As a 
result, the oscillation of the rope in one segment will be muchgreater than the motion of your hand. You

would expect this based on your knowledge

of constructive interference. This large-ampli-

tude oscillation is an example of mechanicalresonance. The nodes are at the ends of the

rope and an antinode is in the middle, as

shown in 
Figure 14-14a.Thus, the wave
appears to be standing still and is called a
standing wave.
You should note, however,
that the standing wave is 
the interference of the two traveling waves moving in oppo-

site directions. If you double the frequency 

of vibration, you can produce one more 

node and one more antinode in the rope.

Then it appears to vibrate in two segments.

Further increases in frequency produce even

more nodes and antinodes, as shown in

Figures 14-14b and c.Figure 14-14
Interference
produces standing waves in 
a rope. As the frequency is

increased, as shown from top 
to bottom, the number of nodes

and antinodes increases.

You have studied waves on a rope and on a spring reflecting from rigid
supports, where the amplitude of the waves is forced to be zero by destruc-

tive interference. These mechanical waves move in only one dimension.

However, waves on the surface of water move in two dimensions, and

sound waves and electromagnetic waves will later be shown to move in

three dimensions. How can two-dimensional waves be demonstrated?
Picturing waves in two dimensions
When you throw a small stone into
a calm pool of water, you see the circular crests and troughs of the result-
ing waves spreading out in all directions. You can sketch those waves by

drawing circles to represent the wave crests. If you dip your finger into

water with a constant frequency, the resulting sketch would be a series of

concentric circles, called wave fronts, centered on your finger. A 
wave front
is a line that represents the crest of a wave in two dimensions, and it can

be used to show waves of any shape, including circular waves and straight

waves. 
Figure 14-15ashows circular waves in water, and 
Figure 14-15bshows the wave fronts that represent those water waves. Wave fronts drawn

to scale show the wavelengths of the waves, but not their amplitudes.
Whatever their shape, two-dimensional 
waves always travel in a 
direction that is perpendicular to their wave fronts. That direction can be

represented by a 
ray,
which is a line drawn at a right angle to the crest of
the wave. When all you want to show is the direction in which a wave is

traveling, it is convenient to draw rays instead of wave fronts.
Reflection of waves in two dimensions

A lamp above the tank produces shadows below the tank that
show the locations of the crests of the waves. The wave pulse trav-

els toward a rigid barrier that reflects the wave: the incident wave

moves upward, and the reflected wave moves to the right. 
The direction of wave motion can be modeled by a ray diagram.
Figure 14-16bshows the ray diagram for the waves in the ripple
tank. The ray representing the incident wave is the arrow pointing

upward. The ray representing the reflected wave points to the right.
The direction of the barrier also is shown by a line, which is
drawn at a right angle, or perpendicular, to the barrier, called the

normal.The angle between the incident ray and the normal is called
the angle of incidence. The angle between the normal and the

reflected ray is called the angle of reflection. The 
law of reflection
states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.Refraction of waves in two dimensions
A ripple tank also can beused to model the behavior of waves as they move from one
medium into another. 
Figure 14-17ashows a glass plate placed in
a ripple tank. The water above the plate is shallower than the water

in the rest of the tank and acts like a different medium. As the
waves move from deep to shallow water, their speed decreases, 

and the direction of the waves changes. Because the waves in the

shallow water are generated by the waves in the deep water, their

frequency is not changed. Based on the equation v/f, the decrease inthe speed of the waves means that the wavelength is shorter in the shallower

water. The change in the direction of waves at the boundary between two

different media is known as 
refraction.Figure 14-17bshows a wave front
and ray model of refraction. When you study the reflection and refraction

of light in Chapter 17, you will learn the law of refraction, called SnellÕs law. 
You may not be aware that echoes are caused by the reflection of sound
off hard surfaces, such as the walls of a large warehouse or a distant 

cliff face. Refraction is partly responsible for rainbows. When white 

light passes through a raindrop, refraction separates the light into its 
individual colors.

Critical ThinkingAs another way to understand
wave reflection, cover the right-hand side of each
drawing in Figure 14-13a with a piece of paper. The

edge of the paper should be at point N, the node.
Now, concentrate on the resultant wave, shown in

darker blue. Note that it acts like a wave reflected

from a boundary. Is the boundary a rigid wall, or is it

open-ended? Repeat this exercise for Figure 14-13b.14.3Section Review

A pendulum can provide a simple model for the investigation of wave properties.
In this experiment, you will design a procedure to use the pendulum to examine

amplitude, period, and frequency of a wave. You also will determine the 

acceleration due to gravity from the period and length of the pendulum.

with a paper clip, and a sinker attached to the

paper clip. Be sure to check with your teacher
and have your design approved before you 

proceed with the lab.2.For this investigation, the length of the pendulum

is the length of the string plus half the length of
the bob. The 
amplitude is how far the bob ispulled from its equilibrium point. The frequency

is the cycles/s of the bob. The period is the

time for the bob to travel back and forth (one

cycle). When collect
ing data for the period, find
the time it takes to make tenc
ycles, and then
calculate the period in s/cycles. When finding

frequency, 
count how many cycles occur in 10 s,
and then convert your value to cycles/s.

and its foundation. To minimize vertical shak-
ing of a building, springs are inserted into the
vertical members of the framework. These

springs are made of a strong rubber compound
compressed within heavy structural steel cylin-

ders. Side
ways 
shaking is diminished by placing
sliding supports beneath the building columns.

These allow the structure to remain stationary

if the ground beneath it moves sidew
ays. 
Long structures, like tunnels and bridges,
must be constructed to survive vertical or hori-

zontal shearing fractures of the earth beneath.
The Bay Area Rapid Transit tunnel that runs

beneath San Francisco Bay has flexible couplings

for stability should the bay floor buckle.
New building designs reduce damage by earthquakes.
An earthquakeis the equivalent of a violent
explosion somewhere beneath the surface of
Earth. The mechanical waves that radiate from

an earthquake are both transve
rse and longitu-dinal. Transverse waves shake a structure 

horizontally, while longitudinal waves cause

vertical shaking. Earthquakes cannot be pre-

dicted or prevented, so we must construct our

buildings to withstand them.As our knowledge of earthquakes increases,
existing buildings must be retrofitted to with-
stand newly discovered types of earthquake-

related failures. 
Reducing Damage
Most bridges and parking ramps were built by stacking steel-

reinforced concrete sections atop one another.

Gravity keeps them in place. These structures

are immensely strong under normal conditions,

but they can be shaken apart by a strong earth-

quake. New construction codes dictate that

their parts must be bonded together by heavy

steel straps. 
Earthquake damage to buildings also can bereduced by allowing a small amount of con-

trolled movement between the building frame

Key Concepts
¥Periodic motion is any motion that repeats in a regular cycle.
¥Simple harmonic motion results when the restoring force on an object isdirectly proportional to the objectÕs displacement from equilibrium. 

Such a force obeys HookeÕs law. 
¥The elastic potential energy stored in a spring that obeys HookeÕs law is

expressed by the following equation.
¥The period of a pendulum can be found with the following equation.
T2glPEsp12kx2FkxKey Concepts
¥Waves transfer energy without transferring matter. 
¥In transverse waves, the displacement of the medium is perpendicular to 
the direction of wave motion. In longitudinal waves, the displacement 

is parallel to the direction of wave motion. 
¥Frequency is the number of cycles per second and is related to period by:
¥The wavelength of a continuous wave can be found by using the following

equation.vff1TKey Concepts
¥When a wave crosses a boundary between two media, it is partially
transmitted and partially reflected.¥The principle of superposition states that the displacement of a medium
resulting from two or more waves is the algebraic sum of the displacements

of the individual waves.
¥Interference occurs when two or more waves move through a medium at 

the same time.
¥When two-dimensional waves are reflected from boundaries, the angles of

incidence and reflection are equal.¥The change in direction of waves at the boundary between two different
media is called refraction.395physicspp.com/vocabulary_puzzlemaker

Apply ConceptsGravel roads often develop
regularly spaced ridges that are perpendicular to
the road, as shown in 
Figure 14-25.This effect,called washboarding, occurs because most cars

travel at about the same speed and the springs that

connect the wheels to the cars oscillate at about
the same frequency. If the ridges on a road are 

1.5 m apart and cars travel on it at about 5 m/s,

what is the frequency of the springsÕ oscillation?Writing in Physics

Doppler effectSound is an important part of existence for many living things.

Animals can use sound to hunt, attract mates, and warn of the
approach of predators. In humans, the sound of a siren can heighten our

awareness of our surroundings, while the sound of music can soothe and

relax us. From your everyday experiences, you already are familiar with 

several of the characteristics of sound, including volume, tone, and pitch.

Without thinking about it, you can use these, and other characteristics, to

categorize many of the sounds that you hear; for example, some sound pat-

terns are characteristic of speech, while others are characteristic of a musical
group. In this chapter, you will study the physical principles of sound,

which is a type of wave.
In Chapter 14, you learned how to describe waves in terms of speed, fre-
quency, wavelength, and amplitude. You also discovered how waves interact

with each other and with matter. Knowing that sound is a type of wave allows

you to describe some of its properties and interactions. First, however, 
thereis a question that you need to answer: exactly what type of wave is sound?

Before the bell isstruck, the air around it is a regionof average pressure 
(a).Once the bell is struck, however, the

vibrating edge creates regions of

high and low pressure. The dark

areas represent regions of higher

pressure; the light areas represent

regions of lower pressure 
(b).For
simplicity, the diagram shows the

regions moving in one direction; 
in reality, the waves move out
from the bell in all directions.Sound Waves
Put your fingers against your throat as you hum or speak. Can you feel
the vibrations? Have you ever put your hand on the loudspeaker of a boom

box? Figure 15-1shows a vibrating bell that also can represent your vocal
cords, a loudspeaker, or any other sound source. As it moves back and

forth, the edge of the bell strikes the particles in the air. When the edge

moves forward, air particles are driven forward; that is, the air particles

bounce off the bell with a greater velocity. When the edge moves backward,

air particles bounce off the bell with a lower velocity.
The result of these velocity changes is that the forward motion of the
bell produces a region where the air pressure is slightly higher than average.

The backward motion produces slightly below-average pressure. Collisions

among the air particles cause the pressure variations to move away from

the bell in all directions. If you were to focus at one spot, you would see

the value of the air pressure rise and fall, not unlike the behavior of a pen-

dulum. In this way, the pressure variations are transmitted through matter.
Describing soundA pressure variation that is transmitted through matter
is a sound wave.
Sound waves move through air because a vibrating
source produces regular variations, or oscillations, in air pressure. The air
particles collide, transmitting the pressure 
variations away from the source of the sound.

The pressure of the air oscillates about the mean
air pressure, as shown in 
Figure 15-2.The fre-quency of the wave is the number of oscillations

in pressure each second. The wavelength is the

distance between successive regions of high or

low pressure. Because the motion of the parti-

cles in air is parallel to the direction of thewaveÕsmotion, 
sound is a longitudinal wave.
The speed of sound in air depends on thetemperature, with the speed increasing by about

0.6 m/s for each 1°C increase in air temperature. 
At room temperature (20
°C), sound moves
through air at sea level at a speed of 343 m/s.

Sound also travels through solids and liquids.

In general, the speed of sound is greater inFigure 15-2
A coiled springmodels the compressions and
rarefactions of a sound wave (a).The pressure of the air rises and

falls as the sound wave propagates

to model changes in pressure.

Table 15-1
lists the speeds of sound waves
in various media. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum because there are no
particles to collide.
Sound waves share the general properties of other waves. For example,
they reflect off hard objects, such as the walls of a room. Reflected sound

waves are called echoes. The time required for an echo to return to the

source of the sound can be used to find the distance between the source

and the reflective object. This principle is used by bats, by some cameras,

and by ships that employ sonar. Two sound waves can interfere, causing

dead spots at nodes where little sound can be heard. As you learned in

Chapter 14, the frequency and wavelength of a wave are related to the

speed of the wave by the equation

Sound detectors convert sound energyÑthe kinetic energy of the vibrat-
ing air particlesÑinto another form of energy. A common detector is a
microphone, which converts sound waves into electrical energy. A micro-

phone consists of a thin disk that vibrates in response to sound waves and

produces an electrical signal. You will learn about this transformation

process in Chapter 25, during your study of electricity and magnetism.
The human ear
As shown in 
Figure 15-3,the human ear is a detectorthat receives pressure waves and converts them to electrical impulses.
Sound waves entering the auditory canal cause vibrations of the tympanic

membrane. Three tiny bones then transfer these vibrations to fluid in 

the cochlea. Tiny hairs lining the spiral-shaped cochlea detect

certain frequencies in the vibrating fluid. These hairs stimulate
nerve cells, which send impulses to the brain and produce the

sensation of sound.The ear detects sound waves over a wide range of frequencies
and is sensitive to an enormous range of amplitudes. In addi-

tion, human hearing can distinguish many different qualities 

of sound. Knowledge of both physics and biology is required 

to understand the complexities of the ear. The interpretation 

of sounds by the brain is even more complex, and it is not

totally understood.AuditorycanalAuditory

The human ear 
is a complex sense organ thattranslates sound vibrations into

that sometimes are referred to as

the hammer, anvil, and stirrup.

This decibel scale
shows the sound levels of somefamiliar sounds.Perceiving Sound
PitchMarin Mersenne and Galileo first determined that the pitchwe hear
depends on the frequency of vibration. Pitch can be given a name on the
musical scale. For instance, the middle C note has a frequency of 262 Hz. The

ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies. Most people cannot hear sounds

with frequencies below 20 Hz or above 16,000 Hz. Older people 
are lesssensitive to frequencies above 10,000 Hz than are young people. By 
age 70,
most people cannot hear sounds with frequencies above 8000 Hz. This

loss affects the ability to understand speech.LoudnessFrequency and wavelength are two physical characteristics of
sound waves. Another physical characteristic of sound waves is amplitude.
Amplitude is the measure of the variation in pressure along a wave. In

humans, sound is detected by the ear and interpreted by the brain. The

loudnessof a sound, as perceived by our sense of hearing, depends pri-
marily on the amplitude of the pressure wave.
The human ear is extremely sensitive to pressure variations in sound
waves, 
which is the amplitude of the wave. Recall from Chapter 13 that 
1 atm of pressure equals 1.01
105Pa. The ear can detect pressure-wave
amplitudes of less than one-billionth of an atmosphere, or 2
105Pa. At
the other end of the audible range, pressure variations of approximately 

20 Pa or greater cause pain. It is important to remember that the ear detects

only pressure variations at certain frequencies. Driving over a mountain

pass changes the pressure on your ears by thousands of pascals, but this

change does not take place at audible frequencies.
Because humans can detect a wide range in pressure variations, these
amplitudes are measured on a logarithmic scale called the sound level.
The unit of measurement for sound level is the 
decibel(dB). The soundlevel depends on the ratio of the pressure variation of a given sound wave

to the pressure variation in the most faintly heard sound, 2
105Pa. Such
an amplitude has a sound level of 0 dB. A sound with a pressure amplitude

ten times larger (2104Pa) is 20 dB. A pressure amplitude ten times
larger than this is 40 dB. Most people perceive a 10-dB increase in sound

level as about twice as loud as the original level. 
Figure 15-4shows the
sound level for a variety of sounds. In addition to pressure variations,

power and intensity of sound waves can be described by decibel scales.
Exposure to loud sounds, in the form of noise or music, has been shown
to cause the ear to lose its sensitivity, especially to high frequencies. The

longer a person is exposed to loud sounds, the greater the effect. A person

can recover from short-term exposure in a period of hours, but the effects
402-410 CH15-S1-845813  3/30/04  6:58 AM  Page 406ObserverBObserverASvsBAof long-term exposure can last for days or weeks. Long exposure to 100-dB
or greater sound levels can produce permanent damage. Many rock musi-

cians have suffered serious hearing loss, some as much as 40 percent.

Hearing loss also can result from loud music being transmitted to stereo
headphones from personal radios and CD players. In some cases, the lis-

teners are unaware of just how high the sound levels really are. Cotton

earplugs reduce the sound level only by about 10 dB. Special ear inserts can

provide a 25-dB reduction. Specifically designed earmuffs and inserts as

shown in 
Figure 15-5, can reduce the sound level by up to 45 dB.
Loudness, as perceived by the human ear, is not directly proportional to
the pressure variations in a sound wave. The earÕs sensitivity depends on

both pitch and amplitude. Also, perception of pure tones is different from

perception of a mixture of tones.
The Doppler Effect
Have you ever noticed that the pitch of an ambulance, fire, or police siren
changed as the vehicle sped past you? The pitch was higher when the vehicle

was moving toward you, then it dropped to a lower pitch as the source moved

away. 
This frequency shift is called the Doppler effectand is shown in
Figure 15-6.The sound source, 
S, is moving to the right with a speed of 
vs.The waves that it emits spread in circles centered on the source at the time it

produced the waves. As the source moves toward the sound detector,

Observer A in 
Figure 15-6a,more waves are crowded into the space between
them. The wavelength is shortened to 
A. Because the speed of sound is notchanged, more crests reach the ear per second, which means that the fre-
quency of the detected sound increases. When the source is moving away

from the detector, Observer B in Figure 15-6a, the 
wavelength is lengthened
to Band the detected frequency is lower. 
Figure 15-6billustrates theDoppler effect for a moving source of sound on water waves in a ripple tank.
A Doppler shift also occurs if the detector is moving and the source is
stationary. In this case, the Doppler shift results from the relative velocity

of the sound waves and the detector. As the detector approaches the sta-

tionary source, the relative velocity is larger, resulting in an increase in the

wave 
crests reaching the detector each second. As the detector recedes fromthe source, the relative velocity is smaller, resulting in a decrease in the

wave 
crests reaching the detector each second.Figure 15-5
Continuousexposure to loud sounds can
cause serious hearing loss. In

many occupations, workers, 
such as this flight controller, 
must wear ear protection.Figure 15-6

In the Doppler effect equation, vis the velocity of the sound wave,

fsis thefrequency of the wave 
emitted by the source, and 
fdis the frequencyreceived by the detector. This equation applies when the source is moving,
when the observer is moving, and when both are moving.
As you solve problems using the above equation, be sure to define the
coordinate system so that the positive direction is from the source to the

detector. The sound waves will be approaching the detector from the source,

so the velocity of sound is always positive. Try drawing diagrams to confirm

that the term (vvd)/(vvs)behaves as you would predict based on what
you have learned about the Doppler effect. Notice that for a source moving

toward the detector (positive direction, which results in a smaller denom-

inator compared to a stationary source) and for a detector moving toward

the source (negative direction and increased numerator compared to a 

stationary detector), the detected frequency, 
fd, increases. Similarily, if the
source moves away from the detector or if the detector moves away from

the source, then 
fddecreases. Read the Connecting Math to Physics feature
below to see how the Doppler effect equation reduces when the source or

observer is stationary.

physicspp.com/self_check_quizThe Doppler effect occurs in all wave motion, both mechanical and elec-
tromagnetic. It has many applications. Radar detectors use the Doppler
effect to measure the speed of baseballs and automobiles. Astronomers

observe light from distant galaxies and use the Doppler effect to measure

their speeds and infer their distances. Physicians can detect the speed of the

moving heart wall in a fetus by means of the Doppler effect in ultrasound.

Bats use the Doppler effect to detect and catch flying insects. When an

insect is flying faster than a bat, the reflected frequency is lower, but when

the bat is catching up to the insect, as in Figure 15-7,the reflected fre-quency is higher. Not only do bats use sound waves to navigate and locate

their prey, but they often must do so in the presence of other bats. This

means they must discriminate their own calls and reflections against a

background of many other sounds of many frequencies. Scientists con-

tinue to study bats and their amazing abilities to use sound waves.

produces.
abIn the middle of the nineteenth century, German physicist Hermann
Helmholtz studied sound production in musical instruments and thehuman voice. In the twentieth century, scientists and engineers developed

electronic equipment that permits not only a detailed study of sound, but
also the creation of electronic musical instruments and recording devices
that allow us to listen to music whenever and wherever we wish.
Sources of Sound
Sound is produced by a vibrating object. The vibrations of the object
create particle motions that cause pressure oscillations in the air. A loud-

speaker has a cone that is made to vibrate by electrical currents. The surface

of the cone creates the sound waves that travel to your ear and allow you

to hear music. Musical instruments such as gongs, cymbals, and drums are

other examples of vibrating surfaces that are sources of sound.The human voice is produced by vibrations of the vocal cords, which are
two membranes located in the throat. Air from the lungs rushing through

the throat starts the vocal cords vibrating. The frequency of vibration is

controlled by the muscular tension placed on the vocal cords.
In brass instruments, such as the trumpet and tuba, the lips of the per-
former vibrate, as shown in 
Figure 15-8a.Reed instruments, such as the
clarinet and saxophone, have a thin wooden strip, or reed, that vibrates as

a result of air blown across it, as shown in 
Figure 15-8b.
In flutes andorgan pipes, air is forced across an opening in a pipe. Air moving past the

opening sets the column of air in the instrument into vibration.In stringed instruments, such as the piano, guitar, and violin, wires or
strings are set into vibration. In the piano, the wires are struck; in the gui-
tar, they are plucked; and in the violin, the friction of the bow causes the

strings to vibrate. Often, the strings are attached to a sounding board that

vibrates with the strings. The vibrations of the sounding board cause the

pressure oscillations in the air that we hear as sound. Electric guitars use

electronic devices to detect and amplify the vibrations of the guitar strings.

AircolumnTuning
forkHammerResonance in Air Columns
If you have ever used just the mouthpiece of a brass or reed instrument,
you know that the vibration of your lips or the reed alone does not make
a sound with any particular pitch. The long tube that makes up the instru-

ment must be attached if music is to result. When the instrument is played,

the air within this tube vibrates at the same frequency, or in resonance,

with a particular vibration of the lips or reed. Remember that resonance

increases the amplitude of a vibration by repeatedly applying a small 

external force at the same natural frequency. The length of the air column

determines the frequencies of the vibrating air that will be set into reso-
nance. For many instruments, such as flutes, saxophones, and trombones,

changing the length of the column of vibrating air varies the pitch of the

instrument. The mouthpiece simply creates a mixture of different frequen-
cies, and the resonating air column acts on a particular set of frequencies

to amplify a single note, turning noise into music.
A tuning fork above a hollow tube can provide resonance in an air 
column, as shown in 
Figure 15-9.The tube is placed in water so that the
bottom end of the tube is below the water surface. A resonating tube with

one end closed to air is called a closed-pipe resonator.
The length of theair column is changed by adjusting the height of the tube above the water.

If the tuning fork is struck with a rubber hammer and the length of the air
column is varied as the tube is lifted up and down in the water, the sound

alternately becomes louder and softer. The sound is loud when the air 

column is in resonance with the tuning fork. A resonating air column
intensifies the sound of the tuning fork.Standing pressure wave
How does resonance occur? The vibrating 
tuning fork produces a sound wave. This wave of alternate high- and low-
pressure variations moves down the air column. When the wave hits the

water surface, it is reflected back up to the tuning fork, as indicated in

Figure 15-10a.
If the reflected high-pressure wave reaches the tuning fork
at the same moment that the fork produces another high-pressure wave,

then the emitted and returning waves reinforce each other. This reinforce-

ment of waves produces a standing wave, and resonance is achieved.
An open-pipe resonatoris a resonating tube with both ends open thatalso will resonate with a sound source. In this case, the sound wave does

not reflect off a closed end, but rather off an open end. The pressure of the
reflected wave is inverted; for example, if a high-pressure wave strikes the

open end, a low-pressure wave will rebound, as shown in 
Figure 15-10b.
Resonance lengthsA standing soundwave in a 
pipe can be represented by a
sine wave, as shown in 
Figure 15-11.
Sine waves can represent either the air

pressure or the displacement of the air
particles. You can see that standing

waves have nodes and antinodes. In the

pressure graphs, the nodes are regions

of mean atmospheric pressure, and at the

antinodes, the pressure oscillates between

its maximum and minimum values.

Raising or lowering
the tube changes the length of

the air column. When the column

is in resonance with the tuning
fork, the sound is loudest.

odd number of quarter

wavelengths.In the case of the displacement graph, the antinodes are regions of high displacement and the nodes are regions of low displacement. 
In both cases,
two antinodes (or two nodes) are separated by one-half wavelength.
Resonance frequencies in a closed pipe
The shortest column of air thatcan have an antinode at the closed end and a node at the open end is one-
fourth of a wavelength long, as shown in 
Figure 15-12.As the frequencyis increased, additional resonance lengths are found at half-wavelength

intervals. Thus, columns of length 
/4, 3/4, 5/4, 7/4, and so on will allbe in resonance with a tuning fork.In practice, the first resonance length is slightly longer than one-fourth
of a wavelength. This is because the pressure variations do not drop to zero

exactly at the open end of the pipe. Actually, the node is approximately 

0.4 pipe diameters beyond the end. Additional resonance lengths, how-

ever, are spaced by exactly one-half of a wavelength. Measurements of the

spacing between resonances can be used to find the velocity of sound in

air, as shown in the next Example Problem.
Hearing and Frequency
The human auditory canal acts 
as a closed-pipe resonator that

increases the earÕs sensitivity for

frequencies between 2000 and

5000 Hz, but the full range of

frequencies that people hear

extends from 20 to 20,000 Hz. 
A dogÕs hearing extends to
frequencies as high as 45,000 Hz,

and a catÕs extends to frequencies

as high as 100,000 Hz.Section 15.2The Physics of Music

An open piperesonates when its length is 
an even number of quarter
wavelengths.Resonance frequencies in an open pipe
The shortest column of air thatcan have nodes at both ends is one-half of a wavelength long, as shown in

Figure 15-13.As the frequency is increased, additional resonance lengthsare found at half-wavelength intervals. Thus, columns of length 
/2, ,3/2, 2, and so on will be in resonance with a tuning fork.If open and closed pipes of the same length are used as resonators, the
wavelength of the resonant sound for the open pipe will be half as long as

that for the closed pipe. Therefore, the frequency will be twice as high for

the open pipe as for the closed pipe. For both pipes, resonance lengths are
spaced by half-wavelength intervals.
Hearing resonance
Musical instruments use resonance to increase theloudness of particular notes. Open-pipe resonators include flutes and 
saxophones. Clarinets and the hanging pipes under marimbas and xylo-

phones are examples of closed-pipe resonators. If you shout into a long

tunnel, the booming sound you hear is the tunnel acting as a resonator.

The seashell in Figure 15-14acts as a closed-pipe resonator.
Resonance on Strings
Although the waveforms on vibrating strings vary in shape, depending
upon how they are produced, such as by plucking, bowing, or striking,

they have many characteristics in common with standing waves on springs
and ropes, which you studied in Chapter 14. A string on 

an instrument is clamped at both ends, and therefore, the

string must have a node at each end when it vibrates. In

Figure 15-15,you can see that the first mode of vibration
has an antinode at the center and is one-half of a wavelength

long. The next resonance occurs when one wavelength fits on

the string, and additional standing waves arise when the

string length is 3/2, 2, 5/2, and so on. As with an openpipe, the resonant frequencies are whole-number multiples

of the lowest frequency. 
The speed of a wave on a string depends on the tension of
the string, as well as its mass per unit length. This makes it

possible to tune a stringed instrument by changing the ten-

sion of its strings. The tighter the string, the faster the wave

moves along it, and therefore, the higher the frequency of its

standing waves.

A graph of puresound versus time (a)and agraph of clarinet sound waves

versus time (b)are shown.abBecause strings are so small in cross-sectional area, they move very little
air when they vibrate. This makes it necessary to attach them to a sound-
ing board, which transfers their vibrations to the air and produces a
stronger sound wave. Unlike the strings themselves, the sounding board

should not resonate at any single frequency. Its purpose is to convey the

vibrations of all the strings to the air, and therefore it should vibrate well

at all frequencies produced by the instrument. Because of the complicated

interactions among the strings, the sounding board, and the air, the design

and construction of stringed instruments are complex processes, considered

by many to be as much an art as a science.
Sound Quality
A tuning fork produces a soft and uninteresting sound. This is becauseits tines vibrate like simple harmonic oscillators and produce the 
simple sine wave shown in 
Figure 15-16a.Sounds made by the human
voice and musical instruments are much more complex, like the wave in

Figure 15-16b.
Both waves have the same frequency, or pitch, but they
sound very different. The complex wave is produced by using the principle 

of superposition to add waves of many frequencies. The shape of the 
wave 
depends on the relative amplitudes of these frequencies. In musical
terms, the difference between the two waves is called timbre, tone color, or

tone quality.

The sound spectrum: fundamental and harmonics
The complex soundwave in 
Figure 15-16b was made by a clarinet. Why does the clarinet pro-
duce such a sound wave? The air column in a clarinet acts as a closed pipe.
Look back at Figure 15-12, which shows three resonant frequencies for a

closed pipe. Because the clarinet acts as a closed pipe, for a clarinet of

length Lthe lowest frequency, 
f1, that will be resonant is v/4L. This lowest
frequency is called the fundamental.A closed pipe also will resonate at 3f1, 5f1, and so on. These higher frequencies, which are odd-number
multiples of the fundamental frequency, are called 
harmonics.
It is theaddition of these harmonics that gives a clarinet its distinctive timbre.
Some instruments, such as an oboe, act as open-pipe resonators. Their
fundamental frequency, which is also the first harmonic, is 
f1v/2Lwithsubsequent harmonics at 2f1, 3f1, 4f1, and so on. Different combinationsand amplitudes of these harmonics give each instrument its own unique tim-

bre. A graph of the amplitude of a wave versus its frequency is called a sound

spectrum. The spectra of three instruments are shown in

pitches are played at the same time, the resulting sound can be either pleas-

ant or jarring. In musical terms, several pitches played together are called

a chord. An unpleasant set of pitches is called dissonance.
If the combi-nation is pleasant, the sounds are said to be in consonance.
What makes a sound pleasant to listen to? Different cultures have dif-
ferent definitions, but most Western cultures accept the definitions of

Pythagoras, who lived in ancient Greece. Pythagoras experimented by

plucking two strings at the same time. He noted that pleasing sounds

resulted when the strings had lengths in small, whole-number ratios, for

example 1:2, 2:3, or 3:4. This means that their pitches (frequencies) will
also have small, whole-number ratios.
Musical intervals
Two notes with frequencies related by the ratio 1:2 are
said to differ by an octave. For example, if a note has a frequency of 440 Hz,
a note that is one octave higher has a frequency of 880 Hz. The funda-

mental and its harmonics are related by octaves; the first harmonic is one

octave higher than the fundamental, the second is two octaves higher, and

so on. The sum of the fundamental and the first harmonic is shown in

Figure 15-18a.It is the ratio of two frequencies, not the size of the inter-
val between them, that determines the musical interval.
In other musical intervals, two pitches may be close together. For exam-
ple, the ratio of frequencies for a Òmajor thirdÓ is 4:5. A typical major third

is made up of the notes C and E. The note C has a frequency of 262 Hz, 
so E has a frequency of (5/4)(262 Hz) = 327 Hz. In the same way, notes 

in a ÒfourthÓ (C and F) have a frequency ratio of 3:4, and those in a ÒfifthÓ

(C and G) have a ratio of 2:3. Graphs of these pleasant sounds are shown

in Figure 15-18. More than two notes sounded together also can produce

consonance. The three notes called do, mi, and sol make a major chord.

For at least 2500 y
ears, this has been recognized as the sweetest of the three-
note chords; it has the frequency ratio of 4:5:6.Beats
You have seen that consonance is defined in terms of the ratio of fre-
quencies. When the ratio becomes nearly 1:1, the frequencies become very

close. Two frequencies that are nearly identical interfere to produce high

and low sound levels, as illustrated in 
Figure 15-19.This oscillation ofwave 
amplitude is called a beat.The frequency of a beat is the magnitudeof difference between the frequencies of the two waves, 
fbeatfAfB.When the difference is less than 7 Hz, the ear detects this as a pulsation of
loudness. Musical instruments often are tuned by sounding one against

another and adjusting the frequency of one until the beat disappears.

Noise iscomposed of several frequencies
and involves random changes in
frequency and amplitude.
Sound Reproduction and Noise
How often do you listen to music produced directly by a human voice
or musical instrument? Most of the time, the music has been recorded and

played through electronic systems. To reproduce the sound faithfully, the

system must accommodate all frequencies equally. A good stereo system

keeps the amplitudes of all frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz the

same to within 3 dB.
A telephone system, on the other hand, needs only to transmit the infor-
mation in spoken language. Frequencies between 300 and 3000 Hz are 

sufficient. Reducing the number of frequencies present helps reduce the

noise. A noise wave is shown in 
Figure 15-20.
Many frequencies are 
present with approximately the same amplitude. While noise is not help-

ful in a telephone system, some people claim that listening to noise has 

a calming effect. For this reason, some dentists use noise to help their

patients relax.AmplitudeT2T1Time

sound waves (p waves), gravity waves, and 

surface gravity waves all occur in the Sun. 

All of these waves are composed of oscillating 
particles, 
but different forces cause theoscillations.
For sound waves, pressure differences
cause the particles to oscillate. In the

Sun, sound waves travel through the 

convective 
zone, which is just under 
the surface, or photosphere. The sound

waves do not travel in a straight line, 

as shown in the image.
Ringing like a BellThe soundwaves in the Sun cause the surface of 

the Sun to vibrate in the radial direc-
tion, much like a ringing bell vibrates.

When a bell is rung, a clapper hits the
bell in one place and standing waves are
created. The surface of the Sun does have

standing waves, 
but they are not causedby one large event. Instead, scientists

hypothesize that many smaller disrup-

tions in the convective zone start most

of the sound waves in the Sun. Just like

boiling water in a pot can be noisy, bubbles

that are larger than the state of Texas form on

the surface of the Sun and start sound waves.
Unlike a pot of boiling water, the sound 
coming from the Sun is much too low for us to

hear. The A above middle C on the piano has a

period of 0.00227 s (
f440 Hz). The middlemode of oscillation of the waves in the Sun has

a period of 5 min (f0.003 Hz).
Because we cannot hear the sound waves
from the Sun, scientists measure the motion of
the surface of the Sun to learn about its sound
waves. 
Because a sound wave takes 2 h to travel
from one side of the Sun to the other, the Sun

must be observed for long time periods. This

necessity makes observations from Earth 

difficult because the Sun is not visible during
the night. In 1995, the Solar and HeliosphericObservatory(SOHO) was launched by NASA.
This satellite orbits Earth such that it always

can observe the Sun.
The motion of the surface of the Sun ismeasured by observing Doppler shifts in 

sunlight. The measured vibrations are a com-
plicated pattern that equals the sum of all of
the standing waves present in the Sun. Just like

a ringing bell, many overtones are present in

the Sun. Through careful analysis, the individual

standing waves in the Sun and their intensities

can be calculated.Results
Because composition, temperature,
and density affect the propagation of sound
waves, the 
SunÕs wave oscillations provide
information about its interior. SOHO results

have given insight into the rotation rate of the

Sun as a function of latitude and depth, as well

as the density and temperature of the Sun. These
results are compared to theoretical calculations
to improve our understanding of the Sun.
PhotosphereChromosphereConvective zoneRadiativezoneCorep1.HypothesizeHow do scientists sepa-
rate the surface motion due to sound
waves from the motion due to the 

rotation of the Sun?
2.Critical Thinking
Would sound waves
in another star, similar to the Sun but

different in size, have the same wave-

length as sound waves in the Sun?

Sound waves (p waves) travel through the SunÕs convective zone.

Key Concepts
¥Sound is a pressure variation transmitted through matter as a longitudinal
wave.
¥A sound wave has frequency, wavelength, speed, and amplitude. Sound waves

reflect and interfere.
¥The speed of sound in air at room temperature (20
°C) is 343 m/s. The speed
increases roughly 0.6 m/s with each 1°C increase in temperature.
¥Sound detectors convert the energy carried by a sound wave into another

form of energy. The human ear is a highly efficient and sensitive detector 

of sound waves.
¥The frequency of a sound wave is heard as its pitch.
¥The pressure amplitude of a sound wave can be measured in decibels (dB).
¥The loudness of sound as perceived by the ear and brain depends mainly 

on its amplitude.
¥The Doppler effect is the change in frequency of sound caused by the 

motion of either the source or the detector. It can be calculated with the

following equation.
fdfsvvvvdsKey Concepts
¥Sound is produced by a vibrating object in a material medium.
¥Most sounds are complex waves that are composed of more than one

frequency. 
¥An air column can resonate with a sound source, thereby increasing the

amplitude of its resonant frequency.
¥A closed pipe resonates when its length is /4, 3/4, 5/4, and so on. Its resonant frequencies are odd-numbered multiples of the fundamental.¥An open pipe resonates when its length is /2, 2/2, 3/2, and so on. Its resonant frequencies are whole-number multiples of the fundamental.¥A clamped string has a node at each end and resonates when its length is/2, 2/2, 3/2, and so on, just as with an open pipe. The stringÕs resonant
frequencies are also whole-number multiples of the fundamental.¥The frequencies and intensities of the complex waves produced by a musical
instrument determine the timbre that is characteristic of that instrument. ¥The fundamental frequency and harmonics can be described in terms of
resonance. 
¥Notes on a musical scale differ in frequency by small, whole-number ratios.

An octave has a frequency ratio of 1:2.
¥Two waves with almost the same frequency interfere to produce beats.

illuminanceLight and sound are two methods by which you can receive information.
Of the two, light seems to provide the greater variety of information.
The human eye can detect tiny changes in the size, position, brightness,

and color of an object. Our eyes usually can distinguish shadows from

solid objects and sometimes distinguish reflections of objects from the
objects themselves. In this section, you will learn where light comes from

and how it illuminates the universe around you.
One of the first things that you ever discovered about light, although
you may not have been conscious of your discovery, is that it travels in a

straight line. How do you know this? When a narrow beam of light, such

as that of a flashlight or sunlight streaming through a small window, is

made visible by dust particles in the air, you see the path of the light as a

straight line. When your body blocks sunlight, you see your outline in 

a shadow. Also, whenever you locate an object with your eyes and walk

toward it, you most likely walk in a straight path. These things are possible

only because light travels in straight lines. Based on this knowledge of how

light travels, models have been developed that describe how light works.

Ray Model of Light
Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion you studied in Chapter 6, believed
that light is a stream of fast-moving, unimaginably tiny particles, which he
called corpuscles. However, his model could not explain all of the properties

of light. Experiments showed that light also behaves like a wave. In the 
ray
model of light,light is represented as a ray that travels in a straight path,
the direction of which can be changed only by placing an obstruction in the

path, as shown in 
Figure 16-1.The ray model of light was introduced as a
way to study how light interacts with matter, regardless of whether light is

a particle or a wave. This study of light is called ray optics or geometric optics.
Sources of light
Rays of light come from sources of light. Our major
source of light is the Sun. Other natural sources of light include flames,
sparks, and even fireflies. In the past 100 years, humans have been able to

produce several other kinds of light sources. Incandescent bulbs, fluores-

cent lamps, television screens, lasers, and tiny, light-emitting diodes

(LEDs) are each a result of humans using electricity to produce light.What is the difference between sunlight and moonlight? Sunlight, of
course, is much, much brighter. There also is an important fundamental

difference between the two. The Sun is a 
luminous source,
an object that emits light. In contrast, the Moon is an illuminated source,
an objectthat becomes visible as a result of the light reflecting off it, as shown in

Figure 16-2.An incandescent lamp, such as a common lightbulb, is lumi-
nous because electrical energy heats a thin tungsten wire in the bulb andcauses it to glow. An incandescent 
source emits light as a result of its hightemperature. A bicycle reflector, on the other hand, works as an illumi-

nated source. It is designed to become highly visible when it is illuminated

by luminous automobile headlights.

transmitting (passing) through the object to your eyes. Media, such as
brick, that do not transmit light, but reflect some light, are opaquemedia.Media that transmit light, such as air and glass, are 
transparentmedia.Media that transmit light, but do not permit objects to be seen clearly
through them, are translucentmedia. Lamp shades and frosted lightbulbsare examples of objects that are made of translucent media. All three types
of media are illustrated in Figure 16-3.Transparent or translucent media
not only transmit light, but they also can reflect a fraction of the light. For

example, you often can see your reflection in a glass window.
Quantity of lightThe rate at which light energy is emitted from a lumi-nous source is called the luminous flux,P. The unit of luminous flux isthe lumen (lm). A typical 100-W incandescent lightbulb emits approxi-
mately 1750 lm. You can think of the luminous flux as a measure of the

rate at which light rays come out of a luminous source. Imagine placing a

lightbulb at the center of a 1-m-radius sphere, as shown in 
Figure 16-4.The lightbulb emits light in almost all directions. The 1750 lm of lumi-

nous flux characterizes all of the light that strikes the inside surface of the
sphere in a given unit of time. Even if the sphere was 2 m in radius, the

luminous flux of the lightbulb would be the same as for the 1-m-radius

sphere, because the total number of light rays does not increase.
Once you know the quantity of light being emitted by a luminous
source, you can determine the amount of illumination that the luminous

source provides to an object, such as a book. The illumination of a surface,

or the rate at which light strikes the surface, is called the 
illuminance,
E.You can think of this as a measure of the number of light rays that strike a

surface. Illuminance is measured in lux, lx, which is equivalent to lumens

per square meter, lm/m
2.Consider the setup shown in Figure 16-4. What is the illuminance of the
sphereÕs inside surface? The equation for the surface area of a sphere is 4
r2,so the surface area of this sphere is 4(1.00 m)24m2. The luminousflux striking each square meter of the sphere is 1750 lm/(4
m2)139 lx.At a distance of 1.00 m from the bulb, 139 lm strikes each square meter.

The illuminance of the inside of the sphere is 139 lx.abcFigure 16-4

E,produced by a point source oflight varies inversely as the 

square of the distance from the

What would happen if the sphere sur-
rounding the lamp were larger? If the sphere had a radius of 2.00 m, the

luminous flux still would total 1750 lm, but the area of the sphere would

be 4(2.00 m)216.0m2, four times larger than the 1.00-m sphere, as
shown in 
Figure 16-5.The illuminance of the inside of the 2.00-m sphereis 1750 lm/(16.0
m2) 34.8 lx, so 34.8 lm strikes each square meter.
The illuminance on the inside surface of the 2.00-m sphere is one-fourththe illuminance on the inside of the 1.00-m sphere. In the same way, the

inside of a sphere with a 3.00-m radius has an illuminance only (1/3)2, or1/9, as large as the 1.00-m sphere. Figure 16-5 shows that the illuminance

produced by a point source is proportional to 1/
r2, an inverse-square rela-
tionship. As the light rays spread out in straight lines in all directions from

a point source, the number of light rays available to illuminate a unit of area

decreases as the square of the distance from the point source.
Luminous intensitySome luminous sources are specified in candela, cd.A candela is not a measure of luminous flux, but of luminous intensity.
The luminous intensity of a point source is the luminous flux that falls on
1 m2of the inside of a 1-m-radius sphere. Thus, luminous intensity is
luminous flux divided by 4
. A bulb with 1750 lm of flux has an intensity
of 1750 lm/4
139 cd.In Figure 16-6,the lightbulb is twice as far away from the screen as the
candle. For the lightbulb to provide the same illuminance on the lightbulb

side of the screen as the candle does on the candle side of the screen, the
lightbulb would have to be four times brighter than the candle, and, there-

fore, the luminous intensity of the lightbulb would have to be four times

the luminous intensity of the candle.

How to Illuminate a Surface
How would you increase the illuminance of your desktop? You could
use a brighter bulb, which would increase the luminous flux, or you could
move the light source closer to the surface of your desk, thereby decreasing

the distance between the light source and the surface it is illuminating. To

make the problem easier, you can use the simplification that the light

source is a point source. Thus, the illuminance and distance will follow the

inverse-square relationship. The problem is further simplified if you

assume that light from the source strikes perpendicular to the surface of
the desk. Using these simplifications, the illuminance caused by a point

light source is represented by the following equation. 
Remember that the luminous flux of the light source is spreading 
out spherically in all directions, so only a fraction of the luminous flux 

is available to illuminate the desk. Use of this equation is valid only 

if the light from the luminous source strikes perpendicular to the surface 
it is illuminating. It is also only valid for luminous sources that are 

small enough or far enough away to be considered point sources. Thus, 

the equation does not give accurate values of illuminance for long, fluo-

rescent lamps or incandescent lightbulbs that are close to the surfaces that
they illuminate.
Point Source Illuminance
E4Pr2If an object is illuminated by a point source of light, then the illuminance at the
object is equal to 
the luminous flux of the light source, divided by the surface
area of the sphere, whose radius is equal to the distance the object is from the
light source.Illuminated MindsWhen
deciding how to achieve thecorrect illuminance on studentsÕ

desktops, architects must consider

the luminous flux of the lights 

as well as the distance of the

lights above the desktops. In

addition, the efficiencies of the 

light sources are an important

economic factor.

437Engineers who design lighting systems must understand how the light
will be used. If an even illumination is needed to prevent dark areas, 
the common practice is to evenly space normal lights over the area to be

illuminated, as was most likely done with the lights in your classroom.

Because such light sources do not produce truly even light, however, engi-

neers also design special light sources that control the spread of the light,
such that they produce even illuminations over large surface areas. Much

work has been done in this field with automobile headlights.
The Speed of LightFor light to travel from a source to an object to be illuminated, it must
travel across some distance. According to classical mechanics, if you can

measure the distance and the time it takes to travel that distance, you can 

calculate a speed. Before the seventeenth century, most people believed 

that light trav
eled instantaneously. Galileo was the first to hypothesize that
light has a 
finite speed, and to suggest a method of measuring its speedusing distance and time. His method, however, was not precise enough,

and he was forced to conclude 
that the speed of light is too fast to be meas-
ured over a distance of a few kilometers.
Danish astronomer Ole Roemer was the first to determine that light
does travel with a measurable speed. Between 1668 and 1674, Roemer

made 70 measurements of the 1.8-day orbital period of Io, one of JupiterÕs

moons. He recorded the times when Io emerged from JupiterÕs shadow, as

shown in 
Figure 16-8.He made his measurements as part of a project toimprove maps by calculating the longitude of locations on Earth. This is 

an early example of the needs of technology driving scientific advances.
After making many measurements, Roemer was able to predict when the
next eclipse of Io would occur. He compared his predictions with the

actual measured times and found that IoÕs orbital period increased on 

average by about 13 s per orbit when Earth was moving away from Jupiter

and decreased on average by about 13 s per orbit when Earth was

approaching Jupiter. Roemer believed that JupiterÕs moons were just as 

regular in their orbits as EarthÕs moon; thus, he wondered what might

cause this discrepancy in the measurement of IoÕs orbital period.
2341IoJupiterEarthShadowvIovJupiterSunFigure 16-8
Roemer measuredthe time between eclipses as Io
emerged from JupiterÕs shadow.
During successive eclipses, IoÕs

measured orbital period became

increasingly smaller or larger
depending on whether Earth was

moving toward (from position 3 to
1) or away from (from position 1
to 3) Jupiter. (Illustration not to

430-438 CH16-S1-845813  6/4/04  10:03 AM  Page 437physicspp.com/self_check_quizMeasurements of the speed of light
Roemer concluded that as Earth
moved away from Jupiter, the light from each new appearance of Io took
longer to travel to Earth because of the increasing distance to Earth.

Likewise, as Earth approached Jupiter, IoÕs orbital period seemed to

decrease. Roemer noted that during the 182.5 days that it took Earth 

to travel from position 1 to position 3, as shown in Figure 16-8, there 

were (185.2 days)(1 Io eclipse/1.8 days) 
103 Io eclipses. Thus, for 
light to travel the diameter of EarthÕs orbit, he calculated that it takes 

(103 eclipses)(13 s/eclipse)
1.3103s, or 22 min.
Using the presently known value of the diameter of EarthÕs orbit
(2.91011m), RoemerÕs value of 22 min gives a value for the speed of light
of 2.91011m/((22min)(60 s/min))
2.2108m/s. Today, the speed of 
light is known to be closer to 3.0
108m/s. Thus,
light takes 16.5 min, not22 min, to cross EarthÕs orbit. Nevertheless, Roemer had successfully

proved that light moves at a finite speed.
Although many measurements of the speed of light have been made, the
most notable were performed by American physicist Albert A. Michelson.

Between 1880 and the 1920s, he developed Earth-based techniques to meas-

ure the speed of light. In 1926, Michelson measured the time required forlight to make a round-trip between two California mountains 35 km apart.

Michelson used a set of rotating mirrors to measure such small time inter-
vals. MichelsonÕs best result was (2.997996
0.00004)108m/s. For this
work, he became the first American to receive a Nobel prize in science.
The speed of light in a vacuum is a very important and universal value;
thus it has its own special symbol, 
c. Based on the wave nature of light,
which you will study in the next section, the International Committee on

Weights and Measurements has measured and defined the speed of light in

a vacuum to be 
c299,792,458 m/s. For many calculations, the value 
c3.00108m/s is precise enough. At this speed, light travels 9.46
1012 kmin a year. This amount of distance is called a light-year.

MalusÕs law16.2The Wave Nature of Light
BarrierFigure 16-9
According to HuygensÕ principle, the crest of each wave can be thought
of as a series of point sources. Each point source creates a circular wavelet. All the
wavelets combine to make a flat wave front, except at the edge where circular wavelets

of the HuygensÕ points move away from the wave front.
Section 16.2The Wave Nature of Light
439You probably have heard that light is composed of waves, but what

evidence do you have that this is so? Suppose that you walk by the
open door of the band-rehearsal room at school. You hear the music as

you walk toward the rehearsal-room door long before you can see the band

members through the door. Sound seems to have reached you by bending

around the edge of the door, whereas the light that enables you to see the

band members has traveled only in a straight line. If light is composed of

waves, why doesnÕt light seem to act in the same way as sound does? 

In fact, light does act in the same way; however, the effect is much less

obvious with light than with sound.Diffraction and the Wave Model of Light
In 1665, Italian scientist Francesco Maria Grimaldi observed that the
edges of shadows are not perfectly sharp. He introduced a narrow beam of

light into a dark room and held a rod in front of the light such that it cast
a shadow on a white surface. The shadow cast by the rod on the white 

surface was wider than the shadow should have been if light traveled in a

straight line past the edges of the rod. Grimaldi also noted that the shadow

was bordered by colored bands. Grimaldi recognized this phenomenon as

diffraction,which is the bending of light around a barrier.
In 1678, Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens argued in favor of a wave
model to explain diffraction. According to HuygensÕ principle, all the

points of a wave front of light can be thought of as new sources of smaller

waves. 
These wavelets expand in every direction and are in step with one
another. A flat, or plane, wave front of light consists of an infinite number

of point sources in a line. As this wave front passes by an edge, the edge

cuts the wave front such that each circular wavelet generated by each

HuygensÕ point will propagate as a circular wave in the region where the

original wave front was bent, as shown in 
Figure 16-9.This is diffraction. 439-447 CH16-S2-845813  6/4/04  10:10 AM  Page 439440Chapter 16Fundamentals of Light

Differentcombinations of blue, green, andred light can produce yellow,

Red (7.00107 m)Violet (4.00
107 m)As white light crosses the boundary from air into glass and back into airin Figure 16-11, its wave nature causes each different color of light to be
bent, or refracted, at a different angle. This unequal bending of the differ-

ent colors causes the white light to be spread into a spectrum. This reveals

that different wavelengths of light interact in different but predictable ways

with matter.
Color by addition of lightWhite light can be formed from colored light ina variety of 
ways. For 
example, when the correct intensities of red, green, and
blue light are projected onto a white screen, as in Figure 16-12,the regionwhere these three colors overlap on the screen will appear to be white. Thus,
red, green, and blue light form white light when they are combined. This is
called the additive color process, which is used in color-television tubes. A

color-television tube contains tiny, dotlike sources of red, green, and blue

light. When all three colors of light have the correct intensities, the screen

appears to be white. For this reason, red, green, and blue are each called 

a primary color.
The primary colors can be mixed in pairs to form threeadditional colors, as shown in Figure 16-12. Red and green light together

produce yellow light, blue and green light produce cyan, and red and blue

light produce magenta. The colors yellow, cyan, and magenta are each called

a secondary color,
because each is a combination of two primary colors.
Figure 16-10
White light, when
passed through a prism, isseparated into a spectrum of colors.Figure 16-11
The spectrum of light ranges from the long, red wavelength to the short,
violet wavelength.Color
In 1666, possibly prompted by GrimaldiÕs publication of his diffraction
results, Newton performed experiments 
on the colors produced when a narrow beam of sunlight passed through a glass prism, as shown in
Figure 16-10.
Newton called the ordered arrangement of colors a spectrum.Using his corpuscle model of light, he believed that particles of light were

interacting with some unevenness in the glass to produce the spectrum.
To test this assumption, Newton allowed the spectrum from one prism
to fall on a second prism. If the spectrum was caused by irregularities in

the glass, he reasoned that the second prism would increase the spread in

colors. Instead, the second prism reversed the spreading of colors and

recombined them to form white light. After more experiments, Newton

concluded that white light is composed of colors, and that a property of

the glass other than unevenness caused the light to separate into colors.
Based on the work of Grimaldi, Huygens, and others, we know that light
has wave properties and that each color of light is associated with a wave-

length. Light falls within the range of wavelengths from about 400 nm

(4.00107m) to 700 nm (7.00
107m), as shown in 
Figure 16-11.
Thelongest wavelengths are seen as red light. As wavelength decreases, the

color changes to orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and finally, violet.

441As shown in Figure 16-12, yellow light can be made from red light and
green light. If yellow light and blue light are projected onto a white 
screen with the correct intensities, the surface will appear to be white.

Complementary colorsare two colors of light that can be combined to
make white light. Thus, yellow is a complementary color of blue, and vice

versa, because the two colors of light combine to make white light. In the

same way, cyan and red are complementary colors, as are magenta and

green. Yellowish laundry can be whitened with a bluing agent added to

detergent.Color by subtraction of light
As you learned in the first section of 
this chapter, objects can reflect and transmit light. They also can absorb
light. Not only does the color of an object depend on the wavelengths
present in the light that illuminates the object, but an objectÕs color 

also depends on what wavelengths are absorbed by the object and what

wavelengths are reflected. The natural existence or artificial placement 

of dyes in the material of an object, or pigments on its surface, give the

object color.
A dye is a molecule that absorbs certain wavelengths of light and trans-
mits or reflects others. When light is absorbed, its energy is taken into the

object that it strikes and is turned into other forms of energy. A red shirt is

red because the dyes in it reflect red light to our eyes. When white light falls

on the red object shown in 
Figure 16-13,the dye molecules in the object
absorb the blue and green light and reflect the red light. When only blue
light falls on the red object, very little light is reflected and the object

appears to be almost black.The difference between a dye and 
a pigment is that pigments usually aremade of crushed minerals, rather than plant or insect extracts. Pigment

particles can be seen with a microscope. A pigment that absorbs only one

primary color and reflects two from white light is called a 
primary pigment.Yellow pigment absorbs blue light and reflects red and green light. Yellow,

cyan, and magenta are the colors of primary pigments. A pigment that

absorbs two primary colors and reflects one color is called a 
secondarypigment.The colors of secondary pigments are red (which absorbs greenand blue light), green (which absorbs red and blue light), and blue (which
absorbs red and green light). Note that the primary pigment colors are the
secondary colors. In the same way, the secondary pigment colors are the

primary colors.
aColor by 
Temperature
Some artists refer to red and
orange as hot colors and green
and blue as cool colors. Do colors
really relate to temperature in 
this way?1.Obtain a glass prism from your
teacher.

2.Obtain a lamp with a dimmer
switch from your teacher. Turn on
the lamp and turn off the room

brightness of the lamp.
3.Slowly increase the brightness
of the lamp. CAUTION: Lamp

The Sun can
appear to be a shade of yellow ororange because of the scattering

of violet and blue light.Figure 16-14
The primary
pigments are magenta, cyan, and

yellow. Mixing these in pairs

produces the secondary pigments:
red, green, and blue.The primary and secondary pigments are shown in 
Figure 16-14.Whenthe primary pigments yellow and cyan are mixed, the yellow absorbs blue
light and the cyan absorbs red light. Thus, Figure 16-14 shows yellow and

cyan combining to make green pigment. When yellow pigment is mixed

with the secondary pigment, blue, which absorbs green and red light, all

of the primary colors are absorbed, so the result is black. Thus, yellow and

blue are complementary pigments. Cyan and red, as well as magenta and

green, are also complementary pigments.
A color printer uses yellow, magenta, and cyan dots of pigment to make
a color image on paper. Often, pigments that are used are finely ground

compounds, such as titanium(IV) oxide (white), chromium(III) oxide

(green), and cadmium sulfide (yellow). Pigments mix to form suspensions

rather than solutions. Their chemical form is not changed in a mixture, so

they still absorb and reflect the same wavelengths. 
Results in colorYou can now begin to understand the colors that you see
in the photo at the beginning of this chapter. The plants on the hillside look
green because of the chlorophyll in them. One type of chlorophyll absorbs

red light and the other absorbs blue light, but they both reflect green light.
The energy in the red and blue light that is absorbed is used by the plants

for photosynthesis, which is the process by which green plants make food. 
In the same photo, the sky is bluish. Violet and blue light are scattered(repeatedly reflected) much more by molecules in the air than are other

wavelengths of light. Green and red light are not scattered much by the air,

which is why the Sun looks yellow or orange, as shown in 
Figure 16-15.However, violet and blue light from the Sun are scattered in all directions,

illuminating the sky in a bluish hue.

Have you ever looked at light reflected off a road through polarizing
sunglasses? As you rotate the glasses, the road first appears to be dark, then
light, and then dark again. Light from a lamp, however, changes very little

as the glasses are rotated. Why is there a difference? Normal lamplight is

not polarized. However, the light that is coming from the road is reflected

and has become polarized. Polarization 
is the production of light in asingle plane of oscillation.Polarization by filtering
Polarization can be understood by considering a
rope model of light waves, as shown in 
Figure 16-16.The transverse
mechanical waves in the rope represent transverse light waves. The slot rep-
resents what is referred to as the polarizing axis of a polarizing medium.
When the rope waves are parallel to the slot, they pass through. When they

are perpendicular to the slot, the waves are blocked. Polarizing media con-

tain long molecules in which electrons can oscillate, or move back and forth,

all in the same direction. As light travels past the molecules, the electrons

can absorb light waves that oscillate in the same direction as the electrons.

This process allows light waves vibrating in one direction to pass through,

while the waves vibrating in the other direction are absorbed. The direction

of a polarizing medium perpendicular to the long molecules is called the
polarizing axis. Only waves oscillating parallel to that axis can pass through. 
Ordinary light actually contains waves vibrating in every direction 
perpendicular to its direction of travel. If a polarizing medium is placed in

a beam of ordinary light, only the components of the waves in the same

direction as the polarizing axis can pass through. On average, half of the

total light amplitude passes through, thereby reducing the intensity of the

light by half. The polarizing medium produces light that is polarized. Such

a medium is called a polarizing filter.
Polarization by reflection
When you look through a polarizing filter at
the light reflected by a sheet of glass and rotate the filter, you will see the
light brighten and dim. The light is partially polarized along the plane of
the glass when it is reflected. That is, the reflected ray contains a great deal

of light vibrating parallel to the surface of the glass. The polarization of

light reflected by roads is the reason why polarizing sunglasses reduce

glare. The fact that the intensity of light reflected off a road varies as polar-

izing sunglasses are rotated suggests that the reflected light is partially
polarized. Photographers can use polarizing filters over camera lenses to

block reflected light, as shown in 
Figure 16-17.Figure 16-16
In this rope modelof light, light is a single wave
oriented in relation to the vertical

plane and thus passes through 

a vertical polarizer

pass through a horizontal
polarizer (b).abSection 16.2The Wave Nature of Light

cross-polarized filters, such that its polarizing
axis is not parallel to either of the two filters, 
as shown in the figure to the right.1.You observe that some light passes through 
filter 2, though no light passed through filter 2
previous to inserting the analyzer filter. Why does

this happen?2.The analyzer filter is placed at an angle of 
relative to the polarizing axes of filter 1. Derive an

equation for the intensity of light coming out of
filter 2 compared to the intensity of light coming
out of filter 1.Polarization analysis
Suppose that you produce polarized light with a
polarizing filter. What would happen if you place a second polarizing fil-
ter in the path of the polarized light? If the polarizing axis of the second
filter is parallel to that of the first, the light will pass through, as shown in

Figure 16-18a.If the polarizing axis of the second filter is perpendicularto that of the first, no light will pass through, as shown in 
Figure 16-18b.
The law that explains the reduction of light intensity as it passes through
a second polarizing filter is called MalusÕs law.
If the light intensity afterthe first polarizing filter is I1, then a second polarizing filter, with its polar-
izing axis at an angle, 
, relative to the polarizing axis of the first, will result
in a light intensity, 
I2, that is equal to or less than I1. Using MalusÕs law, you can compare the light intensity coming out of
the second polarizing filter to the light intensity coming out of the first
polarizing filter, and thereby determine the orientation of the polarizing

axis of the first filter relative to the second filter. A polarizing filter that uses

MalusÕs law to accomplish this is called an analyzer. Analyzers can be used

to determine the polarization of light coming from any source.
MalusÕs Law
I2I1cos2The intensity of light coming out of a second polarizing filter is equal to the
intensity of polarized light coming out of a first polarizing filter multiplied by
the cosine, squared, of the angle between the polarizing axes of the two filters.

445The Speed of a Light Wave
As you learned in Chapter 14, the wavelength, 
, of a wave is a function
of its speed in the medium in which it is traveling and its constant fre-
quency, 
f. Because light has wave properties, the same mathematical mod-
els used to describe waves in general can be used to describe light. For light

of a given frequency traveling through a vacuum, wavelength is a function

of the speed of light, c, which can be written as 0c/f. The development
of the laser in the 1960s provided new methods of measuring the speed of

light. The frequency of light can be counted with extreme precision using
lasers and the time standard provided by atomic clocks. Measurements of

wavelengths of light, however, are much less precise.
Different colors of light have different frequencies and wavelengths, but
in a vacuum, they all travel at 
c. Because all wavelengths of light travel at
the same speed in a vacuum, when you know the frequency of a light wave

in a vacuum, you can calculate its wavelength, and vice versa. Thus, using

precise measurements of light frequency and light speed, you can calculate

a precise value of light wavelength.
Relative motion and light
What happens if a source of light is traveling
toward you or you are moving toward the light source? You learned in
Chapter 15 that the frequency of a sound heard by the listener changes if

either the source or the listener of the sound is moving. The same is true

for light. However, when you consider the velocities of a source of sound

and the observer, you are really considering each oneÕs velocity relative to

the medium through which the sound travels. 
Because light waves are not vibrations of the particles of a mechanical
medium, unlike sound waves, the Doppler effect of light can involve only

the velocities of the source and the observer relative to each other. The

magnitude of the difference between the velocities of the source and

observer is called the relative speed. Remember that the only factors in the

Doppler effect are the velocity components along the axis between the

source and observer, as shown in 
Figure 16-19.abFigure 16-19
The observer and
the light source have differentvelocities 
(a).The magnitude of
the vector subtraction of the
velocity components along the axis

between the source of light andthe observer of the light is referred
to as the relative speed along the
axis between the source and
observer, 
v(b).(Illustration not to scale)
439-447 CH16-S2-845813  6/4/04  10:35 AM  Page 445The Doppler effect
To study the Doppler effect for light, the problem can
be simplified by considering axial relative speeds that are much less than
the speed of light (vc). This simplification is used to develop the equa-
tion for the obseved light frequency, 
fobs, which is the frequency of light asseen by an observer. 
Because most observations of the Doppler effect for light have been
made in the context of astronomy, the equation for the Doppler effect for

light generally is written in terms of wavelength rather than frequency.

Using the relationship c/fand the vcsimplification, the following
equation can be used for the Doppler shift,, which is the differencebetween the observed wavelength of light and the actual wavelength.
A positive change in wavelength means that the light is red-shifted. This
occurs when the relative velocity of the source is in a direction away from

the observer. A negative change in wavelength means that the light is blue-

shifted. This occurs when the relative velocity of the source is in a direction

toward the observer. When the wavelength is red-shifted (lengthens), the

observed frequency is lower as a result of the inverse relationship between

the two variables, because the speed of light remains constant. When the

wavelength is blue-shifted, the observed frequency is higher. 
Researchers can determine how astronomical objects, such as galaxies,
are moving relative to Earth by observing the Doppler shift of light. This is

done by observing the spectrum of light coming from stars in the galaxy

using a spectrometer, as shown in 
Figure 16-20.
Elements that are presentin the stars of galaxies emit specific wavelengths in the lab. A spectrometer

is able to measure the Doppler shift of these wavelengths.
Doppler Shift(obs) vcThe difference between the observed wavelength of light and the actual
wavelength of light generated by a source is equal to the actual wavelength
of light generated by the source, times the relative speed of the source and

observer, divided by the speed of light. This quantity is positive if they are

moving away from each other or negative if they are moving toward each other.
Observed Light Frequency
fobsf(1vc)The observed frequency of light from a source is equal to the actual frequency

of the light generated by the source, times the quantity 1 plus the relative

speed along the axis between the source and the observer if they are moving
toward each other, or 1 minus the relative speed if they are moving away from

each other.

In 1929, Edwin Hubble suggested that the universe is expanding.
Hubble reached his conclusion of the expanding universe by analyzing
emission spectra from many galaxies. Hubble noticed that the spectral

lines of familiar elements were at longer wavelengths than expected. The

lines were shifted toward the red end of the spectrum. No matter what area

of the skies he observed, the galaxies were sending red-shifted light to

Earth. What do you think caused the spectral lines to be red-shifted?

Hubble concluded that all galaxies are moving away from Earth.
You have learned that some characteristics of light can be explained with

A light source that produces transverse light waves that are all in the same fixed
plane is said to be polarized in that plane. A polarizing filter can be used to find

light sources that produce polarized light. Some media can rotate the plane of
polarization of light as it transmits the light. Such media are said to be optically
active. In this activity, you will investigate these concepts of polarized light.

Advances In Lighting
Advances In Lighting
History has recordedthe use of oil, can-dles, and gas to provide illumination in the 
dark hours of the night. However, there has

always been inherent danger with the use of

open flames to provide light. The invention 

of electric lighting in the
nineteenth century pro-
vided brighter light and
improved safety to the 

public.The original form ofelectric light, which is still
in common use, is the

incandescent bulb. A

tungsten filament is
heated by electricity until

it glows white. The tung-

sten does not burn, but it
vaporizes, which eventu-

ally breaks the filament.
Because the light is a result
of heating the tungsten,
this is not very efficient.

Recent pursuits in electric

lighting have produced

longer-lasting, lower-heat

light sources.
Quartz-HalogenLampsTo prevent a 
filament from breaking, the bulb can be madevery small and filled with bromine or iodine

gas. Tungsten ions from the filament combine

with the gas molecules in the cooler parts of
the lamp to make a compound, which circu-
lates through the lamp and recombines with
the filament. The light is very white and bright,

but it also is very hot. An ordinary glass bulb

would melt, so fused quartz, which has a very

high melting point, is used.Gas-Discharge LampsThis type of lamp ismade of a glass tube with a wire electrode sealed
into each end. All of the air is extracted and
replaced by a very small amount of a specially

chosen gas. A high voltage is applied across the

electrodes. The electricity ionizes, or strips, some

electrons from the gas atoms. An ionized gas is a

good conductor, so electric current flows through

it, causing the gas to glow brightly. 
The use of a gas-discharge lamp dependsupon the type of gas: neon for advertising,

xenon for searchlights and camera flashes, and

sodium vapor for streetlights. Each type of gas

produces a different color, but the construction

of each lamp is very similar.
Fluorescent LampsTheglow produced by mercury

vapor is almost invisible

because most of its spec-
trum is in the ultraviolet

region, which is not visible.

A fluorescent lamp is made
by painting the inside of a

mercury-discharge lamp
with phosphor, a chemical
that glows brightly when

ultraviolet light strikes it.

Fluorescent lights can be
made in any color by

changing the mixture of
red, green, and blue phos-
phors. They have a long life

and are economical to use,

because they produce little
heat and a great deal of light.Light-Emitting DiodesThe light of the future may be the white light-

emitting diode, or LED. The LED produces

white light by illuminating a tiny phosphor

screen inside the LED with blue light. LEDs are
bright enough to read by and produce almost

no heat as they operate. They are so efficient

that a car battery could power the lamps in a

home for days without being recharged.

devices that use lights. Examine some

technology are used. 2.Research

Key Concepts
¥Light travels in a straight line through any uniform medium.
¥Materials can be characterized as being transparent, translucent, or opaque,
depending on the amount of light that they reflect, transmit, or absorb. 
¥The luminous flux of a light source is the rate at which light is emitted. 
It is measured in lumens (lm). ¥Illuminance is the luminous flux per unit area. It is measured in lux (lx), 
or lumens per square meter (lm/m2).¥For a point source, illuminance follows an inverse-square relationship 

with distance and a direct relationship with luminous flux.¥In a vacuum, light has a constant speed of 
c3.00108m/s.
E4Pr2Key Concepts
¥Light can have wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm.
¥White light is a combination of the spectrum of colors, each color having 

a different wavelength.
¥Combining the primary colors, red, blue, and green, forms white light.

Combinations of two primary colors form the secondary colors, yellow,

cyan, and magenta.
¥The primary pigments, cyan, magenta, and yellow, are used in combinations

of two to produce the secondary pigments, red, blue, and green.
¥Polarized light consists of waves oscillating in the same plane.
¥When two polarizing filters are used to polarize light, the intensity of the

light coming out of the last filter is dependent on the angle between the

polarizing axes of the two filters.
¥Light waves traveling through a vacuum can be characterized in terms of

frequency, wavelength, and the speed of light.
¥Light waves are Doppler shifted based upon the relative speed along the axis

of the observer and the source of light.

Undoubtedly, as long as there have been humans, they have seen their

faces reflected in the quiet water of lakes and ponds. When you look
at the surface of a body of water, however, you donÕt always see a clear

reflection. Sometimes, the wind causes ripples in the water, and passing

boats create waves. Disturbances on the surface of the water prevent the

light from reflecting in a manner such that a clear reflection is visible.
Almost 4000 years ago, Egyptians understood that reflection requires
smooth surfaces. They used polished metal mirrors to view their images.

Sharp, well-defined, reflected images were not possible until 1857, however,

when Jean Foucault, a French scientist, developed a method of coating

glass with silver. Modern mirrors are produced using ever-increasing preci-

sion. They are made with greater reflecting ability by the evaporation of 

aluminum or silver onto highly polished glass. The quality of reflecting

surfaces is even more important in applications such as lasers and 

telescopes. More than ever before, clear reflections in modern, optical

instruments require smooth surfaces.

The Law of Reflection
What happens to the light that is striking this book? When you hold the
book up to the light, you will see that no light passes through it. Recall
from Chapter 16 that an object like this is called opaque. Part of the light

is absorbed, and part is reflected. The absorbed light spreads out as ther-
mal energy. The behavior of the reflected light depends on the type of sur-

face and the angle at which the light strikes the surface.
Recall from Chapter 14 that when a wave traveling in two dimensions
encounters a barrier, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflec-

tion of the wave. 
This same two-dimensional reflection relationship
applies to light waves. Consider what happens when you bounce-pass a

basketball. The ball bounces in a straight line, as viewed from above, to the

other player. Light reflects in 
the same way as a basketball. 
Figure 17-1shows a ray of light striking a reflecting surface. The normal is an imaginary

line that is perpendicular to a surface at the location where light strikes the
surface.The 
reflected ray, the incident ray,
 and the normal to the surfacealways will be in the same plane. Although the light is traveling in 
threedimensions, the reflection of the light is planar (two-dimensional). The pla-

nar and angle relationships are known together as the law of reflection.
This law can be explained in terms of the wave model of light. 
Figure17-2shows a wave front of light approaching a reflective surface. As each
point along the wave front reaches the surface, it reflects off at the same

angle as the preceding point. Because all points are traveling at the same

speed, they alltravel 
the same total distance in the same time. Thus, the
wave 
front as a whole leaves the surface at an angle equal to its incident
angle. Note that the wavelength of the light does not affect this process.

Red, green, and blue light all follow this law.
Law of Reflection
riThe angle that a reflected ray makes as measured from the normal to a
reflective surface equals the angle that the incident ray makes as measured

from the same normal.
¥Light rays and wave fronts
are red.
¥Mirrors are 
light blue.Figure 17-2
A wave front of light approaches a reflective surface. Point P on the wave
front strikes the surface first 
(a).Point Q strikes the surface after point P reflects at an
angle equal to the incident angle (b).The process continues with all points reflecting 
off at angles equal to their incident angles, resulting in a reflected wave front

When a beam 
of light strikes a mirrored surface
(a),the parallel rays in the beamreflect in parallel and maintain 

the light as a beam (b).When the
light beam strikes a rough surface

(c),the parallel rays that make up the beam are reflected from
different microscopic surfaces,
thereby diffusing the beam (d).Smooth and rough surfaces
Consider the beam of light shown in 
Figure17-3a.All of the rays in this beam of light reflect off the surface parallel to
one another, as shown in 
Figure 17-3b.
This occurs only if the reflectingsurface is not rough on the scale of the wavelength of light. Such a surface

is considered to be smooth relative to the light. A smooth surface, such as

a mirror, causes 
specular reflection,in which parallel light rays are
reflected in parallel.What happens when light strikes a surface that appears to be smooth,but actually is rough on the scale of the wavelength of light, such as the

page of this textbook or a white wall? Is light reflected? How could you

demonstrate this? Figure 17-3cshows a beam of light reflecting off a sheet
of paper, which has a rough surface. All of the light rays that make up the

beam are parallel before striking the surface, but the reflected rays are not

parallel, as shown in 
Figure 17-3d.This is diffuse reflection,the scatter-ing of light off a rough surface.
The law of reflection applies to both smooth and rough surfaces. For a
rough surface, the angle that each incident ray makes with the normal

equals the angle that its reflected ray makes with the normal. However, on

a microscopic scale, the normals to the surface locations where the rays

strike are not parallel. Thus, the reflected rays cannot be parallel. The rough

surface prevents them from being parallel. In this case, a reflected beam

cannot be seen because the reflected rays are scattered in different directions.
With specular reflection, as with a mirror, you can see your face. But no
matter how much light is reflected off a wall or a sheet of paper, you will

never be able to use them as mirrors.

Section 17.1Reflection from Plane Mirrors
461Objects and Plane-Mirror Images
If you looked at yourself in a mirror this morning you saw your reflection
in a plane mirror. A 
plane mirroris a flat, smooth surface from whichlight is reflected by specular reflection. To understand reflection from a

mirror, you must consider the object of the reflection and the type of

image that is formed. In Chapter 16, the word 
objectwas used to refer to
sources of light. In describing mirrors, the word 
objectis used in the sameway, but with a more specific application. An 
objectis a source of lightrays that are to be reflected by a mirrored surface. An object can be a 

luminous source, such as a lightbulb, or an illuminated source, such as 

a girl, as shown in 
Figure 17-4.Most objects that you will work with 
in this chapter are a source of light that diverges, or spreads out from 

the source. 
Consider a single point on the bird in Figure 17-5.Light reflects dif-fusely from the crest of the bird, the object point. What happens to the
light? Some of the light travels from the bird to the mirror and reflects.

What does the boy see? Some of the reflected light from the bird hits 

his eyes. Because his brain processes this information as if the light has

traveled a straight path, it seems to the boy as if the light had followed 

the dashed lines. The light seems to have come from a point behind the

mirror, the image point.
The boy in Figure 17-5 sees rays of light that come from many points 
on the bird. The combination of the image points produced by reflected

light rays forms the 
imageof the bird. It is a virtual image,
which is a typeof image formed by diverging light rays. A virtual image is always on the

opposite side of the mirror from the object. Images of real objects pro-
duced by plane mirrors are always virtual images.
Properties of Plane-Mirror Images
Looking at yourself in a mirror, you can see that your image appears to
be the same distance behind the mirror as you are in front of the mirror.

How could you test this? Place a ruler between you and the mirror. Where

does the image touch the ruler? You also see that your image is oriented as

you are, and it matches your size. This is where the expression 
mirror image
originates. If you move toward the mirror, your image moves toward the

mirror. If you move away, your image also moves away.
Figure 17-4
The lightbulb is 
a luminous source that produces
diverging light by shining in all
directions. The girl is an illuminated

source that produces diverging

light by the diffused reflection
from her body of light that comes
from the lightbulb.Laura Sifferlin

Light rays (two are shown) leave a point on the object. Some strike the
mirror and are reflected into the eye. Sight lines, drawn as dashed lines, extend from
the location on the mirror where the rays are reflected back to where they converge.
The image is located where the sight lines converge: 
dido.Image position and heightThe geometric model of Figure 17-6demon-strates why the distances are the same. Two rays from point O at the tip of

the candle strike the mirror at point P1and point P2, respectively. Both rays
are reflected according to the law of reflection. The reflected rays are

extended behind the mirror as sight lines, converging at point I, which is

the image of point O. Ray 1, which strikes the mirror at an angle of inci-

dence of 0°, is reflected back on itself, so the sight line is at 90
°to the mir-ror, just as ray 1. Ray 2 is also reflected at an angle equal to the angle of

incidence, so the sight line is at the same angle to the mirror as ray 2.
This geometric model reveals that
line segmentsO
P1andI
P1are cor-responding sides of two congruent triangles, OP
1P2and IP1P2. The posi-tion of the object with respect to the mirror, or the object position, 
do, hasa length equal to the lengthofO
P1. The apparent position of the image
with respect to the mirror, or the image position, 
di, has a length equal tothe length of IP1. Using the convention that image position is negative to

The image formed
in a plane mirror is the same size
as the object and is the same

distance behind the mirror as 

the object is in front. However,

when the boy blinks his right eye,the left eye of his image blinks.Image orientationA plane mirror produces an image with the same orientation as the object. If you are standing on your feet, a plane mirror

produces an image of you standing on your feet. If you are doing a head-

stand, the mirror shows you doing a headstand. However, there is a differ-

ence between you and the appearance of y
our image in a mirror. Follow 
the sight lines in Figure 17-7.The ray that diverges from the right hand of
the boy converges at what appears to be the left hand of his image. Left and

right appear to be reversed by a plane mirror. Why, then, are top and bot-

tom not also reversed? This does not happen because a plane mirror does

not really reverse left and right. The mirror in Figure 17-7 only reverses the

boyÕs image such that it is facing in the opposite direction as the boy, or,

in other words, it produces a front-to-back reversal. 
Consider the image of the mountain in the photo at the beginning ofthe chapter. In this case, the image of the mountain can be described as

upside down, but the image is actually a front-to-back reversal of your view

of the actual mountain. Because the mirror (the lake surface) is horizon-
tal, rather than vertical, your perspective, or angle of view, makes the image

look upside down. Turn your book 90
°counterclockwise and look atFigure 17-7 again. The actual boy is now facing down, and his image is 

facing up, upside down relative to the actual boy, just like the image of the

mountain. The only thing that has changed is your perspective.

The focal point 
of a spherical concave mirror 
is located halfway between the

center of curvature and the mirror
surface. Rays entering parallel 

to the principal axis are reflectedto converge at the focal point, F.
If you look at the surface of a shiny spoon, you will notice that your 
reflection is different from what you see in a plane mirror. The spoon
acts as a curved mirror, with one side curved inward and the other curved

outward. The properties of curved mirrors and the images that they form

depend on the shape of the mirror and the objectÕs position.
Concave Mirrors
The inside surface of a shiny spoon, the side that holds food, acts as a
concave mirror. A 
concave mirror
has a reflective surface, the edges of
which curve toward the observer. Properties of a concave mirror depend on

how much it is curved. 
Figure 17-8shows how a spherical concave mirror
works. In a spherical concave mirror, the mirror is shaped as if it were a 

section of a hollow sphere with an inner reflective surface. The mirror has
the same geometric center, C, and radius of curvature, 
r, as a sphere ofradius, 
r. The line that includes line segment CM is the principal axis,
which is the straight line perpendicular to the surface of the mirror that
divides the mirror in half. Point M is the center of the mirror where the

principal axis intersects the mirror.
When you point the principal axis of a concave mirror toward the Sun,
all the rays are reflected through a single point. You can locate this point

by moving a sheet of paper toward and away from the mirror until the

smallest and sharpest spot of sunlight is focused on the paper. This spot is

called the focal pointof the mirror, the point where incident light rays
that are parallel to the principal axis converge after reflecting from the mirror.

The Sun is a source of parallel light rays because it is very far away. All of

the light that comes directly from the Sun must follow almost parallel

paths to Earth, just as all of the arrows shot by an archer must follow

almost parallel paths to hit within the circle of a bullÕs-eye.
When a ray strikes a mirror, it is reflected according to the law of 
reflection. Figure 17-8 shows that a ray parallel to the principal axis is

reflected and crosses the principal axis at point F, the focal point. F is at the

halfway point between M and C. The 
focal length,f, is the position of the focal point with respect to the mirror along the principal axis and can
be expressed as fr/2. The focal length is positive for a concave mirror.

(b).ababcGraphical Method of Finding the Image
You have already drawn rays to follow the path of light that reflects off
plane mirrors. This method is even more useful when applied to curved mir-
rors. Not only can the location of the image vary, but so can the orientation

and size of the image. You can use a ray diagram to determine properties of

an image formed by a curved mirror. 
Figure 17-9shows the formation of a
real image,
an image that is formed by the converging of light r
ays. The
image is inverted and larger than the object. The rays actually converge at

the point where the image is located. The point of intersection, I, of 
the two reflected rays determines the position of the image. You can see the

image floating in space if you place your eye so that the rays that form the

image fall on your eye, as in 
Figure 17-9a.As Figure 17-9bshows, how-
ever, your eye must be oriented so as to see the rays coming from the image

location. You cannot look at the image from behind. If you were to place

a movie screen at this point, the image would appear on the screen, as

shown in 
Figure 17-9c.You cannot do this with virtual images.
To more easily understand how ray tracing works with curved mirrors,
you can use simple, one-dimensional objects, such as the arrow shown in

Figure 17-10a.
A spherical concave mirror produces an inverted real image
if the object position, do, is greater than twice the focal length, f. The objectis then beyond the center of curvature, C. If the object is placed between 

the center of curvature and the focal point, F, as shown in 
Figure 17-10b,
the image is again real and inverted. However, the size of the image is now

greater than the size of the object.Section 17.2Curved Mirrors

Use the following strategies for spherical-mirror problems. Refer to Figure 17-10.
1.Using lined or graph paper, draw the principal axis of the mirror as a horizontal
line from the left side to the right side of your paper, leaving six blank lines above

and six blank lines below.
2.Place a point and a label on the principal axis the object, C, and F, as follows.
a.If the mirror is a concave mirror and the object is beyond C, away from the mirror,
place the mirror at the right side of the page, place the object at the left side of
the page, and place C and F to scale.
b.If the mirror is a concave mirror and the object is between C and F, place the

mirror at the right side of the page, place C at the center of the paper, F halfway

between the mirror and C, and the object to scale.
c.For any other situation, place the mirror in the center of the page. Place the object

or F (whichever is the greatest distance from the mirror) at the left side of the

page, and place the other to scale.
3.To represent the mirror, draw a vertical line at the mirror point that extends the
full 12 lines of space. This is the principal plane.
4.Draw the object as an arrow and label its top O
1. For concave mirrors, objects
inside of C should not be higher than three lines high. For all other situations, 

the objects should be six lines high. The scale for the height of the object will be

different from the scale along the principal axis.
5.Draw ray 1, the parallel ray. It is parallel to the principal axis and reflects off the

principal plane and passes through F.
6.Draw ray 2, the focus ray. It passes through F, reflects off the principal plane, and

is reflected parallel to the principal axis.7.The image is located where rays 1 and 2 (or their sight lines) cross after reflection.

Label the point I
1. The image is an arrow perpendicular from the principal axis to I
1.How can the inverted real image created by a concave mirror be turned
right-side up? In 1663, Scottish astronomer James Gregory developed the
Gregorian telescope, shown in 
Figure 17-11,
to resolve this problem. It is
composed of a large concave mirror and a small concave mirror arranged

such that the smaller mirror is outside of the focal point of the larger 
mirror. Parallel rays of light from distant objects strike the larger mirror

and reflect toward the smaller mirror. The rays then reflect off the smaller

mirror and form a real image that is oriented exactly as the object is.

A concave
spherical mirror reflects some
rays, such that they converge at
points other than the focus 
(a).A parabolic mirror focuses all
parallel rays at a point (b).abSection 17.2Curved Mirrors
467Real image defects in concave mirrors
In tracing rays, you have
reflected the rays from the principal plane, which is a vertical line
representing the mirror. In reality, rays are reflected off the mirror itself, as

shown in 
Figure 17-12a.Notice that only parallel rays that are close to the
principal axis, or paraxial rays, are reflected through the focal point. Other

rays converge at points closer to the mirror. The image formed by parallel

rays reflecting off a spherical mirror with a large mirror diameter and a

small radius of curvature is a disk, not a point. This effect, called 
spheri-cal aberration,makes an image look fuzzy, not sharp.
A mirror ground to the shape of a parabola, as in Figure 17-12b,
suf-fers no spherical aberration. Because of the cost of manufacturing large,

perfectly parabolic mirrors, many of the newest telescopes use spherical

mirrors and smaller, specially-designed secondary mirrors or lenses to 

correct for spherical aberration. Also, spherical aberration is reduced as 
the ratio of the mirrorÕs diameter, shown in Figure 17-12a, to its radius of

curvature is reduced. Thus, lower-cost spherical mirrors can be used in

lower-precision applications.
Mathematical Method of Locating the Image
The spherical mirror model can be used to develop a simple equation
for spherical mirrors. You must use the paraxial ray approximation, which

states that only rays that are close to and almost parallel with the principal

axis are used to form an image. Using this, in combination with the law of

reflection, leads to the mirror equation,relating the focal length, 
f, objectposition, do, and image position, di, of a spherical mirror.
When using this equation to solve problems, it is important to remem-
ber that it is only approximately correct. It does not predict spherical 
aberration, because it uses the paraxial ray approximation. In reality, light

coming from an object toward a mirror is diverging, so not all of the 

light is close to or parallel to the axis. When the mirror diameter is small

relative to the radius of curvature to minimize spherical aberration, this

equation predicts image properties more precisely.
Mirror Equation1fd1id1oThe reciprocal of the focal length of a spherical mirror is equal to the sum of
the reciprocals of the image position and the object position.

Adding and Subtracting Fractions
When using the mirror equation, 
you first use math to move the fraction that contains the quantity you 
are seeking to the left-hand side of the equation and everything else 

to the right. Then you combine the two fractions on the right-hand 

side using a common denominator that results from multiplying the

denominators.

didofdofdodifdiffdodidodiMagnificationAnother property of a spherical mirror is magnification,m, which is how much larger or smaller the image is relative to the object.
In practice, this is a simple ratio of the image height to the object height.
Using similar-triangle geometry, this ratio can be written in terms of image

positon and object position.Image position is positive for a real image when using the preceding
equations. Thus, the magnification is negative, which means that the

image is inverted compared to the object. If the object is beyond point C,

the absolute value of the magnification for the real image is less than 1.

This means that the image is smaller than the object. If the object is placed
between point C and point F, the absolute value of the magnification for

the real image is greater than 1. Thus, the image is larger than the object. 
MagnificationmhhoidodiThe magnification of an object by a spherical mirror, defined as the image
height divided by the object height, is equal to the negative of the image

from the mirror as the focal point. Prove your answer mathematically. Calculate the image height as

Virtual Images with Concave Mirrors
You have seen that as an object approaches the focal point, F, of a con-
cave mirror, the image moves farther away from the mirror. If the object is
at the focal point, all reflected rays are parallel. They never meet, therefore,

and the image is said to be at infinity, so the object could never be seen.

What happens if the object is moved even closer to the mirror?
What do you see when you move your face close to a concave mirror?
The image of your face is right-side up and behind the mirror. A concave

mirror produces a virtual image if the object is located between the mirror

and the focal point, as shown in the ray diagram in 
Figure 17-13a.Again,two rays are drawn to locate the image of a point on an object. As before,

ray 1 is drawn parallel to the principal axis and reflected through the 

focal point. Ray 2 is drawn as a line from the point on the object to the

mirror, along a line defined by the focal point and the point on the object.

At the mirror, ray 2 is reflected parallel to the principal axis. Note that 

ray 1 and ray 2 diverge as they leave the mirror, so there cannot be a real

image. However, sight lines extended behind the mirror converge, showing

that the virtual image forms behind the mirror.
When you use the mirror equation to solve problems involving concave
mirrors for which an object is between the mirror and the focal point, 

you will find that the image position is negative. The magnification equa-

tion gives a positive magnification greater than 1, which means that 

the image is upright and larger compared to the object, like the image in
Figure 17-13b.

A convex mirroralways produces virtual images

that are upright and smallercompared to the object.Convex Mirrors
In the first part of this chapter, you learned that the inner surface of a
shiny spoon acts as a concave mirror. If you turn the spoon around, the

outer surface acts as a convex mirror,
a reflective surface with edges that
curve away from the observer. What do you see when you look at the back

of a spoon? You see an upright, but smaller image of yourself.
Properties of a spherical convex mirror are shown in 
Figure 17-14.Rays
reflected from a convex mirror always diverge. Thus, convex mirrors form

virtual images. Points F and C are behind the mirror. In the mirror equation,

fand diare negative numbers because they are both behind the mirror.
The ray diagram in Figure 17-14 represents how an image is formed by
a spherical convex mirror. The figure uses two rays, but remember that

there are an infinite number of rays. Ray 1 approaches the mirror parallel

to the principal axis. The reflected ray is drawn along a sight line from F

through the point where ray 1 strikes the mirror. Ray 2 approaches the mir-

ror on a path that, if extended behind the mirror, would pass through F.

The reflected part of ray 2 and its sight line are parallel to the principal axis.

The two reflected rays diverge, and the sight lines intersect behind the mir-

ror at the location of the image. An image produced by a single convex mir-

ror is a virtual image that is upright and smaller compared to the object.The magnification equation is useful for determining the apparentdimensions of an object as seen in a spherical convex mirror. If you know

the diameter of an object, you can multiply by the magnification fraction

to see how the diameter changes. You will find that the diameter is smaller,

as are all other dimensions. This is why the objects appear to be farther

away 
than they actually are for convex mirrors.
Field of viewIt may seem that convex mirrors would have little use
because the images that they form are smaller than the objects. However,

this property of convex mirrors does have practical uses. By forming smaller

images, convex mirrors enlarge the area, or field of view, that an observer

sees, as shown in 
Figure 17-15.Also, the center of this field of view is visible from any angle of an observer off the principal axis of the mirror;

thus, the field of view is visible from a wide perspective. For this reason,

convex mirrors often are used in cars as passenger-side rearview mirrors.

object. A negative magnification means the image is inverted relative to the

object. Notice that the single plane mirror and convex mirror produce only

virtual images, whereas the concave mirror can produce real images or 

virtual images. Plane mirrors give simple reflections, and convex mirrors

expand the field of view. A concave mirror acts as a magnifier when an

object is within the focal length of the mirror.

A concave mirror reflects light rays that arrive parallel to the principal axis
through the focal point. Depending on the object position, different types of
images can be formed. Real images can be projected onto a screen while virtual

images cannot. In this experiment you will investigate how changing the object

position affects the image location and type.

Adaptive Optical Systems
Objects in spaceare difficult toobserve from Earth because they
twinkle. Our moving, unevenly-

heated atmosphere refracts their
light in a chaotic manner. ItÕs like

trying to look at a small object
through the bottom of an empty,

clear, glass jar while rotating the jar. 
Flexible Adaptive Mirror
An adaptive optical system (AOS)

continuously compensates for 
the distortion of the atmosphere,

removing the twinkle from star

images to allow astronomers to

view and photograph steady 
images of the most distant objects
in the visible universe.
An AOS directs the magnified
image of the stars from the telescope
onto a flexible adaptive mirror

made of thin glass. This mirror is

stretched across 20Ð30 movable

pistons that can poke or pull the
surface of the mirror into many

complicated shapes. Each piston is

driven by a fast, computer-controlled

motor. When the mirror surface is

shaped into just the right pattern at
just the right time, it will compen-

sate for the convective movement of the atmos-

phere between the telescope and the star, and

reflect a clear image to the observer or camera.
Wave-Front Sensor
To detect the atmos-
pheric distortion at each instant of time, a

wave-front sensor looks at a single star through

the telescope. This device has an array of tiny

lenses (lenslets) in several rows. Each lenslet

forms an image of the star on a sensitive screen

behind it. The position of each image can be
read by the computer. 
If each image is not directly behind its lenslet,then the computer knows that the starÕs light

waves are being distorted by the atmosphere. 

A star is a distant point source of light, so it
should produce plane waves. Distorted images

of a star are non-planar light waves, and these

uneven waves cause the images of the star

behind some of the lenslets to be displaced. The computer looks at this error and calcu-lates how the adaptive mirror should be 

wrinkled to bring each of the lenslet images
back into place. The star image reflected to the

observer then will be correct, and a clear image

of all other objects (like galaxies and planets) in
the vicinity also will be seen clearly. The adaptive

mirror is re-shaped about 1000 times per second.
AOS compensates for distortion when viewing Titan, SaturnÕs largest moon.

Key Concepts
¥According to the law of reflection, the angle that an incident ray makes with
the normal equals the angle that the reflected ray makes with the normal.
¥The law of reflection applies to both smooth and rough surfaces. A rough

surface, however, has normals that go in lots of different directions, which

means that parallel incident rays will not be reflected in parallel.
¥A smooth surface produces specular reflection. A rough surface produces
diffuse reflection.¥Specular reflection results in the formation of images that appear to be
behind plane mirrors.
¥An image produced by a plane mirror is always virtual, is the same size as 

the object, has the same orientation, and is the same distance from the
mirror as the object.didohihoriKey Concepts
¥You can locate the image created by a spherical mirror by drawing two rays

from a point on the object to the mirror. The intersection of the two

reflected rays is the image of the object point.
¥The mirror equation gives the relationship among image position, object

position, and focal length of a spherical mirror.
¥The magnification of a mirror image is given by equations relating either 

the positions or the heights of the image and the object.¥A single concave mirror produces a real image that is inverted when the

object position is greater than the focal length.¥A single concave mirror produces a virtual image that is upright when the

object position is less than the focal length.¥A single convex mirror always produces a virtual image that is upright and

smaller compared to the object.¥By forming smaller images, convex mirrors make images seem farther away

and produce a wide field of view.
¥Mirrors can be used in combinations to produce images of any size,

orientation, and location desired. The most common use of combinations 
of mirrors is as telescopes.

total internal reflection

dispersionLooking at the surface of a swimming pool on a summer day, you can

see sunlight reflecting off the water. You can see objects that are in the
pool because some of the sunlight travels into the water and reflects off the

objects. When you look closely at objects in the water, however, you will

notice that they look distorted. For example, things beneath the surface

look closer than normal, the feet of a person standing still in the pool
appear to move back and forth, and lines along the bottom of the pool

seem to sway with the movement of the water. These effects occur because

light changes direction as it passes from water to air.
As you learned in Chapter 16, the path of light is bent as it crosses the
boundary between two media due to refraction. The amount of refraction

depends on properties of the two media and on the angle at which the

light strikes the boundary. As waves travel along the surface of the water,

the boundary between the air and water moves up and down, and tilts

back and forth. The path of light leaving the water shifts as the boundary

moves, causing objects under the surface to appear to waver.

Snell’s Law of Refraction
What happens when you shine a narrow beam of light at the surface of
a piece of glass? As you can see in 
Figure 18-1,it bends as it crosses theboundary from air to glass. The bending of light, called refraction, was first
studied by Ren” Descartes and Willebrord Snell around the time of Kepler

and Galileo.To discuss the results of Descartes and Snell, you have to define two
angles. The angle of incidence, 
1, is the angle at which the light ray strikes
the surface. It is measured from the normal to the surface. The angle of

refraction, 2, is the angle at which the transmitted light leaves the surface.
It also is measured with respect to the normal. In 1621, Snell found that

when light passed from air into a transparent substance, the sines of the

angles were related by the equation sin 
1/sin 
2n. Here nis a constantthat depends on the substance, not on the angles, and is called the 
indexof refraction.The indices of refraction for some substances are listed inTable 18-1.
The relationship found by Snell is valid when light goes across
a boundary between any two materials. This more general equation is

known as 
SnellÕs law of refraction.
Figure 18-1 shows how SnellÕs law applies when light travels through a
piece of glass with parallel surfaces, such as a windowpane. The light is

refracted both when it enters the glass and again when it leaves the glass.

When light goes from air to glass it moves from material with a lower

index of refraction to one with a higher index of refraction. That is, 
n1n2.To keep the two sides of the equation equal, one must have sin 
1sin 2.The light beam is bent toward the normal to the surface.
When light travels from glass to air it moves from material having a
higher index of refraction to one with a lower index. In this case, 
n1n2.To keep the two sides of the equation equal one must have sin 
1sin 2.That is, the light is bent away from the normal. Note that the direction of

the ray when it leaves the glass is the same as it was before it struck the

glass, but it is shifted from its original position.

eclipse. A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth blocks sunlight from the Moon.
As a result, you might expect the Moon to be completely dark. Instead,

light refracts through EarthÕs atmosphere and bends around Earth toward

the Moon. Recall that EarthÕs atmosphere scatters most of the blue and

green light. Thus, mostly red light illuminates the Moon. Because the

Moon reflects most colors of light equally well, it reflects the red light back

to Earth, and therefore the Moon appears to be red. Astronomy ConnectionAstronomy ConnectionMath HandbookInverses of Sine, Cosine, and Tangent

Wave Model of Refraction
The wave model of light was developed almost 200 years after Snell
published his research. An understanding that light interacts with atomswhen traveling through a medium, such that it moves more slowly than in

a vacuum, was achieved three hundred years after SnellÕs work. The wave

relationship that you learned in Chapter 16 for light traveling through a

vacuum, 
0c/f, can be rewritten as v/f, where vis the speed of lightin any medium and 
is the wavelength. The frequency of light, 
f, does notchange when it crosses a boundary. That is, the number of oscillations per

second that arrive at a boundary is the same as the number that leave the

boundary and transmit through the refracting medium. So, the wavelength

of light, , must decrease when light slows down. Wavelength in a medium
is shorter than wavelength in a vacuum.
What happens when light travels from a region with a high speed into
one with a low speed, as shown in 
Figure 18-2a?The diagram in Figure18-2bshows a beam of light as being made up of a series of parallel,
straight wave fronts. Each wave front represents the crest of a wave and is

perpendicular to the direction of the beam. The beam strikes the surface at
an angle, 
1. Consider the triangle PQR. Because the wave fronts are 
perpendicular to the direction of the beam, PQR is a right angle andQRP is equal to 1. Therefore, sin 
1is equal to the distance between P
and Q divided by the distance between P and R.
sin 1PPQRThe angle of refraction, 2, can be related in a similar way to the triangle
PSR. In this casesin 2PRRSBy taking the ratio of the sines of the two angles, P

Using the transitive property of equality, the previous
two equations lead to the following equation:
nn12vv21In a vacuum, 
n1 and vc. If either medium is a vacuum, then the
equation is simplified to an equation that relates the index of refraction tothe speed of light in a medium.This definition of the index of refraction can be used to find the wave-
length of light in a medium compared to the wavelength the light would

have in a vacuum. In a medium with an index of refraction n, the speedof light is given by v  c/n. The wavelength of the light in a vacuum is 0c/f. Solve for frequency, and substitute 
fc/0and vc/ninto v/f. (c/n)/(c/0) 0/n, and thus the wavelength of light in a
medium is smaller than the wavelength in a vacuum.
Total Internal Reflection
The angle of refraction is larger than the angle of incidence when lightpasses into a medium of a lower index of refraction, as shown in 
Figure18-3a.This leads to an interesting phenomenon. As the angle of incidenceincreases, the angle of refraction increases. At a certain angle of incidence

known as the 
critical angle,
c, the refracted light ray lies along the
boundary of the two media, as shown in 
Figure 18-3b.
Recall from Chapter 16 that when light strikes a transparent boundary,
even though much of the light is transmitted, some is reflected. 
Total
internal reflectionoccurs when light traveling from a region of a higher
index of refraction to a region of a lower index of refraction strikes the

boundary at an angle greater than the critical angle such that all light
reflects back into the region of the higher index of refraction, as shown in

Figure 18-3c.To construct an equation for the critical angle of any bound-
ary, you can use SnellÕs law and substitute 
1cand 290.0
°.Total internal reflection causes some curious effects. Suppose that you are
looking up at the surface from underwater in a calm pool. You might see an

upside-down reflection of another nearby object that also is underwater or

a reflection of the bottom of the pool itself. The surface of the water acts

like a mirror. Likewise, when you are standing on the side of a pool, it is

possible for things below the surface of the water to not be visible to you.

When a swimmer is underwater, near the surface, and on the opposite side

of the pool from you, you might not see him or her. This is because the

light from his or her body is reflected.Critical Angle for Total Internal Reflection

Figure 18-4,the light traveling through the trans-
parent fiber always hits the internal boundary of the optical fiber at an
angle greater than the critical angle, so all of the light is reflected and none

of the light is transmitted through the boundary. Thus, the light maintains

its intensity over the distance of the fiber. 
Mirages
On a hot summer day, you sometimes can see the mirage effect shown
in Figure 18-5a.As you drive down a road, you see what appears to be 
the reflection of an oncoming car in a pool of water. The pool, however,

disappears as you approach it. The mirage is the result of the Sun heating

the road. The hot road heats the air above it and produces a thermal lay-

ering of air that causes light traveling toward the road to gradually bend

upward. This makes the light appear to be coming from a reflection in a

pool, as shown in 
Figure 18-5b.
Figure 18-5cshows how this occurs. As light from a distant object trav-
els downward toward the road, the index of refraction of the air decreases

as the air gets hotter, but the temperature change is gradual. Recall from

Chapter 16 that light wave fronts are comprised of HuygensÕ wavelets. In

the case of a mirage, the HuygensÕ wavelets closer to the ground travel

faster than those higher up, causing the wave 
fronts to gradually turnupward. A similar phenomenon, called a superior mirage, occurs when a

reflection of a distant boat appears above the boat. The water keeps the air
that is closer to its surface cooler.
Figure 18-4
Light impulses from
a source enter one end of the
optical fiber. Each time the light

strikes the surface, the angle of

incidence is larger than the
crictical angle, and, therefore, 
the light is kept within the fiber.
John M. Dunay IV/Fundamental Photographs 484-492 CH18-S1-845813  6/4/04  1:00 PM  Page 490Dispersion of Light
The speed of light in a medium is determined by interactions between
the light and the atoms that make up the medium. Recall from Chapters
12 and 13 that temperature and pressure are related to the energy of parti-
cles on the atomic level. The speed of light, and therefore, the index of

refraction for a gaseous medium, can change slightly with temperature. In

addition, the speed of light and the index of refraction vary for different

wavelengths of light in the same liquid or solid medium.
You learned in Chapter 16 that white light separates into a spectrum of
colors when it passes through a glass prism, as shown in 
Figure 18-6a.This phenomenon is called dispersion.If you look carefully at the light
that passes through a prism, you will notice that violet is refracted more

than red, as shown in 
Figure 18-6b.
This occurs because the speed of violet light through glass is less than the speed of red light through glass.

Violet light has a higher frequency than red light, which causes it to inter-
act differently with the atoms of the glass. This results in glass having a

slightly higher index of refraction for violet light than it has for red light.RainbowsA prism is not the only means of dispersing light. A rainbow 
is a spectrum formed when sunlight is dispersed by water droplets in the
atmosphere. Sunlight that falls on a water droplet is refracted. Because of

dispersion, each color is refracted at a slightly different angle, as shown in

Figure 18-7a.At the back surface of the droplet, some of the light under-
goes internal reflection. On the way out of the droplet, the light once again

is refracted and dispersed.Although each droplet produces a complete spectrum, an observer posi-
tioned between the Sun and the rain will see only a certain wavelength of

light from each droplet. The wavelength depends on the relative positions of
the Sun, the droplet, and the observer, as shown in 
Figure 18-7b.
Becausethere are many droplets in the sky, a complete spectrum is visible. The

droplets reflecting red light make an angle of 42°in relation to the directionof the SunÕs rays; the droplets 
reflecting blue light make an angle of 40°.Section 18.1Refraction of Light

A convex lenscauses rays of light to converge
(a).A concave lens causes rays 
of light to diverge (b).abThe refraction of light in nature that forms rainbows and red lunar
eclipses is beautiful, but refraction also is useful. In 1303, French
physician Bernard of Gordon wrote of the use of lenses to correct eyesight.

Around 1610, Galileo used two lenses to make a telescope, with which he

discovered the moons of Jupiter. Since GalileoÕs time, lenses have been

used in many instruments, such as microscopes and cameras. Lenses are

probably the most useful of all optical devices.
Types of Lenses
A lensis a piece of transparent material, such as glass or plastic, that isused to focus light and form an image. Each 
of a lensÕs two faces might be
either curved or flat. The lens in 
Figure 18-9ais called a 
convex lens
because it is thicker at the center than at the edges. A convex lens often is
called a converging lens because when surrounded by material with a

lower index of refraction it refracts parallel light rays so 
that the rays meet
at a point. The lens in Figure 18-9bis called a concave 
lensbecause it is thinner in the middle than at the edges. A concave lens often is called a

diverging lens because when surrounded by material with a lower index of

refraction rays passing through it spread out.
When light passes through a lens, refraction occurs at the two lens sur-
faces. Using SnellÕs law and geometry, you can predict the paths of rays

passing through lenses. To simplify such problems, assume that all refrac-

tion occurs on a plane, called the principal plane, that passes through the 

center of the lens. This approximation, called the thin lens model, applies

to all the lenses that you will learn about in this chapter section.
Lens equationsThe problems that you will solve involve spherical thin
lenses, lenses that have faces with the same curvature as a sphere. Based on
the thin lens model, as well as the other simplifications used in solving

problems for spherical mirrors, equations have been developed that look

exactly like the equations for spherical mirrors. The 
thin lens equationrelates the focal length of a spherical thin lens to the object position and the
image position. The magnification equation for spherical mirrors used in Chapter 17also can be used for spherical thin lenses. It is used to determine the height

and orientation of the image formed by a spherical thin lens.
MagnificationmhhoidodiThe magnification of an object by a spherical lens, defined as the image
height divided by the object height, is equal to the negative of the image
position divided by the object position.Thin Lens Equation1fd1id1oThe inverse of the focal length of a spherical lens is equal to the sum of the

inverses of the image position and the object position.

It is important that you use the proper

Table 18-2
shows a com-
parison of the image position, magnification, and type of image formed 
by single convex and concave lenses when an object is placed at various

object positions, 
do, relative to the lens. Notice the similarity of this table
to Table 17-1 for mirrors. As with mirrors, the distance from the principal

plane of a lens to its focal point is the focal length, f. The focal lengthdepends upon the shape of the lens and the index of refraction of the lens
material. Focal lengths and image positions can be negative.
For lenses, virtual images are always on the same side of the lens as the
object, which means that the image position is negative. When the

absolute value of a magnification is between zero and one, the image is

smaller than the object. Magnifications with absolute values greater than

one represent images that are larger than the objects. A negative magnifi-

cation means the image is inverted compared to the object. Notice that 

a concave lens produces only virtual images, whereas a convex lens can

produce real images or virtual images. 
Convex Lenses and Real Images
As shown in 
Figure 18-10a,
paper can be ignited by producing a real
image of the Sun on the paper. Recall from Chapter 17 that the rays of the

Sun are almost exactly parallel when they reach Earth. After being refractedby the lens, the rays converge at the focal point, F, of the lens. 
Figure 18-10b
shows two focal points, one on each side of the lens. You could turn
the lens around, and it will work the same.

In Figure 18-11,
rays are traced from an object located far
from a convex lens. For the purpose of locating the image, you only need
to use two rays. Ray 1 is parallel to the principal axis. It refracts and passes

through F on the other side of the lens. Ray 2 passes through F on its way

to the lens. After refraction, its path is parallel to the principal axis. The two

rays intersect at a point beyond F and locate the image. Rays selected from

other points on the object converge at corresponding points to form the

complete image. Note that this is a real image that is inverted and smaller

compared to the object.You can use Figure 18-11 to locate the image of an object that is closer
to the lens than the object in the figure. If a refracted ray is reversed in

direction, it will follow its original path in the reverse direction. This

means that the image and object may be interchanged by changing the

direction of the rays. Imagine that the path of light through the lens in

Figure 18-11 is reversed and the object is at a distance of 15 cm from the

right side of the lens. The new image, located 30 cm from the left side of

the lens, is a real image that is inverted and larger compared to the object.
If the object is placed at twice the focal length from the lens at the point2F, as shown in 
Figure 18-12,the image also is found at 2F. Because of
symmetry, the image and object have the same size. Thus, you can con-

clude that if an object is more than twice the focal length from the lens,

the image is smaller than the object. If the object is between F and 2F, then

the image is larger than the object.Lens Masking EffectsWhat happens when you mask, 
or cover, part of a lens? Does this

to be formed by the lens?1.Stick the edge of a convex lensinto a ball of clay and place thelens on a tabletop.

imageFFdidoFigure 18-13
The two principal
rays show that a convex lensforms a virtual image that is

upright and larger compared to
the object when the object is
located between the lens and 

the focal point. Because the

principal rays are simply part of 

a model to help locate an image,

they do not have to pass through
the picture of the lens in a
diagram. In reality, the image 

is formed only by the light thatpasses through the actual lens.
Convex Lenses and Virtual Images
When an object is placed at the focal point of a convex lens, the
refracted rays will emerge in a parallel beam and no image will be seen.

When the object is brought closer to the lens, the rays will diverge on the

opposite side of the lens, and the rays will appear to an observer to come

from a spot on the same side of the lens as the object. This is a virtual
image that is upright and larger compared to the object.Figure 18-13shows how a convex lens forms a virtual image. The object
is located between F and the lens. Ray 1, as usual, approaches the lens par-

allel to the principal axis and is refracted through the focal point, F. Ray 2

travels from the tip of the object, in the direction it would have if it had

started at F on the object side of the lens. The dashed line from F to the

object shows you how to draw ray 2. Ray 2 leaves the lens parallel to the

principal axis. Rays 1 and 2 diverge as they leave the lens. Thus, no real

image is possible. Drawing sight lines for the two rays back to their appar-

ent intersection locates the virtual image. It is on the same side of the lens

as the object, and it is upright and larger compared to the object. Note that
the actual image is formed by light that passes through the lens, but you

can still determine the location of the image by drawing rays that do not

have to pass through the lens.

497493-499 CH18-S2-845813  6/4/04  1:16 PM  Page 497498Chapter 18Refraction and Lenses
Concave Lenses
A concave lens causes all rays to diverge. 
Figure 18-14shows how such
a lens forms a virtual image. Ray 1 approaches the lens parallel to the prin-
cipal axis. It leaves the lens along a line that extends back through the focal

point. Ray 2 approaches the lens as if it is going to pass through the focal

point on the opposite side, and leaves the lens parallel to the principal

axis. The sight lines of rays 1 and 2 intersect on the same side of the lens

as the object. Because the rays diverge, they produce a virtual image. The

image is located at the point from where the two rays apparently diverge.

The image also is upright and smaller compared to the object. This is true
no matter how far from the lens the object is located. The focal length of a

concave lens is negative.
When solving problems for concave lenses using the thin lens equation,
you should remember that the sign convention for focal length is different

from that of convex lenses. If the focal point for a concave lens is 24 cm

from the lens, you should use the value 
f24 cm in the thin lens equa-tion. All images for a concave lens are virtual. Thus, if an image distance is

given as 20 cm from the lens, then you should use 
di20 cm. The object
position always will be positive.
Defects of Spherical Lenses
Throughout this section, you have studied lenses that produce perfect
images at specific positions. In reality, spherical lenses, just like spherical

mirrors, have intrinsic defects that cause problems with the focus and color

of images. Spherical lenses exhibit an aberration associated with their

spherical design, just as mirrors do. In addition, the dispersion of light
through a spherical lens causes an aberration that mirrors do not exhibit.Spherical aberration
The model that you have used for drawing rays
through spherical lenses suggests that all parallel rays focus at the same
position. However, this is only an 
approximation. In reality, parallel rays
that pass through the edges of a spherical lens focus at positions differentfrom those of parallel rays that pass through the center. This inability of a

spherical lens to focus all parallel rays
 to a single point is called sphericalaberration. Making lens surfaces aspherical, such as in cameras, eliminates
spherical aberration. In high-precision instruments, many lenses, often five

or more, are used to form sharp, well-defined images.

493-499 CH18-S2-845813  6/4/04  1:19 PM  Page 498Chromatic aberration
Lenses have a
second defect that mirrors do not have.
A lens is like a prism, so different wave-

lengths of light are refracted at slightly different angles, as you can see in

Figure 18-15a.Thus, the light that
passes through a lens, especially near

the edges, is slightly dispersed. An

object viewed through a lens appears

to be ringed with color. This effect is

called chromatic aberration.Theterm chromatic
comes from the Greekword 
chromo,
which means Òcolor.Ó
Chromatic aberration is always present when a single lens is used.
However, this defect can be greatly reduced by an 
achromatic lens,
whichis a system of two or more lenses, such as a convex lens with a concave lens,

that have different indices of refraction. Such a combination of lenses is

shown in 
Figure 18-15b.
Both lenses in the figure disperse light, but thedispersion caused by the convex lens is almost canceled by the dispersion

caused by the concave lens. The index of refraction of the convex lens is

chosen so that the combination of lenses still converges the light.

lenses are used in almost every optical instrument. In many cases, a
combination of lenses and mirrors is used to produce clear images of small
or faraway objects. Telescopes, binoculars, cameras, microscopes, and even

your eyes contain lenses.
Lenses in Eyes
The eye is a remarkable optical device. As shown in 
Figure 18-18,theeye is a fluid-filled, almost spherical vessel. Light that is emitted or

reflected off an object travels into the eye through the cornea. The light

then passes through the lens and focuses onto the retina that is at the back
of the eye. Specialized cells on the retina absorb this light and send infor-

mation about the image along the optic nerve to the brain.
Focusing images
Because of its name, you might assume that the lens of
an eye is responsible for focusing light onto the retina. In fact, light enter-
ing the eye is primarily focused by the cornea because the air-cornea 

surface has the greatest difference in indices of refraction. The lens is
responsible for the fine focus that allows you to clearly see both distant

and nearby objects. Using a process called accommodation, muscles 

surrounding the lens can contract or relax, thereby changing the shape of

the lens. This, in turn, changes the focal length of the eye. When the 

muscles are relaxed, the image of distant objects is focused on the retina.
When the muscles contract, the focal length is shortened, and this allows

images of closer objects to be focused on the retina. Biology ConnectionBiology Connection500-503 CH18-S3-845813  3/18/04  3:15 PM  Page 500As light enters the eye, it first encounters the air/cornea interface. 
Consider a ray of light that strikes the interface between the

air and a personÕs cornea at an angle of 30.0
°to the normal. The index of refraction of the cornea is approximately 1.4.
1.Use SnellÕs law to calculate the angle of refraction.
2.What would the angle of refraction be if the person was
swimming underwater?3.Is the refraction greater in air or in water? Does this mean

501abcdContactsContact lenses
produce the same results as
eyeglasses do. These small, thin

lenses are placed directly on the

corneas. A thin layer of tears
between the cornea and lens
keeps the lens in place. Most of
the refraction occurs at the air-lens
surface, where the difference in

indices of refraction is greatest.
Nearsightedness and farsightedness
The eyes of many people do not
focus sharp images on the retina. Instead, images are focused either in
front of the retina or behind it. External lenses, in the form of eyeglasses or

contact lenses, are needed to adjust the focal length and move images to

the retina. Figure 18-19ashows the condition of 
nearsightedness,
ormyopia, whereby the focal length of the eye is too short to focus light on the

retina. Images are formed in front of the retina. As shown in 
Figure 18-19b,
concave lenses correct this by diverging light, thereby increasing imagesÕ

distances from the lens, and forming images on the retina.
You also can see in 
Figure 18-19cthat farsightedness,
or hyperopia, is
the condition in which the focal length of the eye is too long. Images are

therefore formed past the retina. A similar result is caused by the increas-

ing rigidity of the lenses in the eyes of people who are more than about 

45 years old. Their muscles cannot shorten the focal length enough to

focus images of close objects on the retina. For either defect, convex lenses

produce virtual images farther from the eye than the associated objects, as

shown in 
Figure 18-19d.The images then become the objects for the eye
lens and can be focused on the retina, thereby correcting the defect.

An astronomical refracting telescope uses lenses to magnify distantobjects. 
Figure 18-20
shows the optical system for a Keplerian telescope.
Light from stars and other astronomical objects is so far away that the rays
can be considered parallel. The parallel rays of light enter the objective con-

vex lens and are focused as a real image at the focal point of the objective

lens. The image is inverted compared to the object. This image then

becomes the object for the convex lens of the eyepiece. Notice that the eye-

piece lens is positioned so that the focal point of the objective lens is

between the eyepiece lens and its focal point. This means that a virtual

image is produced that is upright and larger than the first image. However,

because the first image was already inverted, the final image is still inverted.

For viewing astronomical objects, an image that is inverted is acceptable.
In a telescope, the convex lens of the eyepiece is almost always an achro-
matic lens. Recall that an achromatic lens is a combination of lenses that

function as one lens. The combination of lenses eliminates the peripheral

colors, or chromatic aberration, that can form on images.
Binoculars
Binoculars, like telescopes, produce magnified
images of faraway 
objects. 
Figure 18-21
shows a 
typical binocular design. Each side of the binoculars is
like a small telescope: light enters a convex objective

lens, which inverts the image. The light then travels

through two prisms that use total internal reflection to

invert the image again, so that the viewer sees an image

that is upright compared to the object. The prisms also
extend the path along which the light travels and direct

it toward the eyepiece of the binoculars. Just as the 

separation of your two eyes gives you a sense of three

dimensions and depth, the prisms allow a greater 

separation of the objective lenses, thereby improving

the three-dimensional view of a distant object.Objective lensEyepiecePrismsThumbscrewFigure 18-21

Figure 18-22ashows the optical system used in a single-lens reflex 
camera. As light enters the camera, it passes through an achromatic lens.
This lens system refracts the light much like a single convex lens would,

forming an image that is inverted on the reflex mirror. The image is

reflected upward to a prism that inverts and redirects the light to the

viewfinder. When the person holding the camera takes a photograph, he

or she presses the shutter-release button, which briefly raises
the mirror, as shown in 
Figure 18-22b.
The light, instead ofbeing diverted upward to the prism, then travels along a

straight path to form an image on the film.Microscopes
Like a telescope, a microscope has both an objective 
convex lens and a convex eyepiece. However, microscopes

are used to view small objects. 
Figure 18-23shows the 
optical system used in a simple compound microscope. The

object is located between one and two focal lengths from the

objective lens. A real image is produced that is inverted and

larger than the object. As with a telescope, this image then

becomes the object for the eyepiece. This image is between

the eyepiece and its focal point. A virtual image is produced

that is upright and larger than the image of the objective

lens. Thus, the viewer sees an image that is inverted and

greatly larger than the original object.Figure 18-22

506Extreme PhysicsIn 1919, comparison of starlight before and
during a solar eclipse proved EinsteinÕs theory

to be true.
In 1936, Einstein proposed the phenome-non of the gravitational lens. Because light can

be bent by the gravitational fields of massive

objects, virtual images of rings should be seen

by observers on Earth when a massive object is

between Earth and the object being observed.

Einstein never observed such a phenomenon,

but his theory of relativity supported the 
possible existence of gravitational lenses.
Further work by astronomers around the
world confirmed that there was just a single

quasar, and that its light was being distorted 

by a cluster of galaxies dominated by a 

massive elliptical galaxy lying in the line of

sight between the quasar and Earth. The

astronomers realized that they were seeing 

two images of one quasar. The galaxy acted 

like an imperfect convex lens, focusing the

deflected light in such a way that two images

were formed from one object. Why would they

think that the light was bent?
Gravity and Light
The astronomersremembered the work of Albert Einstein and

his theory of relativity. Einstein proposed 

that light would be bent by the gravitational

fields of massive objects. In the classical theory

of space, known as Euclidean space, light trav-

els in a straight line. According to Einstein, 

light bends when it comes near a massive object.
Gravitational Lenses
In 1979, astronomers atthe Jodrell BankObservatory in Great Britain discovered two
quasars that were separated by only 7 arc sec-

onds (seven 0.36thÕs of a degree).

Measurements showed they should have been

500,000 light years apart. The two quasars

seemed to fluctuate in brightness and in
rhythm with each other. The most amazing

thing, however, was that the quasars had iden-

tical spectra. There appeared to be two differ-

ent objects, but the two objects were the same.
The Evidence
As often occurs in science, once
someone discovers something for the first time,

many more supporting disco
veries 
are madesoon after. Since EinsteinÕs proposals, and the

discovery in 1979 of the double-image quasar,

many more gravitational lenses have been

observed. Both EinsteinÕs rings and multiple

images have been observed. EinsteinÕs rings

result when the gravitational lens and the light

from the object are in near-perfect alignment.
Multiple images are formed when the gravita-

tional lens and the light from the object are not
in perfect alignment. Over 50 gravitational lenses

have been discovered.
The blue shapes are multiple images of the same
galaxy produced by gravitational lensing from galaxy

cluster 0024+1654 in the center of the photo.
The illustration shows how light from a distant galaxy is

Key Concepts
¥The path of travel of light bends when it passes from a medium with an
index of refraction, n1, into a medium with a different index of refraction, n2.¥The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum, 
c, to the speed of light in any
medium, v, is the index of refraction, n, of the medium.¥When light traveling through a medium hits a boundary of a medium with 

a smaller index of refraction, if the angle of incidence exceeds the critical
angle, 
c, the light will be reflected back into the original medium by total
internal reflection.sincnn21nvcn1sin 1n2sin 2Key Concepts
¥The focal length, f; the object position, do; and the image position, di, for a lens are related by the thin lens equation. 
¥The magnification, m, of an image by a lens is defined in the same way as
the magnification of an image by a mirror. 
¥A single convex lens produces a real image that is inverted when the object
position is greater than the focal length. The image is reduced or enlarged,
depending on the object position.¥A single convex lens produces a virtual image that is upright and larger 

than the object when the object is located between the lens and the 

focal point.¥A single concave lens always produces a virtual image that is upright and

smaller than the object.¥All simple lenses have chromatic aberration. All lenses made with spherical

surfaces have spherical aberration.

to the surface. The light rays refract into the air as

shown. The red dashed line extending back from the

the vertical ray at the location where an observer

would see the image of the bottom of the tank.

In Chapter 16, you learned that light sometimes acts like a wave. Light

can be diffracted when it passes by an edge, just like water waves and
sound waves can. In Chapters 17 and 18, you learned that reflection and

refraction can be explained when light is modeled as a wave. What led 

scientists to believe that light has wave properties? They discovered that

light could be made to interfere, which you will learn about in this section.
When you look at objects that are illuminated by a white light source
such as a nearby lightbulb, you are seeing 
incoherent light,which is lightwith unsynchronized wave fronts. The effect of incoherence in waves can

be seen in the example of heavy rain falling on a swimming pool. The sur-

face of the water is choppy and does not 
have any regular pattern of wave
fronts or standing waves. Because light waves have such a high frequency,

incoherent light does not appear choppy to you. Instead, as light from an
incoherent white light source illuminates an object, you see the superpo-

sition of the incoherent light waves as an even, white light.

The opposite of incoherent light is coherent light,which is light fromtwo or more sources that add together in superposition to produce smooth
wave 
fronts. A smooth wave front can be created by a point source, as
shown in 
Figure 19-1a.A smooth wave front also can be created by mul-
tiple point sources when all point sources are synchronized, such as with

a laser, as shown in 
Figure 19-1b.
Only the superposition of light waves
from coherent light sources can produce the interference phenomena that
you will examine in this section.
English physician Thomas Young proved that light has wave properties
when he produced an interference pattern by shining light from a single

coherent source through two slits. Young directed coherent light at two

closely spaced, narrow slits in a barrier. When the overlapping light from

the two slits fell on an observing screen, the overlap did not produce even
illumination, but instead created a pattern of bright and
dark bands that Young called 
interference fringes.
Heexplained that these bands must be the result of constructive

and destructive interference of light waves from the two slits

in the barrier.
In a double-slit interference experiment that uses monochromatic light,which is light of only one wave-
length, constructive interference produces a bright central

band of the given color on the screen, as well as other

bright bands of near-equal spacing and near-equal width on
either side, as shown in 
Figures 19-2aand 19-2b. 
Theintensity  of 
the bright bands decreases the farther theband is from the central band, as you can easily see in

Figure 19-2a. Between the bright bands are dark areas

where destructive interference occurs. The positions of the

constructive and destructive interference bands depend on

the wavelength of the light. When white light is used in a

double-slit experiment, however, interference causes the

appearance of colored spectra instead of bright and dark
bands, as shown in 
Figure 19-2c.All wavelengths interfere
constructively in the central bright band, and thus that band

is white. The positions of the other colored bands result

from the overlap of the interference fringes that occur where

wavelengths of each separate color interfere constructively.

To create coherent light from incoherent light,
Young placed a light barrier with a narrow slit in front of a monochromatic
light source. Because the width of the slit is very small, only a coherent 

portion of the light passes through and is diffracted by the slit, producing

nearly cylindrical diffracted wave 
fronts, as shown in 
Figure 19-3.Because acylinder is symmetrical, the two portions of the 
wave 
front arriving at thesecond barrier with two slits will be in phase. The two slits at the second bar-

rier then produce coherent, nearly cylindrical wave fronts that can then inter-

fere, as shown in Figure 19-3. Depending on their phase relationship, the

two waves can undergo constructive or destructive interference, as shown 

in Figure 19-4.Section 19.1Interference

Measuring the wavelength of light
A top view of nearly cylindrical wave
fronts and YoungÕs double slit experiment are shown in 
Figure 19-5a.Thewave 
fronts interfere constructively and destructively to form a pattern of
light and dark bands. A typical diagram that is used to analyze YoungÕs

experiment is shown in 
Figure 19-5b.
Light that reaches point P0travels
the same distance from each slit. Because the waves are in phase, they inter-

fere constructively on the screen to create the central bright band at P
0.There is also constructive interference at the first bright band, P
1, on eitherside of the central band, because line segment P1S1is one wavelength, 
,longer than the line segment P1S2. Thus, the waves arrive at P
1in phase.
There are two triangles shaded in the figure. The larger triangle is a right
triangle, so tan 
x/L. In the smaller triangle RS1S2, the side S1R is thelength difference of the two light paths, which is one wavelength. There are

now two simplifications that make the problem easier to solve.
1.If Lis much larger than d, then line segments S1P1and S2P1arenearly parallel to each other and to line segment QP1, and triangleRS1S2is very nearly a right triangle. Thus, sin 
/d.2.If the angle is small, then sin is very nearly equal to tan 
.With the above simplifications, the relationships tan 
x/L, sin /d,and sin tan combine to form the equation x/L/d. Solving for gives the following.
Constructive interference from two slits occurs at locations, 
xm, oneither side of the central bright band, which are determined using the
equation mxmd/L, where m0, 1, 2, etc., as limited by the small angle
simplification. The central bright band occurs at m0. Frequently, the
band given by 
m1 is called the first-order band, and so on.Wavelength from Double-Slit Experiment

on the screen from the central bright band to the first bright band, multiplied
by the distance between the slits, divided by the distance to the screen.

Have you ever seen a spectrum of colors produced by a soap bubble or
by the oily film on a water puddle in a parking lot? These colors were not
the result of separation of white light by a prism or of absorption of colors

in a pigment. The spectrum of colors was a result of the constructive and

destructive interference of light waves due to reflection in a thin film, a

phenomenon called thin-film interference.
If a soap film is held vertically, as in 
Figure 19-6,its weight makes it
thicker at the bottom than at the top. The thickness varies gradually from

top to bottom. When a light wave strikes the film, it is partially reflected,

as shown by ray 1, and partially transmitted. The reflected and transmitted

waves have the same frequency as the original. The transmitted wave trav-

els through the film to the back surface, where, again, part is reflected, as

shown by ray 2. This act of splitting each light wave from an incoherent

source into a matched pair of waves means that the reflected light from a

thin film is coherent.Color reinforcement
How is the reflection of one color enhanced? This
happens when the two reflected waves are in phase for a given wavelength.
If the thickness of the soap film in Figure 19-6 is one-fourth of the wave-

length of the wave in the film, 
/4, then the round-trip path length in thefilm is /2. In this case, it would appear that ray 2 would return to the front
surface one-half wavelength out of phase with ray 1, and that the two
waves would cancel each other based on the superposition principle.

However, when a transverse wave is reflected from a medium with a slower

wave 
speed, the wave is inverted. With light, this happens at a medium
with a larger index of refraction. As a result, ray 1 is inverted on reflection;

whereas ray 2 is reflected from a medium with a smaller index of refraction

(air) and is not inverted. Thus, ray 1 and ray 2 are in phase.
If the film thickness, 
d, satisfies the requirement, d/4, then the colorof light with that wavelength will be most strongly reflected. Note that

because the wavelength of light in the film is shorter than the wavelength

in air, 
dfilm/4, or, in terms of the wavelength in air, 
dvacuum
/4nfilm.The two waves reinforce each other as they leave the film. Light with other

wavelengths undergoes destructive interference.
Nonreflective Eyeglasses
A thin film can be placed on the
lenses of eyeglasses to keep 

them from reflecting wavelengths
of light that are highly visible 
to the human eye. This prevents

the glare of reflected light.Tom Pantages

521Thin-Film Interference
When solving thin-film interference problems, construct an equation that is specific to 
the problem by using the following strategies.
1.Make a sketch of the thin film and the two coherent waves. For simplicity, draw
the waves as rays.
2.Read the problem. Is the reflected light enhanced or reduced? When it is

enhanced, the two reflected waves undergo constructive interference. When 

the reflected light is reduced, the waves undergo destructive interference.
3.Are either or both waves inverted on reflection? If the index of refraction

changes from a lower to a higher value, then the wave is inverted. If it changes

from a higher to a lower value, there is no inversion.4.Find the extra distance that the second wave must travel through the thin film to

create the needed interference.
a.If you need constructive interference and one wave 
is inverted OR you need destructive interference 

and either both waves or none are inverted, then the 

difference in distance is an odd number of half 

wavelengths: (m1/2)film, where m0, 1, 2, etc. b.If you need constructive interference and either both 

waves or none are inverted OR you need destructive 

interference and one wave is inverted, then the 

difference is an integer number of wavelengths: mfilm, where m1, 2, 3, etc.5.Set the extra distance traveled by the second ray to 
twice the film thickness, 2
d.6.Recall from Chapter 18 that 
filmvacuum/nfilm.Reflection from a Thin Film
n1n2Medium 2Medium 1Ray 1Ray 2nfilmFilmdAs you know, different colors of light have different wavelengths. For a
film of varying thickness, such as the one shown in Figure 19-6, the wave-
length requirement will be met at different thicknesses for different colors.

The result is a rainbow of color. Where the film is too thin to produce con-

structive interference for any wavelength of color, the film appears to be

black. Notice in Figure 19-6b that the spectrum repeats. When the thick-

ness of the film is 3/4, the round-trip distance is 3/2, and constructive
interference occurs again. Any thickness equal to 1
/4, 3/4, 5/4, and so on,satisfies the conditions for constructive interference for a given wavelength.
Applications of thin-film interference
The example of a film of soapy
water in air involves constructive interference with one of two waves
inverted upon reflection. In the chapter opener example of bubble solution,

as the thickness of the film changes, the wavelength undergoing constructive

interference changes. This creates a shifting spectrum of color on the surface

of the film soap when it is under white light. In other examples of thin-
film interference, neither wave or both waves might be inverted. You can

develop a solution for any problem involving thin-film interference using

the following strategies.

Figure 19-8
Notice the widecentral band and the narrowerbands on either side. A single-slit
diffraction pattern for red light
would have a wider central band
than blue light as long as the
same size slit is used for both

colors.In Chapter 16, you learned that smooth 
wave 
fronts of light spreadwhen they are diffracted around an edge. Diffraction was explained
using HuygensÕ principle that a smooth wave front is made up of many

small point-source wavelets. The cutting of coherent light on two edges

spaced closely together produces a diffraction pattern,which is a patternon a screen of constructive and destructive interference of HuygensÕ

wavelets.
Single-Slit Diffraction
When coherent, blue light passes through a single, small opening that is
larger than the wavelength of the light, the light is diffracted by both edges,

and a series of bright and dark bands appears on a distant screen, as shown

in Figure 19-8.Instead of the nearly equally spaced bands produced by
two coherent sources in YoungÕs double-slit experiment, this pattern has a

wide, bright central band with dimmer, narrower bands on either side.

When using red light instead of blue, the width of the bright central band

increases. With white light, the pattern is a mixture of patterns of all the

colors of the spectrum.To see how HuygensÕ wavelets produce the diffraction pattern, imagine
a slit of width was being divided into an even number of HuygensÕ points,
as shown in 
Figure 19-9.Each HuygensÕ point acts as a point source ofHuygensÕ wavelets. Divide the slit into two equal parts and choose one

source from each part so that the pair is separated by a distance 
w/2. Thispair of sources produces coherent, cylindrical waves that will interfere.
For any HuygensÕ wavelet produced in the top half, there will be another
HuygensÕ wavelet in the bottom half, a distance 
w/2 away, that it will inter-
fere with destructively to create a dark band on the screen. All similar pair-

ings of HuygensÕ wavelets interfere destructively at dark bands. Conversely,

a bright band on the screen is where pairings of HuygensÕ wavelets inter-

fere constructively. In the dim regions between bright and dark bands, par-

tial destructive interference occurs.

Diffraction pattern
When the single slit is illuminated, a central brightband appears at location P0on the screen, as shown in 
Figure 19-10.
Thefirst dark band is at position P1. At this location, the path lengths 
r1and r2of the two HuygensÕ 
wavelets differ by one-half 
wavelength, thereby produc-
ing a dark band by destructive interference. This model is mathematically

similar to that of double-slit interference. A comparison of a single-slit 

diffraction pattern with a double-slit interference pattern using slits of the
same width reveals that all of the bright interference fringes of the double-

slit interference pattern fit within the width of the central bright band of
the single-slit diffraction pattern. Double-slit interference results from the
interference of the single-slit diffraction patterns of the two slits.
An equation now can be developed for the diffraction pattern produced
by a single slit using the same simplifications that were used for double-slit

interference, assuming that the distance to the screen is much larger than

w. The separation distance between the sources of the two interfering
waves is now 
w/2. To find the distance 
measured on the screen to the firstdark band, x1, note that the path length difference is now 
/2 because at thedark band there is destructive interference. As a result 
x1/L/w.You can see from Figure 19-10 that it might be difficult to measure the
distance to the first dark band from the center of the central bright band.
A better method of determining x1is to measure the width of the centralbright band, 2x1. The following equation gives the width of the central
bright band from single-slit diffraction.Canceling the 2Õs out of the above equation gives you the distance from the
center of the central bright band to where the first dark band occurs. The

location of additional dark bands can be found where the path lengths dif-
fer by 3
/2, 5/2, and so on. This can be expressed as xmmL/w, wherem1, 2, 3, etc., as limited by the small angle simplication. When 
m1, this equation provides the position of the first-order dark band. The
second-order dark band occurs at m2, and so forth.Width of Bright Band in Single-Slit Diffraction2x12wLThe width of the central bright band is equal to the product of twice the
wavelength times the distance to the screen, divided by the width of the slit.

the single-slit pattern depends on the wavelength of light, it is only when

a large number of slits are put together that diffraction provides a useful

tool for measuring wavelength.

Although double-slit interference and single-slit diffrac-tion depend on the wavelength of light, 
diffraction gratings,
such as those shown in 
Figure 19-11,
are used to make pre-cision measurements of wavelength. A 
diffraction gratingis a device made up of many single slits that diffract light
and form a diffraction pattern that is an overlap of single-

slit diffraction patterns. Diffraction gratings can have as

many as 10,000 slits per centimeter. That is, the spacing

between the slits can be as small as 10

One type of diffraction grating is called a transmissiongrating. A transmission grating can be made by scratching

very fine lines with a diamond point on glass that trans-

mits light. The spaces between the scratched lines act like

slits. A less expensive type of grating is a replica grating. A replica grating is

made by pressing a thin plastic sheet onto a glass grating. When the plastic

is pulled away, it contains an accurate imprint of the scratches. Jewelry made

from replica gratings, shown in 
Figure 19-12a,produces a spectrum.Reflection gratings are made by inscribing fine lines on metallic or
reflective glass surfaces. The color spectra produced when white light

reflects off the surface of a CD or DVD is the result of a reflection grating,

as shown in 
Figure 19-12b.
If you were to shine monochromatic light on
a DVD, the reflected light would produce a diffraction pattern on a screen.

Transmission and reflection gratings produce similar diffraction patterns,

which can be analyzed in the same manner.
Holographic diffraction gratings produce the brightest spectra. They aremade by using a laser and mirrors to create an interference pattern consisting

of parallel bright and dark lines. The pattern is projected on a piece of metal

that is coated with a light-sensitive material. The light produces a chemical

reaction that hardens the material. The metal is then placed in acid, which
attacks the metal wherever it was not protected by the hardened material.

The result is a series of hills and valleys in the metal identical to the original

interference pattern. The metal can be used as a reflection grating or a replica
transmission grating can be made from it. Because of the sinusoidal shape
of the hills and valleys, the diffraction patterns are exceptionally bright.

A grating wasused to produce diffractionpatterns for red light (a)and white light (b).abMeasuring wavelength
An instrument used to measure light wave-
lengths using a diffraction grating is called a grating spectroscope, as
shown in the diagram in 
Figure 19-13.The source to be analyzed emitslight that is directed to a slit. The light from the slit passes through a 
diffraction grating. The grating produces a diffraction pattern that is
viewed through a telescope.
The diffraction pattern produced by a diffraction grating has narrow,
equally spaced, bright lines, as shown in 
Figure 19-14.The larger thenumber of slits per unit length of the grating, the narrower the lines in the

diffraction pattern. As a result, the distance between the bright lines can be

measured much more precisely with a grating spectroscope than with a
double slit.Earlier in this chapter, you found that the interference pattern produced
by a double slit could be used to calculate wavelength. An equation for the

diffraction grating can be developed in the same way as for the double slit.

However, with a diffraction grating, 
could be large, so the small angle
simplification does not apply. Wavelength can be found by measuring the

angle, 
, between the central bright line and the first-order bright line.
Constructive interference from a diffraction grating occurs at angles on
either side of the central bright line given by the equation 
mdsin,where m0, 1, 2, etc. The central bright line occurs at m0.Wavelength from a Diffraction Grating
dsinThe wavelength of light is equal to the slit separation distance times the sine
of the angle at which the first-order bright line occurs.528Chapter 19Interference and Diffraction

In thin-film interference, the interference pattern is visible only within
a narrow angle of view straight over the film. This would be the case for the
MorphobutterflyÕs blue, shimmering interference pattern, if not for the
layer of glass-like scales on top of the layer of ground scales. This glass-like

scale layer acts as a diffraction grating and causes the blue, shimmering

interference pattern to be spread to a diffraction pattern with a wider angle
of view. Scientists believe that this makes the 
Morphobutterfly more visibleto potential mates. 
Resolving Power of Lenses
The circular lens of a telescope, a microscope, and even your eye acts as
a hole, called an aperture, through which light is allowed to pass. An 

aperture diffracts the light, just as a single slit does. Alternating bright and

dark rings occur with a circular aperture, as shown in 
Figure 19-15.Theequation for an aperture is similar to that for a single slit. However, an

aperture has a circular edge rather than the two edges of a slit, so slit width,

w, is replaced by aperture diameter, 
D, and an extra geometric factor of1.22 enters the equation, resulting in x11.22L/D.When light from a distant star is viewed through the aperture of a tele-
scope, the image is spread out due to diffraction. If two stars are close

enough together, the images may be blurred together, as shown in 
Figure19-16.In 1879, Lord Rayleigh, a British physicist, mathematician, and
Nobel prize winner, established a criterion for determining whether there

is one or two stars in such an image. The 
Rayleigh criterion
states that ifthe center of the bright spot of one starÕs image falls on the first dark ring

of the second, the two images are at the limit of resolution. That is, a

viewer will be able to tell that there are two stars rather than only one.
If two images are at the limit of resolution, how far apart are the objects?
Using the Rayleigh criterion, the centers of the bright spots of the 

two images are a distance of 
x1apart. Figure 19-16 shows that similar 
triangles can be used to find that xobj/Lobjx1/L. Combining this withx11.22L/Dto eliminate x1/L, and solving for the separation distancebetween objects, 
xobj, the following equation can be derived. 
Rayleigh Criterion
xobj1.22DLobjThe separation distance between objects that are at the limit of resolution is
equal to 1.22, times the wavelength of light, times the distance from the circular

aperture to the objects, divided by the diameter of the circular aperture.

Monochromatic green light of wavelength 546 nm
falls on a single slit of width 0.080 mm. The slit is

tion of the first dark bands on each side of the 
central bright band?27.
Diffraction Patterns
Many narrow slits are close
to each other and equally spaced in a large piece
of cardboard. They are illuminated by monochro-

matic red light. A sheet of white paper is placed far
from the slits, and a pattern of bright and dark

bands is visible on the paper. Sketch the pattern

that would be seen on the screen.28.Line SpacingYou shine a red laser light through
one diffraction grating and form a pattern of red
dots on a screen. Then you substitute a second dif-

fraction grating for the first one, forming a differentpattern. The dots produced by the first grating are

spread out more than those produced by the sec-
ond. Which grating has more lines per millimeter?
29.Rayleigh Criterion
The brightest star in the win-
ter sky in the northern hemisphere is Sirius. In 

reality, Sirius is a system of two stars that orbit each

other. If the 
Hubble Space Telescope
(diameter 2.4 m) is pointed at the Sirius system, which is 
8.44 light-years from Earth, what is the minimum

separation there would need to be between the
stars in order for the telescope to be able to resolve

them? Assume that the average light coming fromthe stars has a wavelength of 550 nm.
30.
Critical ThinkingYou are shown a spectrometer,
but do not know whether it produces its spectrum

with a prism or a grating. By looking at a white-
light spectrum, how could you tell?19.2Section Review
Section 19.2Diffraction
531physicspp.com/self_check_quizDiffraction in the eye
In bright light the eyeÕs pupil is about 3 mm in
diameter. The eye is most sensitive to yellow-green light where 
550 nm.
So the Rayleigh criterion applied to the eye gives 
xobj2104Lobj. Thedistance between the pupil and retina is about 2 cm, so two barely resolved
point sources would be separated by about 4 
m on the retina. The spac-ing between the light detectors, the cones, in the most sensitive part of the

eye, the fovea, is about 2 
m. Thus, in the ideal case, the three adjacent
cones would record light, dark, and light. It would seem that the eye is ide-

ally constructed. If cones were closer together, they would see details of the

diffraction pattern, not of the sources. If cones were farther apart, they

would not be able to resolve all possible detail. 
Applying the Rayleigh criterion to find the ability of the eye to separate
two distance sources shows that the eye could separate two automobile

headlamps (1.5 m apart) at a distance of 7 km. In practice, however, the

eye is not limited by diffraction. Imperfections in the lens and the liquid

that fills the eye reduce the eyeÕs resolution to about five times that set 

by the Rayleigh criterion. Most people use their eyes for purposes other

than resolving point sources. For example, the eye seems to have a built-in

ability to detect straight edges.
Many telescope manufacturers advertise that their instruments are dif-
fraction limited. That is, they claim that their telescopes can separate two

point sources at the Rayleigh criterion. To reach this limit they must grind

the mirrors and lenses to an accuracy of one-tenth of a wavelength, or about

55 nm. The larger the diameter of the mirror, the greater the resolution of

the telescope. Unfortunately, light from planets or stars must go through

EarthÕs atmosphere. The same variations in the atmosphere that cause stars

to twinkle keep telescopes from reaching the diffraction limit. Because the
Hubble Space Telescope
is above EarthÕs atmosphere, the resolution of its
images is much better than those of larger telescopes on EarthÕs surface.

¥Incoherent light illuminates an object evenly, just as a lightbulb illuminates 
your desk.
¥Only the superposition of light waves from coherent light sources can
produce an interference pattern.¥Interference demonstrates that light has wave properties.
¥Light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits produces a pattern 

on a screen of dark and light bands called interference fringes.
¥Interference patterns can be used to measure the wavelength of light.
¥Interference patterns can result from the creation of coherent light at 
the refractive boundary of a thin film.
xLdKey Concepts
¥Light passing through a narrow slit is diffracted, or spread out from a

straight-line path, and produces a diffraction pattern on a screen. ¥The diffraction pattern from a single slit has a bright central band that has 
a width equal to the distance between the first dark bands on either side of

the bright central band.¥Diffraction gratings consist of large numbers of slits that are very close

together and produce narrow lines that result from an overlap of the single-

slit diffraction patterns of all of the slits in the grating.¥Diffraction gratings can be used to measure the wavelength of light precisely
or to separate light composed of different wavelengths.
¥Diffraction limits the ability of an aperture to distinguish two closely 

spaced objects. 
¥If the central bright spot of one image falls on the first dark ring of the
second image, the images are at the limit of resolution.

the width of the central bright spot calculated

create a spark when you touched someone. In 1752, Benjamin
Franklin set off a flurry of research in the field of electricity when his
famous kite experiment showed that lightning is similar to the sparks

caused by friction. In his experiment, Franklin flew a kite with a key

attached to the string. As a thunderstorm approached, the loose threads of
the kite string began to stand up and repel one another, and when Franklin

brought his knuckle close to the key, he experienced a spark. Electric effects

produced in this way are called static electricity.
In this chapter, you will investigate 
electrostatics,
the study of electriccharges that can be collected and held in one place. The effects of 

electrostatics are observable over a vast scale, from huge displays of 

lightning to the submicroscopic world of atoms and molecules. Current

electricity, which is produced by batteries and generators, will be explored

in later chapters.

Have you ever noticed the way that your hair is attracted to the comb
when you comb your hair on a dry day or the way that your hair stands on
end after it is rubbed with a balloon? Perhaps you also have found that

socks sometimes stick together when you take them out of a clothes dryer.

If so, you will recognize the attraction of the bits of paper to a plastic ruler

demonstrated by the Launch Lab and shown in 
Figure 20-1.
You might
have noticed the way the paper pieces jumped up to the ruler as you

worked through the Launch Lab. There must be a new, relatively strong

force causing this upward acceleration because it is larger than the down-

ward acceleration caused by the gravitational force of Earth.
There are other differences between this new force and gravity. Paper is
attracted to a plastic ruler only after the ruler has been rubbed; if you wait

a while, the attractive property of the ruler disappears. Gravity, on the other

hand, does not require rubbing and does not disappear. The ancient

Greeks noticed effects similar to that of the ruler when they rubbed amber.

The Greek word for amber is 
elektron,
and today this attractive property is
called electric. An object that exhibits electric interaction after rubbing is
said to be charged.Like chargesYou can explore electric interactions with simple objects,
such as transparent tape. Fold over about 5 mm of the end of a strip of tape
for a handle, and then stick the remaining 8- to 12-cm-long part of the 

tape strip on a dry, smooth surface, such as your desktop. Stick a second,

similar piece of tape next to the first. Quickly pull both strips off the desk
and bring them near each other. A new property causes the strips to repeleach other: they are electrically charged. Because they were prepared in the

same way, they must have the same type of charge. Thus, you have demon-

strated that two objects with the same type of charge repel each other.
You can learn more about this charge by doing some
simple experiments. You may have found that the tape is
attracted to your hand. Are both sides attracted, or just

one? If you wait a while, especially in humid weather,

you will find that the electric charge disappears. You can

restore it by again sticking the tape to the desk and

pulling it off. You also can remove its charge by gently

rubbing your fingers down both sides of the tape.
Opposite chargesNow, stick one strip of tape on the
desk and place the second strip on top of the first. Asshown in 
Figure 20-2a,
use the handle of the bottomstrip of tape to pull the two off the desk together. Rub them

with your fingers until they are no longer attracted to your

hand. You now have removed all the electric charge. With

one hand on the handle of one strip and the other on the
handle of the second strip, quickly pull the two stripsapart. You will find that they are now both charged. They

once again are attracted to your hands. Do they still repel

each other? No, they now attract each other. They are

charged, but they are no longer charged alike. They have

opposite charges and therefore attract each other.
Figure 20-1
Rubbing a plasticruler with wool produces a new
force of attraction between the
ruler and bits of paper. When the

ruler is brought close to bits of

paper, the attractive electric force

accelerates the paper bits upward

against the force of gravity.

543Is tape the only object that you can charge? Once
again, stick one strip of tape to the desk and the second strip on top. Label the bottom strip Band thetop strip T. Pull the pair off together. Discharge them,
then pull them apart. Stick the handle end of each
strip to the edge of a table, the bottom of a lamp

shade, or some similar object. The two should hang

down a short distance apart. Finally, rub a comb or

pen on your clothing and bring it near one strip of

tape and then the other. You will find that one strip

will be attracted to the comb, while the other will be

repelled by it, as shown in 
Figure 20-2b.
You now can
explore the interactions of charged objects with the
strips of tape.
Experimenting with chargeTry to charge other
objects, such as glasses and plastic bags. Rub them
with different materials, such as silk, wool, and plastic

wrap. If the air is dry, scuff your shoes on carpet and

bring your finger near the strips of tape. To test silk or

wool, slip a plastic bag over your hand before holding

the cloth. After rubbing, take your hand out of the bag

and bring both the bag and cloth near the strips of tape.
Most charged objects will attract one strip and repel the other. You will
never find an object that repels both strips of tape, although you might

find some that attract both. For example, your finger will attract both

strips. You will explore this effect later in this chapter.
Types of charge
From your experiments, you can make a list of objects
labeled B, for bottom, which have the same charge as the tape stuck on the
desk. Another list can be made of objects labeled T, which have the same
charge as the top strip of tape. There are only two lists, because there are
only two types of charge. Benjamin Franklin called them positive and 

negative charges. Using FranklinÕs convention, when hard rubber and 

plastic are rubbed, they become negatively charged. When materials such

as glass and wool are rubbed, they become positively charged.
Just as you showed that an uncharged pair of tape strips became oppo-
sitely charged, you probably were able to show that if you rubbed plastic

with wool, the plastic became negatively charged and the wool positively

charged. The two kinds of charges were not created alone, but in pairs.

These experiments suggest that matter normally contains both charges,

positive and negative. Contact in some way separates the two. To explore

this further, you must consider the microscopic picture of matter.
A Microscopic View of Charge
Electric charges exist within atoms. In 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered
that all materials contain light, negatively charged particles that he called

electrons. Between 1909 and 1911, Ernest Rutherford, a student of

Thomson from New Zealand, discovered that the atom has a massive, pos-

itively charged nucleus. When the positive charge of the nucleus equals the

negative charge of the surrounding electrons, then the atom is 
neutral.¥Positive charges are shown
in red.
¥Negative charges are
shown in blue.Figure 20-2

Conductor or Insulator?It might be tempting to classify an element as solely a conductor
or solely an insulator, but the

classification can change

depending on the form the
element takes. For example,

carbon in the form of diamond 

is an insulator, but carbon in the

form of graphite can conduct

charge. This is because the carbon

atoms in diamonds are tightly
bonded to four other carbons,

while the carbon atoms in graphite

form three stronger bonds and a
fourth, weaker bond that allows

electrons a limited amount of
movement. As a result, graphite 

is a much better conductor than
diamond, even though both are
simply carbon atoms.
++++++++++++++++++------------------Hard rubber rodWool
Figure 20-3
When wool is used
to charge a rubber rod, electronsare removed from the wool atoms
and cling to the rubber atoms. 
In this way, both objects become
charged.abWith the addition of energy, the outer electrons can be removed from
atoms. An atom missing electrons has an overall positive charge, and con-
sequently, any matter made of these electron-deficient atoms is positively

charged. The freed electrons can remain unattached or become attached to
other atoms, resulting in negatively charged particles. From a microscopic

viewpoint, acquiring charge is a process of transferring electrons.
Separation of charge
If two neutral objects are rubbed together, each can
become charged. For instance, when rubber and wool are rubbed together,
electrons from atoms on the wool are transferred to the rubber, as shown

in Figure 20-3.
The extra electrons on the rubber result in a net negative
charge. The electrons missing from the wool result in a net positive charge.

The combined total charge of the two objects remains the same. Charge is

conserved, which is one way of saying that individual charges never are 

created or destroyed. All that happens is that the positive and negative

charges are separated through a transfer of electrons.
Complex processes that affect the tires of a moving car or truck can cause
the tires to become charged. Processes inside a thundercloud can cause the
cloud bottom to become negatively charged and the cloud top to become

positively charged. In both these cases, charge is not created, but separated.
Conductors and Insulators
Hold a plastic rod or comb at its midpoint and rub only one end. You
will find that only the rubbed end becomes charged. In other words, the

charges that you transferred to the plastic stayed where they were put; they

did not move. A material through which a charge will not move easily is

called an electric insulator.
The strips of tape that you charged earlier 
in this chapter acted in this way. Glass, dry wood, most plastics, cloth, and

dry air are all good insulators.
Suppose that you support a metal rod on an insulator so that it is 
isolated, or completely surrounded by insulators. If you then touch the

charged comb to one end of the metal rod, you will find that the charge

spreads very quickly over the entire rod. A material that allows charges to

move about easily is called an electric 
conductor.
Electrons carry, or con-
duct, electric charge through the metal. Metals are good conductors
because at least one electron on each atom of the metal can be removed

easily. These electrons act as if they no longer belong to any one atom, but

to the metal as a whole; consequently, they move freely throughout the

piece of metal. Figure 20-4
contrasts how charges behave when they are
Horizons Companies540-545 CH20-S1-845813  3/22/04  2:34 AM  Page 544placed on a conductor with how they behave on an insulator. Copper and
aluminum are both excellent conductors and are used commercially to
carry electricity. Plasma, a highly ionized gas, and graphite also are good

conductors of electric charge.
When air becomes a conductor
Air is an insulator; however, under 
certain conditions, charges move through air as if it were a conductor. The
spark that jumps between your finger and a doorknob after you have rubbed

your feet on a carpet discharges you. In other words, you have become neu-

tral because the excess charges have left you. Similarly, lightning discharges

a thundercloud. In both of these cases, air became a conductor for a brief

moment. Recall that conductors must have charges that are free to move.

For a spark or lightning to occur, freely moving charged particles must be

formed in the normally neutral air. In the case of lightning, excess charges

in the cloud and on the ground are great enough to remove electrons from

the molecules in the air. The electrons and positively or negatively charged

atoms form a plasma, which is a conductor. The discharge of Earth and the

thundercloud by means of this conductor forms a luminous arc called

lightning. In the case of your finger and the doorknob, the discharge is

called a spark.Section 20.1Electric Charge

A charged rod,when brought close to anothercharged and suspended rod, will
attract or repel the suspended rod.abcElectric forces must be strong because they can easily produce acceler-ations larger than the acceleration caused by gravity. You also have
learned that they can be either repulsive or attractive, while gravitational

forces always are attractive. Over the years, many scientists made attempts

to measure electric forces. Daniel Bernoulli, best known for his work 

with fluids, made some crude measurements in 1760. In the 1770s, Henry

Cavendish showed that electric forces must obey an inverse square force

law, but being extremely shy, he did not publish his work. His manuscripts

were discovered over a century later, after all his work had been duplicated

by others.
Forces on Charged Bodies
The forces that you observed on tape strips also can be demonstrated by
suspending a negatively charged, hard rubber rod so that it turns easily, as

shown in 
Figure 20-5.
If you bring another negatively charged rod near
the suspended rod, the suspended rod will turn away. The negative charges

on the rods repel each other. It is not necessary for the rods to make con-

tact. The force, called the electric force, acts at a distance. If a positively

charged glass rod is suspended and a similarly charged glass rod is brought
close, the two positively charged rods also will repel each other. If a nega-

tively charged rod is brought near a positively charged rod, however, the

two will attract each other, and the suspended rod will turn toward the

oppositely charged rod. The results of your tape experiments and these

actions of charged rods can be summarized in the following way:
¥There are two kinds of electric charges: positive and negative.
¥Charges exert forces on other charges at a distance.
¥The force is stronger when the charges are closer together.
¥Like charges repel; opposite charges attract.Neither a strip of tape nor a large rod that is hanging in open air is a very 
sensitive or convenient way of determining charge. Instead, a device called
an electroscope is used. An electroscopeconsists of a metal knob con-nected by a metal stem to two thin, lightweight pieces of metal foil, called

leaves. 
Figure 20-6
shows a neutral electroscope. Note that the leaves hang
loosely and are enclosed to eliminate stray air currents.

547+++++--------------------------------------------abcCharging by conductionWhen a negatively charged rod is touched to the
knob of an electroscope, electrons are 
added to the knob. These charges
spread over all the metal surfaces. As shown in 
Figure 20-7a,
the two leaves
are charged negatively and repel each other; therefore, they spread apart.
The electroscope has been given a net charge. Charging a neutral body by

touching it with a charged body is called charging by conduction.
Theleaves also will spread apart if the electroscope is charged positively. How,

then, can you find out whether the electroscope is charged positively or

negatively? The type of charge can be determined by observing the leaves

when a rod of known charge is brought close to the knob. The leaves will

spread farther apart if the rod and the electroscope have the same charge,

as shown in 
Figure 20-7b.
The leaves will fall slightly if the electroscopeÕs
charge is opposite that of the rod, as in Figure 20-7c.
Separation of charge on neutral objects
Earlier in this chapter, when you
brought your finger near either charged strip of tape, the tape was attracted

to your finger. Your finger, however, was neutralÑit had equal amounts of

positive and negative charge. You know that in conductors, charges can

move easily, and that in the case of sparks, electric forces can change insu-

lators into conductors. Given this information, you can develop a plausi-

ble model for the force that your finger exerted on the strips of tape.
Suppose you move your finger, or any uncharged object, close to a 
positively charged object. The negative charges in your finger will be

attracted to the positively charged object, and the positive charges in your

finger will be repelled. Your finger will remain neutral, but the positive and

negative charges will be separated. The electric force is stronger for charges

that are closer together; therefore, the separation results in an attractive

force between your finger and the charged object. The force that a charged

ruler exerts on neutral pieces of paper is the result of the same process, the

separation of charges.
The negative charges at the bottom of thunderclouds also can cause
charge separation in Earth. Positive charges in the ground are attracted to

EarthÕs surface under the cloud. The forces of the charges in the cloud and

those on EarthÕs surface can break molecules into positively and negatively

charged particles. These charged particles are free to move, and they establish

a conducting path from the ground to the cloud. The lightning that you

observe occurs when a bolt travels at speeds on the order of 500,000 km/h

along the conducting path and discharges the cloud.Figure 20-6
An electroscope is a device used for detecting
charges. In a neutral electroscope,

the leaves hang loosely, almost
touching one another.

are touching, as shown in 
Figure 20-8a.
When a negatively charged rod is
brought close to one, as in 
Figure 20-8b,
electrons from the first sphere willbe forced onto the sphere farther from the rod and will make it negatively
charged. The closer sphere is now positively charged. If the spheres are 

separated while the rod is nearby, each sphere will have a charge, and the

charges will be equal but opposite, as shown in 
Figure 20-8c.
This processof charging an object without touching it is called charging by induction.
A single object can be charged by induction through 
grounding,whichis the process of connecting a body to Earth to eliminate excess charge.
Earth is a very large sphere, and it can absorb great amounts of charge

without becoming noticeably charged itself. If a charged body is touched
to Earth, almost any amount of charge can flow to Earth.
If a negatively charged rod is brought close to the knob of an electro-
scope, as in 
Figure 20-9a,
electrons are repelled onto the leaves. If the
knob is then grounded on the side opposite the charged rod, electrons will
be pushed from the electroscope into the ground until the leaves are 

neutral, as in Figure 20-9b.
Removing the ground before the rod leaves the
electroscope with a deficit of electrons, and it will be positively charged, as

in Figure 20-9c.
Grounding also can be used as a source of electrons. If a
positive rod is brought near the knob of a grounded electroscope, electrons

will be attracted from the ground, and the electroscope will obtain a 
negative charge. When this process is employed, the charge induced on 

the electroscope is opposite that of the object used to charge it. Because the
rod never touches the electroscope, its charge is not transferred, and it can

be used many times to charge objects by induction.

You have seen that a force acts between two or more charged objects. In
your experiments with tape, you found that the force depends on 
distance. 
The closer you brought the charged comb to the tape, the stronger
the force was. You also found that the more you charged the comb, the

stronger the force was. How can you vary the quantity of charge in a con-

trolled way? This problem was solved in 1785 by French physicist Charles

Coulomb. The type of apparatus used by Coulomb is shown in 
Figure 20-10.
An insulating rod with small conducting spheres, A and A
, at each end was
suspended by a thin wire. A similar sphere, B, was placed in contact with

sphere A. When they were touched with a charged object, the charge spread

evenly over the two spheres. Because they were the same size, they received

equal amounts of charge. The symbol for charge is 
q. Therefore, the amount
of charge on the spheres can be represented by the notation 
qAand qB.Force depends on distance
Coulomb found how the force between the
two charged spheres depended on the distance. First, he carefully meas-

ured the amount of force needed to twist the suspending wire through a
given angle. He then placed equal charges on spheres A and B and varied

the distance, 
r, between them. The force moved A, which twisted the sus-
pending wire. By measuring the deflection of A, Coulomb could calculate

the force of repulsion. He showed that the force, 
F, varied inversely with
the square of the distance between the centers of the spheres.
Fr12Force depends on charge
To investigate the way in which the force
depended on the amount of charge, Coulomb had to change the charges

on the spheres in a measured way. He first charged spheres A and B equally,

as before. Then he selected an uncharged sphere, C, of the same size as

sphere B. When C was placed in contact with B, the spheres shared the

charge that had been on B alone. Because the two were the same size, B

then had only half of its original charge. Therefore, the charge on B was

only one-half the charge on A. After Coulomb adjusted the position of B
so that the distance, 
r, between A and B was the same as before, he found
that the force between A and B was half of its former value. That is, he

found that the force varied directly with the charge of the bodies.
FqAqBAfter many similar measurements, Coulomb summarized the results in
a law now known as 
CoulombÕs law:
the magnitude of the force between
charge qAand charge qB, separated by a distance 
r, is proportional to themagnitude of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the

distance between them.
FqAr2qBThe unit of charge: the coulomb
The amount of charge that an object hasis difficult to measure directly. CoulombÕs experiments, however, showed

that the quantity of charge could be related to force. Thus, Coulomb could

define a standard quantity of charge in terms of the amount of force 
that it produces. The SI standard unit of charge is called the 
coulomb(C).Section 20.2Electric Force

550Chapter 20Static Electricity
abOne coulomb is the charge of 6.241018electrons or protons. A typical
lightning bolt can carry 5 C to 25 C of charge. The charge on a single elec-
tron is 1.601019C. The magnitude of the charge of an electron is calledthe elementary charge.
Even small pieces of matter, such as coins, contain
up to 10
6C of negative charge. This enormous amount of negative charge
produces almost no external effects because it is balanced by an equal

amount of positive charge. If the charge is unbalanced, even as small a

charge as 10
9C can result in large forces.
According to CoulombÕs law, the magnitude of the force on charge 
qAcaused by charge 
qBa distance raway can be written as follows.
When the charges are measured in coulombs, the distance in meters, and

the force in newtons, the constant, 
K, is 9.0109Nm2/C2.The CoulombÕs law equation gives the magnitude of the force that
charge qAexerts on qBand also the force that qBexerts on qA. These two
forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. You can observe

this example of NewtonÕs third law of motion in action when you bring

two strips of tape with like charges together. Each exerts forces on the

other. If you bring a charged comb near either strip of tape, the strip, with

its small mass, moves readily. The acceleration of the comb and you is, of

course, much less because of the much greater mass.
The electric force, like all other forces, is a vector quantity. Force vectors
need both a magnitude and a direction. However, the CoulombÕs law

equation above gives only the magnitude of the force. To determine the

direction, you need to draw a diagram and interpret charge relations care-

fully. If two positively charged objects, A and B, are brought near, the forces

they exert on each other are repulsive, as shown in 
Figure 20-11a.
If, instead,B is negatively charged, the forces are attractive, as shown in 
Figure 20-11b.
CoulombÕs Law
FKqAr2qBThe force between two charges is equal to CoulombÕs constant, times the
product of the two charges, divided by the square of the distance between them.

law is valid only for point charges or uniform spherical charge distribu-
tions. That is, a charged sphere may be treated as if all the charge were

located at its center if the charge is spread evenly across its entire surface or

throughout its volume. If a sphere is a conductor and another charge is

brought near it, the charges on the sphere will be attracted or repelled, and
the charge no longer will act as if it were at the sphereÕs center. Therefore,

it is important to consider how large and how far apart two charged

spheres are before applying CoulombÕs law. The problems in this textbook

assume that charged spheres are small enough and far enough apart to be
considered point charges unless otherwise noted. When shapes such as
long wires or flat plates are considered, CoulombÕs law must be modified

to account for the nonpoint charge distributions.

page so that a precise reproduction of the original document is made. In

other instances, applications are concerned with the control of static

charge. For example, static charge can ruin film if it attracts dust, and elec-

tronic equipment can be damaged by the discharge of static charge. In

these cases, applications are designed to avoid the buildup of static charge

and to safely eliminate any charge that does build up.

Spacecraft and Static Electricity
Most objects on Earthdo not build upsubstantial static-electric charges because alayer of moisture clings to surfaces, allowing

charges to migrate to or from the ground. As
you learned in this chapter, Earth can absorb

almost any amount of charge. However, there

is no moisture in space, and Earth is far 
away.
Charged particles ejected from the Sun, or in
the ionosphere, strike and cling to spacecraft,

charging their surfaces to thousands of volts.
Plasma and ChargingIn Chapter 13, you learned

that plasma consists of free
electrons and positive ions.

Orbiting spacecraft are sur-
rounded by a thin cloud of

this plasma. The electrons
in plasma can move far

more easily than more
massive positive ions.

Thus, spacecraft surfaces

tend to attract electrons
and develop a negative

charge. This negative charge

eventually attracts some heavy

positive ions, which strike 

the spacecraft and can damage
its surface.
On the International SpaceStation,an additional diffi-culty stems from the array 

of solar panels that convert

energy from the Sun into 
electricity. When the arrays are

powering the space station,

the voltage on the surface of

the craft tends to be close to
the voltage of the solar array.

As a result, it is possible that
an electric arc could form
between the space station and

the plasma that surrounds it.Consequences of an ArcArcs areextremely hot and carry a great deal of current.
They can prematurely ignite retro-rockets or
explosive bolts and interfere with the operation

of the spacecraftÕs electronic equipment. The

solar panels are particularly susceptible to 
arc damage. In addition to damage to the
spacecraftÕs components, there is a remote

chance that the buildup of charge might
endanger astronauts on space walks.
To discharge the potential difference and
protect craft and crew, the space stationÕs skin

must be connected by a conductor, called a

plasma contactor, to the plasma cloud sur-

rounding it. The connection begins on board
the station, where a stream of xenon gas from
a tank in the Plasma Contactor Unit (PCU) isionized by an electric current.

This ionization takes place in
the cathode assembly. The 

ionized xenon, now in the

plasma state, passes out of 

the craft through the cathode
assembly. It is this stream of

conductive plasma that connects

the craft to the surrounding
plasma cloud, thereby reducing

the potential difference to safe
levels.
Future ApplicationsFuture spacecraft might 
integrate the plasma contac-
tor into the propulsion 
system. For example, the

Variable Specific Impulse

Magnetoplasma Rocket

(VASIMR) could use the

plasma exhaust that it pro-
duces to provide an electric

connection between the

spacecraft and the surround-
ing plasma. Scientists think
that this type of rocket could
be used in the future to 
travel between planets.

Key Concepts
¥There are two kinds of electric charge, positive and negative. Interactions of
these charges explain the attraction and repulsion that you observed in the

strips of tape.
¥Electric charge is not created or destroyed; it is conserved. Charging is the

separation, not creation, of electric charges.
¥Objects can be charged by the transfer of electrons. An area with excess

electrons has a net negative charge; an area with a deficit of electrons has 

a net positive charge.
¥Charges added to one part of an insulator remain on that part. Insulators
include glass, dry wood, plastics, and dry air.
¥Charges added to a conductor quickly spread over the surface of the object.

In general, examples of conductors include graphite, metals, and matter in

the plasma state.
¥Under certain conditions, charges can move through a substance that is

ordinarily an insulator. Lightning moving through air is one example.
Key Concepts
¥When an electroscope is charged, electric forces cause its thin metal leaves 

to spread apart.¥An object can be charged by conduction by touching it with a charged object.
¥A charged object will induce a separation of charges within a neutral
conductor. This process will result in an attractive force between the charged

object and the neutral conductor.
¥To charge a conductor by induction, a charged object is first brought near it,

causing a separation of charges. Then, the conductor to be charged is

separated, trapping opposite charges on the two halves.
¥Grounding is the removal of excess charge by touching an object to Earth.

Grounding can be used in the process of charging an electroscope by

induction.¥CoulombÕs law states that the force between two charged particles varies

directly with the product of their charges and inversely with the square of

the distance between them. 
To determine the direction of the force, remember the following rule: like
charges repel; unlike charges attract.¥The SI unit of charge is the coulomb. One coulomb (C) is the magnitude 

of the charge of 6.241018electrons or protons. The elementary charge, 
the charge of a proton or electron, is 1.601019C.FKqAr2qB557physicspp.com/vocabulary_puzzlemaker

Vocabulary
electric fieldelectric field lineElectric force, like gravitational force, which you studied in Chapter 8,

varies inversely as the square of the distance between two point
objects. Both forces can act from great distances. How can a force be

exerted across what seems to be empty space? Michael Faraday suggested

that because an electrically charged object, A, creates a force on another
charged object, B, anywhere in space, object A must somehow change the

properties of space. Object B somehow senses the change in space and

experiences a force due to the properties of the space at its location. We call

the changed property of space an electric field.An electric field meansthat the interaction is not between two distant objects, but between an

object and the field at its location.The forces exerted by electric fields can do work, transferring energy
from the field to another charged object. This energy is something you use

on a daily basis, whether you plug an appliance into an electric outlet or

use a battery-powered, portable device. In this chapter, you will learn more

about electric fields, forces, and electric energy.
Section 21.1Creating and Measuring Electric Fields
563Horizons Companies 562-568 CH21-S1-845813  3/18/04  9:56 PM  Page 563The Electric Field
How can you measure an electric field? Place a small charged object at
some location. If there is an electric force on it, then there is an electric fieldat that point. The charge on the object that is used to test the field, called
the test charge, must be small enough that it doesnÕt affect other charges.
Consider Figure 21-1,
which illustrates a charged object with a charge ofq. Suppose you place the positive test charge at some point, A, and measure
a force, 
F. According to CoulombÕs law, the force is directly proportional to
the strength of the test charge, 
q. That is, if the charge is doubled, so is the
force. Therefore, the ratio of the force to the charge is a constant. If you

divide the force, 
F, by the test charge, 
q, you obtain a vector quantity, 
F/q.This quantity does not depend on the test charge, only on the force, 
F, andthe location of point A. The electric field at point A, the location of q, isrepresented by the following equation. 
The direction of an electric field is the direction of the force on a positive
test charge. The magnitude of the electric field strength is measured in

newtons per coulomb, N/C.
A picture of an electric field can be made by using arrows to represent
the field vectors at various locations, as shown in Figure 21-1. The length

of the arrow is used to show the strength of the field. The direction of the

arrow shows the field direction. To find the field from two charges, the

fields from the individual charges are added vectorially. A test charge can

be used to map out the field resulting from any collection of charges.

Typical electric field strengths produced by charge collections are shown in

Table 21-1.
An electric field should be measured only by a very small test charge.
This is because the test charge also exerts a force on q. It is important thatthe force exerted by the test charge does not cause charge to be redistrib-

uted on a conductor, thereby causing 
qto move to another location and
thus, changing the force on 
qas well as the electric field strength being
measured. A test charge always should be small enough so that its effect on

qis negligible.
Electric Field StrenghEFoqnqThe strength of an electric field is equal to the force on a positive test charge
divided by the strength of the test charge.

Lines of force are
drawn perpendicularly away froma positively charged object (a)and perpendicularly into a
negatively charged object (b).Electric field lines are shown

between like charged andoppositely charged objects 
(c).So far, you have measured an electric field at a single point. Now, imag-
ine moving the test charge to another location. Measure the force on it

again and calculate the electric field. Repeat this process again and again

until you assign every location in space a measurement of the vector quan-

tity of the electric field strength associated with it. The field is present even

if there is no test charge to measure it. Any charge placed in an electric field

experiences a force on it resulting from the electric field at that location.
The strength of the force depends on the magnitude of the field, E, and themagnitude of the charge, 
q. Thus, 
FEq. The direction of the forcedepends on the direction of the field and the sign of the charge.
Picturing the Electric Field
A picture of an electric field is shown in 
Figure 21-2.
Each of the linesused to represent the actual field in the space around a charge is called an
electric field line.
The direction of the field at any point is the tangent
drawn to a field line at that point. The strength of the electric field is indi-

cated by the spacing between the lines. The field is strong where the lines

are close together. It is weaker where the lines are spaced farther apart.

Although only two-dimensional models can be shown here, remember

that electric fields exist in three dimensions.
The direction of the force on a positive test charge near another positive
charge is away from the other charge. Thus, the field lines extend radially

outward like the spokes of a wheel, as shown in 
Figure 21-2a.
Near a negative charge, the direction of the

force on the positive test charge is

toward the negative charge, so the

field lines point radially inward, as

shown in 
Figure 21-2b.
Whenthere are two or more charges, the

field is the vector sum of the fields

resulting from the individual
charges. The field lines become

curved and the pattern is more

complex, as shown in 
Figure 21-2c.
Note that field lines always leave a

positive charge and enter a negative

charge, and that they never cross

each other.

dRobert Van de Graaff devised the high-voltage electrostatic generator in
the 1930s. Van de GraaffÕs machine, shown in 
Figure 21-3a
on the previ-ous page, is a device that transfers large amounts of charge from one part
of the machine to a metal terminal at the top of the device. Charge is trans-

ferred onto a moving belt at the base of the generator, position A, and is

transferred off the belt at the metal dome at the top, position B. An elec-

tric motor does the work needed to increase the electric potential energy.

A person touching the terminal of a Van 
de Graaff machine is charged elec-trically. The charges on the personÕs ha
irs repel each other, causing the hairs
to follow the field lines, as shown in 
Figure 21-3b. 
Another method of visualizing field lines is to use grass seed in an insu-lating liquid, such as mineral oil. The electric forces cause a separation of
charge in each long, thin grass seed. The seeds then turn so that they line
up along the direction of the electric field. The seeds thus form a pattern
of the electric field lines, as in 
Figure 21-4.
Field lines do not really exist.They are simply a means of providing a model of an electric field. Electric

fields, on the other hand, do exist. Although they provide a method of 

calculating the force on a charged body, they do not explain why charged

bodies exert forces on each other.

energyEBAAs you have learned, the concept of energy is extremely useful in 
mechanics. The law of conservation of energy allows us to solve
motion problems without knowing the forces in detail. The same is true in
the study of electrical interactions. The work performed moving a charged

particle in an electric field can result in the particleÕs gaining potential, or

kinetic energy, or both. Because this chapter investigates charges at rest,

only changes in potential energy will be discussed.Energy and Electric Potential
Recall the change in gravitational potential energy of a ball when it is
lifted, as shown in 
Figure 21-5.
Both the gravitational force, 
F, and thegravitational field, 
gF/m, point toward Earth. If you lift a ball against the
force of gravity, you do work on it, thereby increasing its potential energy.
The situation is similar with two unlike charges: they attract each other,
and so you must do work to pull one charge away from the other. When

you do the work, you transfer energy to the charge where that energy is

stored as potential energy. The larger the test charge, the greater the

increase in its potential energy, 
PE.Although the force on the test charge depends on its magnitude, 
q, theelectric field it experiences does not. The electric field, EF/q, is the forceper unit charge. In a similar way, the 
electric potential difference,
V, isdefined as the work done moving a positive test charge between two points

in an electric field divided by the magnitude of the test charge. 
Electric potential difference is measured in joules per coulomb. One joule
per coulomb is called a volt
(J/C V).Consider the situation shown in 
Figure 21-6
on the next page. The nega-
tive charge creates an electric field toward itself. Suppose you place a small

positive test charge in the field at position A. It will experience a force in 

the direction of the field. If you now mo
ve the test charge away from the 
negative charge to position B, as in 
Figure21-6a,
you will have to exert a force, 
F, onthe charge. Because the force that you exert

is in the same direction as the displacement,
the work that you do on the test charge is

positive. Therefore, there also will be a pos-

itive change in the electric potential differ-

ence. The change in potential difference

does not depend on the magnitude of the
test charge. It depends only on the field and

the displacement.Electric Potential Difference
VWqonqThe difference in electrical potential is the ratio of the work needed to move
a charge to the strength of that charge.abFigure 21-5

Electric potentialdifference is determined bymeasuring the work per unit
charge. If you move unlike charges

apart, you increase the electric

potential difference (a).If youmove unlike charges closer

together, you reduce the electric
potential difference (b).Figure 21-7
Electric potential issmaller when two unlike charges

are closer together (a)and largerwhen two like charges are closer

personal computers, contain

components that are easily

damaged by static electric

discharges. To prevent damage 

to these sensitive components

during repair, a technician will

wear a conductive strap around
his or her wrist. The other end of

this strap is clipped to a grounded
piece of metal. The strap conducts

charge away from the technician
and eliminates any possible

potential difference with the
grounded equipment.Suppose you now move the test charge back to position A from position
B, as in Figure 21-6b.
The force that you exert is now in the direction
opposite the displacement, so the work that you do is negative. The elec-

tric potential difference is also negative. In fact, it is equal and opposite to

the potential difference for the move from position A to position B. The

electric potential difference does not depend on the path used to go from
one position to another. It does depend on the two positions.
Is there always an electric potential difference between the two posi-
tions? Suppose you move the test charge in a circle around the negative

charge. The force that the electric field exerts on the test charge is always

perpendicular to the direction in which you moved it, so you do no work.

Therefore, the electric potential difference is zero. Whenever the electric

potential difference between two or more positions is zero, those positions

are said to be at equipotential.Only differences in potential energy can be measured. The same is trueof electric potential; thus, only differences in electric potential are impor-

tant. The electric potential difference from point A to point B is defined as
VVBVA. Electric potential differences are measured with a voltmeter.
Sometimes, the electric potential difference is simply called the voltage. Do

not confuse electric potential difference, 
V, with the unit for volts, V.

20.A potential difference of 275 V is applied to two parallel plates that are 0.35 cm apart.

What is the electric field between the plates?
You have seen that electric potential difference increases as a positive
test charge is separated from a negative charge. What happens when a pos-
itive test charge is separated from a positive charge? There is a repulsive

force between these two charges. Potential energy decreases as the two

charges are moved farther apart. Therefore, the electric potential is smaller

at points farther from the positive charge, as shown in 
Figure 21-7.
As you learned in Chapter 11, the potential energy of a system can be
defined as zero at any reference point. In the same way, the electric poten-

tial of any point can be defined as zero. No matter what reference point is

chosen, the value of the electric potential difference from point A to point

B always will be the same.
The Electric Potential in a Uniform Field
A uniform electric force and field can be made by placing two large, flat,
conducting plates parallel to each other. One is charged positively and the

other is charged negatively. The electric field between the plates is constant,

except at the edges of the plates, and its direction is from the positive to

the negative plate. The pattern formed by the grass seeds pictured in 
Figure21-8
represents the electric field between parallel plates.
If a positive test charge, 
q, is moved a distance, 
d, in the direction oppo-site the electric field direction, the work done is found by the relationship

Won qFd. Thus, the electric potential difference, the work done per unit
charge, is 
V= Fd/q(F/q)d. Now, the electric field intensity is the force
per unit charge, 
EF/q. Therefore, the electric potential difference, 
V,between two points a distance, 
d, apart in a uniform field, E, is representedby the following equation. 
The electric potential increases in the direction opposite the electric fielddirection. That is, the electric potential is higher near the positively charged

plate. By dimensional analysis, the product of the units of 
Eand d is(N/C)(m). This is equivalent to one J/C, which is the definition of 1 V. 
Electric Potential Difference in a Uniform Field
VEdThe electrical potential difference in a uniform field is equal to the product of
electric field intensity and the distance moved by a charge.

One important application of the uniform electric field between two
parallel plates is the measurement of the charge of an electron. This first was determined by American physicist Robert A. Millikan in 1909.

Figure 21-9
shows the method used by Millikan to measure the charge car-
ried by a single electron. First, fine oil drops were sprayed from an atom-

izer into the air. These drops were charged by friction with the atomizer as

they were sprayed. Gravity acting on the drops caused them to fall, and a

few of them entered the hole in the top plate of the apparatus. An electric

potential difference then was placed across the two plates. The resulting

electric field between the plates exerted a force on the charged drops. When

the top plate was made positive enough, the electric force caused nega-

tively charged drops to rise. The electric potential difference between the

plates was adjusted to suspend a charged drop between the plates. At this

point, the downward force of EarthÕs gravitational field and the upward

force of the electric field were equal in magnitude. 
The magnitude of the electric field, E, was determined from the electric
potential difference between the plates. A second measurement had to be

made to find the weight of the drop using the relationship 
mg, which was
too tiny to measure by ordinary methods. To make this measurement, a

drop first was suspended. Then, the electric field was turned off, and the

rate of the fall of the drop was measured. Because of friction with the 

air molecules, the oil drop quickly reached terminal velocity, which 

was related to the mass of the drop by a complex equation. Using the

measured terminal velocity to calculate 
mgand knowing 
E, the charge, 
q,could be calculated.Charge on an electron
Millikan found that there was a great deal of vari-
ation in the charges of the drops. When he used X rays to ionize the air and
add or remove electrons from the drops, he noted, however, that the changes

in the charge on the drops were always a multiple of 1.60
1019C. Thechanges were caused by one or more electrons being added to or removed

from the drops. Millikan concluded that the smallest change in charge that

could occur was the amount of charge of one electron. Therefore, Millikan

proposed that each electron always has the same charge, 1.60
1019C.MillikanÕs experiment showed that charge is quantized. This means that 

an object can have only a charge with a magnitude that is some integral

multiple of the charge of an electron. Section 21.2Applications of Electric Fields

All systems come to equilibrium when the energy of the system is at a
minimum. For example, if a ball is placed on a hill, it finally will come to
rest in a valley where its gravitational potential energy is smallest. This also

would be the location where its gravitational potential has been reduced

by the largest amount. This same principle explains what happens when

an insulated, positively charged metal sphere, such as the one shown in

Figure 21-10,
touches a second, uncharged sphere.
The excess charges on sphere A repel each other, so when the neutral
sphere, B, touches sphere A, there is a net force on the charges on A toward

B. Suppose that you were to physically move the charges, individually,

from A to B. When you move the first charge, the other charges on A would

push it toward B, so, to control its speed, you would have to exert a force

in the opposite direction. Therefore, you do negative work on it, and the

electric potential difference from A to B is negative. When the next few

charges are moved, they feel a small repulsive force from the charges

already on B, but there is still a net positive force in that direction. At some

point, the force pushing a charge off A will equal the repulsive force from

the charges on B, and the electric potential difference is zero. After this
point of equilibrium, work would have to be done to move the next charge

to B, so this would not happen by itself and would require an increase in

the energy of the system. However, if you did continue to move charges,

the electric potential difference from A to B would then be positive. Thus,

you can see that charges would move from A to B without external forces

until there is no electric potential difference between the two spheres.
Different sizes of spheres
Suppose that the two spheres have different
sizes, as in 
Figure 21-11.
Although the total numbers of charges on the two
spheres are the same, the larger sphere has a larger surface area, so the
charges can spread farther apart, and the repulsive force between them is

reduced. Thus, if the two spheres now are touched together, there will be a

net force that will move charges from the smaller to the larger sphere. Again,

the charges will move to the sphere with the lower electric potential until

there is no electric potential difference between the two spheres. In this case,

the larger sphere will have a larger charge when equilibrium is reached.

The ground wire
on a fuel truck prevents ignition 
of the gasoline vapors.The same principle explains how charges move on the individual spheres,
or on any conductor. They distribute themselves so that the net force on each
charge is zero. With no force, there is no electric field along the surface of the

conductor. Thus, there is no electric potential difference anywhere on the

surface. The surface of a conductor is, therefore, an equipotential surface.
If a charged body is grounded by touching Earth, almost any amount of
charge can flow to Earth until the electric potential difference between that

body and Earth is reduced to zero. Gasoline trucks, for example, can

become charged by friction. If the charge on a gasoline truck were to jump

to Earth through gasoline vapor, it could cause an explosion. To prevent

this, a metal wire on the truck safely conducts the charge to the ground, 

as shown in 
Figure 21-12.
Similarly, if a computer is not grounded, an
electric potential difference between the computer and 
Earth can occur. If a
person then touches the computer, charges 
could flow 
through the computerto the person and damage the equipment or hurt the person.Electric Fields Near Conductors
The charges on a conductor are spread as far apart as they can be tomake the energy of the system as low as possible. The result is that all

charges are on the surface of a solid conductor. If the conductor is hollow,

excess charges will move to the outer surface. If a closed metal container is

charged, there will be no charges on the inside surfaces of the container. In

this way, a closed metal container shields the inside from electric fields. For

example, people inside a car are protected from the electric fields generated

by lightning. Likewise, on an open coffee can, there will be very few

charges inside and none near the bottom. Even if the inner surface of an

object is pitted or bumpy, giving it a larger surface area than the outer sur-

face, the charge still will be entirely on the outside.
On the outside of a conductor, however, the electric field often is not
zero. Even though the surface of a conductor is at an equipotential, the

electric field around the outside of it depends on the shape of the conduc-
tor, as well as on the electric potential difference between it and Earth. The

charges are closer together at sharp points of a conductor, as indicated in

Figure 21-13.
Therefore, the field lines are closer together and the field is
stronger. This field can become so strong that when electrons are knocked

off of atoms by passing cosmic rays, the electrons and resulting ions are

accelerated by the field, causing them to strike other atoms, resulting in more

ionization of atoms. This chain reaction is what results in the pink glow,

Tim Courlas
569-579 CH21-S2-845813  3/18/04  10:08 PM  Page 576such as that seen inside a gas-discharge sphere. If the field is strong enough,
when the particles hit other molecules they will produce a stream of ions
and electrons that form a plasma, which is a conductor. The result is a

spark, or, in extreme cases, lightning. To reduce discharges and sparking,

conductors that are highly charged or that operate at high potentials are
made smooth in shape to reduce the electric fields.
In contrast, a lightning rod is pointed so that the electric field will bestrong near the end of the rod. As the field accelerates electrons and ions,

they form the start of a conducting path from the rod to the clouds. As a

result of the rodÕs sharply pointed shape, charges in the clouds spark to the

rod, rather than to a chimney or other high point on a house or other
building. From the rod, a conductor takes the charges safely to the ground.Lightning usually requires a potential difference of millions of volts
between Earth and the clouds. Even a small gas-discharge tube operates at

several thousand volts. Household wiring, on the other hand, does not nor-

mally carry a high enough potential difference to cause such discharges.
Storing Charges: The Capacitor
When you lift a book, you increase its gravitational potential energy.
This can be interpreted as storing energy in a gravitational field. In a simi-

lar way, you can store energy in an electric field. In 1746, Dutch physician

and physicist Pieter Van Musschenbroek invented a small device that could

store a large electric charge. In honor of the city in which he worked, it was

called a Leyden jar. Benjamin Franklin used a Leyden jar to store the charge

from lightning and in many other experiments. A version of the Leyden jar

is still in use today in electric equipment. This new device for storing a

charge has a new form, is much smaller in size, and is called a 
capacitor.
As charge is added to an object, the electric potential difference between
that object and Earth increases. For a given shape and size of an object, the

ratio of charge stored to electric potential difference, 
q/V, is a constantcalled the capacitance,
C. For a small sphere far from the ground, even a
small amount of added charge will increase the electric potential differ-
ence. Thus, 
Cis small. A larger sphere can hold more charge for the sameincrease in electric potential difference, and its capacitance is larger. 
Capacitors are designed to have specific capacitances. All capacitors are
made up of two conductors that are separated by an insulator. The two

conductors have equal and opposite charges. Capacitors are used today in

electric circuits to store charge. Commercial capacitors, such as those

shown in 
Figure 21-14,
typically contain strips of aluminum foil separatedby thin plastic that are tightly rolled up to conserve space.
The capacitance of a capacitor is independent of the charge on it, andcan be measured by first placing charge 
qon one plate and charge qonthe other, and then measuring the electric potential difference, 
V, thatresults. The capacitance is found by using the following equation, and is

measured in farads, F. 
CapacitanceCqVCapacitance is the ratio of charge on one plate to potential difference.

One farad, F, named after Michael
Faraday, is one coulomb per volt, C/V. Just as 1 C is a large amount of
charge, 1 F is also a fairly large capacitance. Most capacitors used in mod-

ern electronics have capacitances between 10 picofarads (10
1012F) and500 microfarads (500
106F). However, memory capacitors that are used
to prevent loss of memory in some computers can have capacitance from

0.5 F to 1.0 F. Note that if the charge is increased, the electric potential dif-

ference also increases. The capacitance depends only on the construction

of the capacitor, not on the charge,

Varieties of capacitors
Capacitors have many shapes and sizes, as shown
in Figure 21-14. Some are large enough to fill whole rooms and can store
enough charge to create artificial lightning or power giant lasers that

release thousands of joules of energy in a few billionths of a second.
Capacitors in television sets can store enough charge at several hundred

volts to be very dangerous if they are touched. These capacitors can remain

charged for hours after the televisions have been turned off. This is why 

you should not open the case of a television or a computer monitor even

if it is unplugged.The capacitance of a capacitor is controlled by varying the surface area
of the two conductors, or plates, within a capacitor, by the distance

between the plates, and by the nature of the insulating material. Capacitors

are named for the type of insulator, or dielectric, used to separate the

plates, and include ceramic, mica, polyester, paper, and air. Higher capaci-

tance is obtained by increasing the surface area and decreasing the separa-

tion of the plates. Certain dielectrics have the ability to effectively offset

some of the charge on the plates and allow more charge to be stored. 
The plates of a capacitor attract each other because they carry opposite charges.

d569-579 CH21-S2-845813  3/18/04  10:11 PM  Page 579580Charging of CapacitorsA capacitor is an electric device that is made from two conductors, or plates, that
are separated by an insulator. It is designed to have a specific capacitance. The

capacitance depends on the physical characteristics and geometric arrangement 

of the conductors and the insulator. In the circuit schematic, the capacitor appears

to create an open circuit, even when the switch is in the closed position. However,

because capacitors store charge, when the switch is closed, charge from the battery

will move to the capacitor. The equal, but opposite charges on the two plates

within the capacitor establishes a potential difference, or voltage. As charge is

added to the capacitor, the electric potential difference increases. In this labora-

tory activity you will examine the charging of several different capacitors.

Do not attach the battery at this time. 

CAUTION: Be careful to avoid a short circuit,

especially by permitting the leads from the

battery clip to touch each other.
Connect the circuit, as illustrated. Do this by connecting
either end of the resistor to one side of the

switch. The resistor is used to reduce the

charging of the capacitor to a measurable rate.

Connect the other end of the resistor to the

negative side of the 9-V battery clip. Inspect

your 1000-F capacitor to determine whether
either end is marked with a negative sign, or an
arrow with negative signs on it, that points to

the lead that is to be connected to the negative
side of the battery. Connect this negative lead

to the other side of the switch. Attach the

unconnected (positive) lead of the capacitor 

to the positive lead from the battery clip. 2.Connect the positive terminal of the voltmeter
to the positive side of the capacitor and the

negative terminal to the negative side of the
capacitor. Compare your circuit to the photo 

to verify your connections. Attach the battery

after your teacher has inspected the circuit.3.Prepare a data table having columns for time

and potential difference on each of the three
different capacitors.

should record potential difference at the desig-

observed behavior.
2.Make and Use Graphs
Prepare a graph that
plots the time horizontally and the potential dif-

ference vertically. Make a separate labeled line

for each capacitor. 
1.Interpret Data
Does the voltage on the
capacitor immediately jump to the batteryÕs

potential difference (9-V)? Explain the reason

for the observed behavior.
2.Infer
Does the larger capacitor require a
longer time to become fully charged? Explain
why or why not.1.The time for a capacitor to charge to the volt-

age of the battery depends upon its capaci-

tance and the opposition to the flow of charge

in the circuit. In this lab, the opposition to the
flow of charge was controlled by the 47-k
resistor that was placed in the circuit. In circuits

with a capacitor and resistance, such as in 

this activity, the time in seconds to charge the

capacitor to 63.3 percent of the applied voltage

is equal to the product of the capacitor and

resistance. This is called the time constant.

Therefore,

2.Compare your time constants to the values

Positive charges spark out from the

Lightning Rods
Lightning can be very destructive because it creates
huge currents in materials that are poor conductors
and generates a great deal of heat. In addition to
protecting a structure by dissipating some of the

charge before lightning strikes, lightning rods are

excellent conductors that provide a safe path for

the current. Benjamin Franklin is credited with
inventing the lightning rod in the 1750s.

Key Concepts
¥An electric field exists around any charged object. The field produces forces
on other charged objects.
¥The electric field is the force per unit charge. 
¥The direction of the electric field is the direction of the force on a tiny,

positive test charge.
¥Electric field lines provide a picture of the electric field. They are directed

away 
from positive charges and toward negative charges. They never cross,
and their density is related to the strength of the field.EqFKey Concepts
¥Electric potential difference is the change in potential energy per unit charge
in an electric field.¥Electric potential differences are measured in volts.
¥The electric field between two parallel plates is uniform between the plates,

except near the edges. In a uniform field, the potential difference is related

to the field strength by the following.
¥Robert MillikanÕs experiments showed that electric charge is quantized. 
¥Robert Millikan also showed that the negative charge carried by an electron

is 1.601019C.¥Charges will move in a conductor until the electric potential is the same

everywhere on the conductor.
¥Grounding makes the potential difference between an object and Earth

equal to zero.¥Grounding can prevent sparks resulting from a neutral object making

contact with objects that have built-up charge on them.
¥Electric fields are strongest near sharply pointed conductors.
¥Capacitance is the ratio of the charge on an object to its electric potential
difference.
¥Capacitance is independent of the charge on an object and the electric
potential difference across it.¥Capacitors are used to store charge.

As you learned in Chapter 11, flowing water at the top of a waterfall  
has both potential and kinetic energy. However, the large amount of
natural potential and kinetic energy available from resources such as
Niagara Falls are of little use to people or manufacturers who are 100 km

away, 
unless that energy can be transported efficiently. Electric energy pro-
vides the means to transfer large quantities of energy great distances with
little loss. This transfer usually is done at high potential differences through

power lines, such as those shown in the photo on the left. Once this energy

reaches the consumer, it can easily 
be converted 
into another form or com-bination of forms, including sound, 
light, thermal energy, and motion.
Because electric energy can so easily be changed into other forms, it has
become indispensable in our daily lives. Even quick glances around you

will likely generate ample examples of the conversion of electric energy.

Inside, lights to help you read at night, microwaves and electric ranges to

cook food, computers, and stereos all rely on electricity for power. Outside,

street lamps, store signs, advertisements, and the starters in cars all use

flowing electric charges. In this chapter, you will learn how potential 

differences, resistance, and current are related. You also will learn about

electric power and energy transfer.

Producing Electric Current
In Chapter 21, you learned that when two conducting spheres touch,
charges flow from the sphere at a higher potential to the one at a lower
potential. The flow continues until there is no potential difference between

the two spheres.
A flow of charged particles is an 
electric current.In Figure 22-1a,two
conductors, A and B, are connected by a wire conductor, C. Charges flow

from the higher potential difference of B to A through C. This flow of pos-

itive charge is called 
conventional current.
The flow stops when the
potential difference between A, B, and C is zero. You could maintain the

electric potential difference between B and A by pumping charged particles

from A back to B, as illustrated in Figure 22-1b.
Since the pump increasesthe electric potential energy of the charges, it requires an external energysource to run. This energy could come from a variety of 
sources. One famil-
iar source, a voltaic or galvanic cell (a common dry cell), converts chemical

energy to electric energy. Several galvanic cells connected together are

called a battery.
A second source of electric energyÑa photovoltaic cell, or
solar cellÑchanges light energy into electric energy. 
Electric Circuits
The charges in Figure 22-1b move around a closed loop, cycling from the
pump to B, through C, to A and back to the pump. Any closed loop or 

conducting path allowing electric charges to flow is called an 
electric circuit.A circuit includes a charge pump, which increases the potential energy of 
the charges flowing from A to B, and a device that reduces the potential

energy of the charges flowing from B to A. The potential energy lost by the

charges, 
qV, moving through the device is usually converted into some other
form of energy. For example, electric energy is converted to kinetic energy by

a motor, to light energy by a lamp, and to thermal energy by a heater. 
A charge pump creates the flow of charged particles that make up a cur-
rent. Consider a generator driven by 
a waterwheel, such 
as the one picturedin Figure 22-2a.The water falls and rotates the waterwheel and generator.
Thus, the kinetic energy of the water is converted to electric energy by the

generator. The generator, like the charge pump, increases the electric

potential difference, 
V. Energy in the amount qVis needed to increase thepotential difference of the charges. This energy comes from the change in

energy of the water. Not all of the waterÕs kinetic energy, however, is con-

verted to electric energy, as shown in 
Figure 22-2b.
If the generator attached to the waterwheel is connected to a
motor, the charges in the wire flow into the motor. The flow of

charges continues through the circuit back to the generator. The

motor converts electric energy to kinetic energy.
Conservation of charge
Charges cannot be created or destroyed,
but they can be separated. Thus, the total amount of chargeÑthe
number of negative electrons and positive ionsÑin the circuit

does not change. If one coulomb flows through the generator in

1 s, then one coulomb also will flow through the motor in 1 s.

Thus, charge is a conserved quantity. Energy also is conserved. The

change in electric energy, 
E, equals qV. Because qis conserved,

Conventionalcurrent is defined as positivecharges flowing from the positive

plate to the negative plate (a).A generator pumps the positive
charges back to the positive plate

and maintains the current 
(b).Inmost metals, negatively-charged

electrons actually flow from the
negative to the positive plate,
creating the appearance of
positive charges that are moving

in the opposite direction.590-600 CH22-S1-845813  7/22/04  3:38 PM  Page 592Section 22.1Current and Circuits

done bymotor Electricenergythe net change in potential energy of the charges going completely aroundthe circuit must be zero. The increase in potential difference produced by

the generator equals the decrease in potential difference across the motor.
If the potential difference between two wires is 120 V, the waterwheel
and the generator must do 120 J of work on each coulomb of charge that

is delivered. Every coulomb of charge moving through the motor delivers

120 J of energy to the motor.
Rates of Charge Flow and Energy Transfer
Power, which is defined in watts, W, measures the rate at which energy
is transferred. If a generator transfers 1 J of kinetic energy to electric energy
each second, it is transferring energy at the rate of 1 J/s, or 1 W. The energy

carried by an electric current depends on the charge transferred, 
q, and thepotential difference across which it moves, 
V. Thus, 
EqV. Recall from
Chapter 20 that the unit for the quantity of electric charge is the coulomb.

The rate of flow of electric charge,
q/t, called electric current, is measuredin coulombs per second. Electric current is represented by 
I, so Iq/t. Aflow of 1 C/s is called an 
ampere,
A.The energy carried by an electric current is related to the voltage, 
EqV.Since current, Iq/t, is the rate of charge flow, the power, 
PE/t, of anelectric device can be determined by multiplying voltage and current. To

derive the familiar form of the equation for the power delivered to an elec-

tric device, you can use 
PE/tand substitute EqVand qIt.If the current through the motor in Figure 22-2a is 3.0 A and the potential
difference is 120 V, the power in the motor is calculated using the expres-

sion P(3.0C/s)(120 J/C) 
360 J/s, which is 360 W.
Power
PIVPower is equal to the current times the potential difference.

Resistance and Ohm’s Law
Suppose two conductors have a potential difference between them. If
they are connected with a copper rod, a large current is created. On theother hand, putting a glass rod between them creates almost no current.

The property determining how much current will flow is called 
resistance.
Table 22-1
lists some of the factors that impact resistance. Resistance is
measured by placing a potential difference across a conductor and divid-

ing the voltage by the current. The resistance, 
R, is defined as the ratio ofelectric potential difference, 
V, to the current, I.The resistance of the conductor, 
R, is measured inohms. One ohm (1 
) is the resistance permitting an
electric charge of 1 A to flow when a potential differ-

ence of 1 V is applied across the resistance. A simple

circuit relating resistance, current, and voltage is

shown in 
Figure 22-3.A 12-V car battery is connectedto one of the carÕs 3-
brake lights. The circuit is com-
pleted by a connection to an ammeter, which is a

device that measures current. The current carrying the
energy to the lights will measure 4 A.Resistance
RVIResistance is equal to voltage divided by current.

SwitchBatteryMotorPotentiometerSwitchBatteryMotorPotentiometerIIThe unit for resistance is named for German scientist Georg Simon Ohm,who found that the ratio of 
potential difference to current is constant for agiven conductor. The resistance for most conductors does not vary as the
magnitude or direction of the potential applied to it changes. A device hav-

ing constant resistance independent of the potential difference obeys

OhmÕs law.
Most metallic conductors obey OhmÕs law, at least over a limited range of
voltages. Many important devices, however, do not. A radio and a pocket cal-

culator contain many devices, such as transistors and diodes, that do not

obey OhmÕs law. Even a lightbulb has resistance that depends on its tem-

perature and does not obey OhmÕs law.
Wires used to connect electric devices have low resistance. A 1-m length
of a typical wire used in physics labs has a resistance of about 0.03 
.Wires used in home wiring offer as little as 0.004 of resistance for eachmeter of length. Because wires have so little resistance, there is almost no

potential drop across them. To produce greater potential drops, a large

resistance concentrated into a small volume is necessary. A 
resistoris adevice designed to have a specific resistance. Resistors may be made of

graphite, semiconductors, or wires that are long and thin.
There are two ways to control the current in a circuit. Because 
IV/R, Ican be changed by varying 
V, R, or both. Figure 22-4ashows a simple
circuit. When Vis 6 V and Ris 30 
, the current is 0.2 A. How could the
current be reduced to 0.1 A? According to OhmÕs law, the greater the volt-

age placed across a resistor, the larger the current passing through it. If the

current through a resistor is cut in half, the potential difference also is cutFigure 22-5

Biology ConnectionBiology Connectionin half. In Figure 22-4b,
the voltage applied across the resistor is reduced
from 6 V to 3 V to reduce the current to 0.1 A. A second way to reduce the
current to 0.1 A is to replace the 30-
resistor with a 60-resistor, as
shown in 
Figure 22-4c.Resistors often are used to control the current in circuits or parts of cir-
cuits. Sometimes, a smooth, continuous variation of the current is desired.

For example, the speed control on some electric motors allows continuous,

rather than step-by-step, changes in the rotation of the motor. To achieve

this kind of control, a variable resistor, called a potentiometer, is used. A cir-

cuit containing a potentiometer is shown in
Figure 22-5.Some variable
resistors consist of a coil of resistance wire and a sliding contact point.
Moving the contact point to various positions along the coil varies the

amount of wire in the circuit. As more wire is placed in the circuit, the
resistance of the circuit increases; thus, the current changes in accordance

with the equation IV/R. In this way, the speed of a motor can be adjusted
from fast, with little wire in the circuit, to slow, with a lot of wire in the 

circuit. Other examples of using variable resistors to adjust the levels of 

electrical energy can be found on the front of a TV: the volume, brightness,

contrast, tone, and hue controls are all variable resistors.
The human body
The human body acts as a variable resistor. When dry,
skinÕs resistance is high enough to keep currents that are produced by small
and moderate voltages low. If skin becomes wet, however, its resistance is

lower, and the electric current can rise to dangerous levels. A 
current as low
as 1 mA can be felt as a mild shock, while currents of 15 mA can cause lossof muscle control and currents of 100 mA can cause death.
Diagramming Circuits
A simple circuit can be described in words. It can also be depicted by
photographs or artistsÕ drawings of the parts. Most frequently, however, an

electric circuit is drawn using standard symbols for the circuit elements.

Such a diagram is called a circuit schematic. Some of the symbols used in

circuit schematics are shown in 
Figure 22-6.Figure 22-6
These symbols 
commonly are used to diagram
electric circuits.
ResistanceThe resistance of
an operating 100-W lightbulb isabout 140 
. When the lightbulb
is turned off and at room
temperature, its resistance is only

about 10 . This is because of 
the great difference between room

temperature and the lightbulbÕs

difference across any
component of a circuit. When connecting the voltmeter in a

22.1Section Review
When a voltmeter is connected across another component, it is called a
parallel connectionbecause the circuit component and the voltmeter are
aligned parallel to each other in the circuit, as diagrammed in Figure 22-8a.Any time the current has two or more paths to follow, the connection is
labeled parallel.
The potential difference across the voltmeter is equal to the
potential difference across the circuit element. Always associate the words

voltage across
with a parallel connection.An ammeter measures the current through a circuit component. The samecurrent going through the component must go through the ammeter, so there

can be only one current path. A connection with only one current path,
called a series connection,is shown in 
Figure 22-8b.
To add an ammeter
to a circuit, the wire connected to the circuit component must be removed

and connected to the ammeter instead. Then, another wire is connected
from the second terminal of the ammeter to the circuit component. In a
series connection, there can be only a single path through the connection.
Always associate the words

superconductorkilowatt-hour22.2Using Electric EnergyMany familiar household appliances convert electric energy to some
other form, such as light, kinetic energy, sound, or thermal energy.
When you turn on one of these appliances, you complete a circuit and

begin converting electric energy. In this section, you will learn to determine

the rate of energy conversion and the amount that is converted.
Energy Transfer in Electric Circuits
Energy that is supplied to a circuit can be used in many different w
ays.A motor converts electric energy to mechanical energy, and a lamp changes

electric energy into light. Unfortunately, not all of the energy delivered 

to a motor or a lamp ends up in a useful form. Lightbulbs, especially

incandescent lightbulbs, become hot. Motors are often far too hot to

touch. In each case, some of the electric energy is converted into thermal

energy. You will now examine some devices that are designed to convert as

much energy as possible into thermal energy.
Heating a resistor
Current moving through a resistor causes it to heat up
because flowing electrons bump into the atoms in the resistor. These colli-
sions increase the atomsÕ kinetic energy and, thus, the temperature of the

resistor. A space heater, a hot plate, and the heating element in a hair dryer

all are designed to convert electric energy into thermal energy. These and

other household appliances, such as those pictured in 
Figure 22-9,act likeresistors when they are in a circuit. When charge, 
q, moves through a resis-
tor, its potential difference is reduced by an amount, 
V. As you have
learned, the energy change is represented by 
qV. In practical use, the rate at
which energy is changedÑthe power, 
PE/tÑis more important. Earlier,
you learned that current is the rate at which charge flows, 
Iq/t, and thatpower dissipated in a resistor is represented by 
PIV. For a resistor, 
VIR. Thus, if you know 
Iand R, you can substitute 
VIRinto the equationfor electric power to obtain the following. 
Thus, the power dissipated in a resistor
is proportional both to the square of the
current passing through it and to the
resistance. If you know 
Vand R, but notI, you can substitute 
IV/Rinto PIVto obtain the following equation.
Power
PVR2Power is equal to the voltage squared
divided by the resistance.
Power
PI2RPower is equal to current squared

times resistance.

another. Energy is changed from electric to thermal energy, and the tem-

perature of the resistor rises. If the resistor is an immersion heater or

burner on an electric stovetop, for example, heat flows into cold water fast

enough to bring the water to the boiling point in a few minutes.

A 120-V water heater takes 2.2 h to heat a given volume of water to a certain

temperature. How long would a 240-V unit operating with the same current take to

accomplish the same task? 
Superconductors
A superconductor is a material with zero resistance.
There is no restriction of current in superconductors, so there is no potential
difference, 
V, across them. Because the power that is dissipated in a con-
ductor is given by the product 
IV, a superconductor can conduct electricitywithout loss of energy. At present, almost all superconductors must be kept

at temperatures below 100 K. The practical uses of superconductors

include MRI magnets and in synchrotrons, which use huge amounts of

current and can be kept at temperatures close to 0 K. Transmission of Electric Energy
Hydroelectric facilities, such as the one at Itaipœ
Dam, shown in 
Figure 22-10,
are capable of produc-ing a great deal of energy. This hydroelectric energy

often must be transmitted over long distances to reach

homes and industries. How can the transmission occur

with as little loss to thermal energy as possible?Thermal energy is produced at a rate represented by 
PI2R. Electrical engineers call this unwanted
thermal energy the joule heating loss, or 
I2R loss. To
reduce this loss, either the current, 
I, or the resistance,
R, must be reduced. All wires have some resistance, even though their
resistance is small. The large wire used to carry electric
current into a home has a resistance of 0.20 
for 1 km.Figure 22-10
In the year 2000,energy produced by Itaipœ Dam
met 24 percent of BrazilÕs electric
energy needs and 95 percent of
ParaguayÕs.

Use the figure to the right to help you answer the questions below.
1.Initially, the capacitor is uncharged. Switch 1 is closed, and Switch 2
remains open. What is the voltage across the capacitor?
2.Switch 1 is now opened, and Switch 2 remains open. What is the 

voltage across the capacitor? Why? 
3.Next, Switch 2 is closed, while Switch 1 remains open. What is the 

voltage across the capacitor and the current through the resistor 

immediately after Switch 2 is closed? 
4.As time goes on, what happens to the voltage across the capacitor 

and the current through the resistor? 
Suppose that a farmhouse were connected directly to a power plant 3.5 km
away. 
The resistance in the wires needed to carry a current in a circuit to the home and back to the plant is represented by the following equation:

R2(3.5 km)(0.20 
/km)1.4 . An electric stove might cause a 41-A
current through the wires. The power dissipated in the wires is represented

by the following relationships: 
PI2R(41 A)
2(1.4 )2400 W.
All of this power is converted to thermal energy and, therefore, is
wasted. This loss could be minimized by reducing the resistance. Cables of

high conductivity and large diameter (and therefore low resistance) 

are available, but such cables are expensive and heavy. Because the loss 

of energy is also proportional to the square of the current in the conduc-
tors, it is even more important to keep the current in the transmission 

lines low.
How can the current in the transmission lines be kept low? The electric
energy per second (power) transferred over a long-distance transmission line

is determined by the relationship 
PIV. The current is reduced without thepower being reduced by an increase in the voltage. Some long-distance lines

use voltages of more than 500,000 V. The resulting lower current reduces the

I2Rloss in the lines by keeping the 
I2factor low. Long-distance transmission
lines always 
operate at voltages much higher than household voltages in
order to reduce I2Rloss. The output voltage from the generating plant is
reduced upon arrival at electric substations to 2400 V, and again to 240 V or

120 V before being used in homes.
The Kilowatt-Hour
While electric companies often are called power companies, they actu-
ally provide energy rather than power. Power is the rate at which energy is

delivered. When consumers pay their home electric bills, an example of

which is shown in 
Figure 22-11,
they pay for electric energy, not power.
The amount of electric energy used by a device is its rate of energy 
consumption, in joules per second (W) times the number of seconds that
the device is operated. Joules per second times seconds, (J/s)s, equals the

total amount of joules of energy. The joule, also defined as a watt-second,

is a relatively small amount of energy, too small for commercial sales use. 

For this reason, electric companies measure energy sales in a unit of a 
1200 Switch 2Switch 115 V1.5 FabFigure 22-11

ance in simple circuits. Voltage is the potential difference that pushes current

through a circuit, while resistance determines how much current will flow if a

in order to investigate the mathematical relationships between voltage and current

and between resistance and current.

Can hybrids benefit society?Hybridcars improve gas mileage and reduce tailpipe

emissions. Improved gas mileage saves on the

cost of operating the car. Tailpipe emissions

include carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide,

as well as various hydrocarbons and nitrogen

oxides. These emissions can contribute to cer-

tain problems, such as smog. Because hybrids

improve gas mileage and reduce tailpipe emis-

sions, many people feel that these cars are one

viable way to help protect air quality and 

conserve fuel resources.
Meet the hybrid car.
It is fuel-efficient,comfortable, safe, quiet, clean, and it acceler-

ates well. Hybrid sales are growing and are

expected to exceed 200,000 vehicles in 2005.
Why are they called hybrids?
A vehicle
is called a hybrid if it uses two or more sources

of energy. For example, diesel-electric locomo-

tives are hybrids. But the term 
hybrid vehicleusually refers to a car that uses gas and electricity.
Conventional cars have large engines that
enable them to accelerate quickly and to drive

up steep hills. But the engineÕs size makes it

inefficient. In a hybrid, a lighter, more efficient

gas engine meets most driving needs. When

extra energy is needed, it is supplied by 

electricity from rechargeable batteries.
How do hybrids work?
The illustrationabove shows one type of hybrid, called a paral-

lel hybrid. The small internal combustion

engine (1) powers the car during most driving

situations. The gas engine and electric motor

(2) are connected to the wheels by the same

transmission (3). Computerized electronics 
(4) decide when to use the electric motor,

when to use the engine, and when to use both.
This type of hybrid has no external power
source besides the gas in the fuel tank (5).
Unlike an electric car, you donÕt need to plug

the hybrid into an electric outlet to recharge the

batteries (6). Rather, the batteries are recharged

by a process called regenerative braking, as

shown in the schematic diagram. In conven-

tional vehicles, the brakes apply friction to 

the wheels, converting a vehicleÕs kinetic energy

into heat. However, a hybridÕs electric motor
A hybrid car has agas engine (1) and 
an electric motor (2).In regenerative breaking, energy from the moving car

recharges the batteries.

Key Concepts
¥Conventional current is defined as current in the direction in which a
positive charge would move.
¥Generators convert mechanical energy to electric energy.
¥A circuit converts electric energy to heat, light, or some other useful output.
¥As charge moves through a circuit, resistors cause a drop in potential energy.
¥An ampere is equal to one coulomb per second (1 C/s).¥Power can be found by multiplying voltage times current.
¥The resistance of a device is given by the ratio of the deviceÕs voltage to 

its current.¥OhmÕs law states that the ratio of potential difference to current is a constant

for a given conductor. Any resistance that does not change with temperature,

voltage, or the direction of charge flow obeys OhmÕs law.
¥Circuit current can be controlled by changing voltage, resistance, or both.
RVIPIVKey Concepts
¥The power in a circuit is equal to the square of the current times the

resistance, or to the voltage squared divided by the resistance.
¥If power is dissipated at a uniform rate, the thermal energy converted equals

power multiplied by time. Power also can be represented by 
I2Rand V2/Rtogive the last two equations.
¥Superconductors are materials with zero resistance. At present, the practical

uses of superconductors are limited.¥Unwanted thermal energy produced in the transmission of electric energy 

is called the joule heating loss,or I2R loss. The best way to minimize the
joule heating loss is to keep the current in the transmission wires low.

Transmitting at higher voltages enables current to be reduced without 

power being reduced.

parallel circuit Although the connection may not immediately be clear to you, 
a mountain river can be used to model an electric circuit. From its
source high in the mountains, the river flows downhill to the plains below.
No matter which path the river takes, its change in elevation, from the

mountaintop to the plain, is the same. Some rivers flow downhill in 

a single stream. Other rivers may split into two or more smaller streams 

as they flow over a waterfall or through a series of rapids. In this case, 

part of the river follows one path, while other parts of the river follow 

different paths. No matter how many paths the river takes, however, the

total amount of water flowing down the mountain remains unchanged. 

In other words, the amount of water flowing downhill is not affected by

the path it takes.

What is your
prediction about the brightnesses

No matter whatpath a river or a stream takes

down a mountain, the amount of

water and the drop in elevationare the same.
How does the river shown in 
Figure 23-1model an electric circuit? Thedistance that the river drops is similar to the potential difference in a cir-

cuit. The amount of water flowing in the river is similar to current in a 

circuit. Narrow rapids 
create resistance and are similar to resistors in a cir-cuit. What part of a river is similar to a battery or a generator in an electric 

circuit? The energy source needed to raise water to the top of the mountain
is the Sun. Solar energy evaporates water from lakes and seas leading to the

formation of clouds that release rain or snow that falls on the mountain-

tops. Continue to think about the mountain river model as you read about

the current in electric circuits.
Series Circuits
Three students are connecting two identical lamps to a battery, as illus-
trated in Figure 23-2.Before they make the final connection to the battery,
their teacher asks them to predict the brightnesses of the two lamps. 
Each student knows that the brightness of a lamp depends on the current
through it. The first student predicts that only the lamp close to the posi-
tive (
)terminal of the battery will light because all the current will be
used up as thermal and light energy. The second student predicts that only

part of the current will be used up, and the second lamp will glow, but

more brightly than the first. The third student predicts that the lamps will
be of equal brightness because current is a flow of charge and the charge

leaving the first lamp has nowhere else to go in the circuit except through

the second lamp. The third student reasons that because the current will be
the same in each lamp, the brightness also will be the same. How do you

predict the lights will behave?
If you consider the mountain river model for this circuit, you will 
realize that the third student is correct. Recall from Chapter 20 that charge

cannot be created or destroyed. Because the charge in the circuit has only

one path to follow and cannot be destroyed, the same amount of charge

must leave a circuit as enters the circuit. This means that the current is the

same everywhere in the circuit. If you connect three ammeters in the circuit,

as shown in 
Figure 23-3,they all will show the same current. A circuit
such as this, in which all current travels through each device, is called a

series circuit.If the current is the same throughout the circuit, what is used by the
lamp to produce the thermal and light energy? Recall that power, the rate

at which electric energy is converted, is represented by 
PIV. Thus, if
there is a potential difference, or voltage drop, across the lamp, then electric

energy is being converted into another form. The resistance of the lamp is

defined as RV/I. Thus, the potential difference, also called the voltage
drop, is VIR.Current and resistance in a series circuit
From the river model, you
know that the sum of the drops in height is equal to the total drop from

the top of the mountain to sea level. In an electric circuit, the increase in

voltage provided by the generator or other energy source, 
Vsource, is equalto the sum of voltage drops across lamps A and B, and is represented by

the following equation:

the string of lights is connected to a 120-V outlet, the current through the bulbs is 0.06 A.
a.What is the equivalent resistance of the circuit?
b.What is the resistance of each bulb? 
5.Calculate the voltage drops across the three resistors in problem 2, and verify that their

sum equals the voltage of the battery.
To find the potential drop across 
a resistor,
multiply the current in the circuit by the resistance of the individual resistor. Be
cause the current through the lamps is the same, 
VAIRAand VBIRB.Therefore,
VsourceIRAIRB, or VsourceI(RARB). The current through the circuitis represented by the following equation:
IRVAsourRceBThe same idea can be extended to any number of resistances in series,
not just two. The same current would exist in the circuit with a single resis-
tor, 
R, that has a resistance equal to the sum of the resistances of the two
lamps. Such a resistance is called the 
equivalent resistance
of the circuit.For resistors in series, the equivalent resistance is the sum of all the indi-

vidual resistances, as expressed by the following equation.
Notice that the equivalent resistance is greater than that of any individual
resistor. Therefore, if the battery voltage does not change, adding more

devices in series always decreases the current. To find the current through

a series circuit, first calculate the equivalent resistance and then use the fol-

lowing equation.
CurrentIVsoRurceCurrent in a series circuit is equal to the potential difference of the source
divided by the equivalent resistance.
Equivalent Resistance for Resistors in Series
RRARB. . .The equivalent resistance of resistors in series equals the sum of the

individual resistances of the resistors.
616-626 CH23-S1-845813  3/22/04  5:17 AM  Page 619Voltage drops in a series circuit
As current moves through any circuit,
the net change in potential must be zero. This is because the circuitÕs 
electric energy source, the battery or generator, raises the potential an

amount equal to the potential drop produced when the current passes
through the resistors. Therefore, the net change is zero.
An important application of series resistors is a circuit called a voltage
divider. A 
voltage divider
is a series circuit used to produce a voltage
source of desired magnitude from a higher-voltage battery. For example,

suppose you have a 9-V battery but need a 5-V potential source. Consider

the circuit shown in 
Figure 23-4.Two resistors, 
RAand RB, are connectedin series across a battery of magnitude V. The equivalent resistance of 
the circuit is RRARB. The current is represented by the following
equation:IVRRAVRBThe desired voltage, 5 V, is the voltage drop, 
VB, across resistor RB: VBIRB.Into this equation, theearlier equation for current is substituted.VBIRBRAVRBRBRAVRBRBVoltage dividers often are used with sensors, such as photoresistors. The
resistance of a photoresistor depends upon the amount of light that strikes

cadmium sulfide. A typical photoresistor can have a resistance of 400 
whenlight is striking it compared with a resistance of 400,000 when the pho-toresistor is in the dark. The voltage output of a voltage divider that uses a
photoresistor depends upon the amount of light striking the photoresistor
sensor. This circuit can be used as a light meter, such as the one shown

The parallel paths for current in this diagram are analogous to multiple
paths that a river might take down a mountain.
Parallel Circuits
Look at the circuit shown in 
Figure 23-6.How many current paths 
are there? The current from the generator can go through any of the three
resistors. A circuit in which there are several current paths is called a 

parallel circuit.The three resistors are connected in parallel; both ends ofthe three paths are connected together. In the mountain river model, such

a circuit is illustrated by three paths for the water over a waterfall. Some

paths might have a large flow of water, while others might have a small

flow. The sum of the flows, however, is equal to the total flow of water over

the falls. In addition, regardless of which channel the water flows through,

the drop in height is the same. Similarly, in a parallel electric circuit, the

total current is the sum of the currents through each path, and the poten-
tial difference across each path is the same.

a resistor, and an ammeter 

in a series circuit.

(Hint:Include the idea of resistance.)616-626 CH23-S1-845813  3/22/04  5:20 AM  Page 623What is the current through each resistor in a parallel electric circuit? Itdepends upon the individual resistances. For example, in 
Figure 23-7,thepotential difference across each resistor is 120 V. The current through a
resistor is given by 
IV/R, so you can calculate the current through the
24-resistor as I(120 V)/(24 
) 5.0 A and then calculate the currentsthrough the other two resistors. The total current through the generator is

the sum of the currents through the three paths, in this case, 38 A.
What would happen if the 6-
resistor were removed from the circuit?
Would the current through the 24-
resistor change? That current dependsonly upon the potential difference across it and its resistance; because 
neither has changed, the current also is unchanged. The same is true for the
current through the 9-resistor. The branches of a parallel circuit are inde-
pendent of each other. The total current through the generator, however,

would change. The sum of the currents in the branches would be 18 A if

the 6-resistor were removed.
Resistance in a parallel circuit
How can you find the equivalent resist-
ance of a parallel circuit? In Figure 23-7, the total current through the 
generator is 38 A. Thus, the value of a single resistor that results in a 

38-A current when a 120-V potential difference is placed across it can 

easily be calculated by using the following equation: 
RVI13280AV3.2 Notice that this resistance is smaller than that of any of the three resistors

in parallel. Placing two or more resistors in parallel always decreases the

equivalent resistance of a circuit. The resistance decreases because each

new resistor provides an additional path for current, thereby increasing the

total current while the potential difference remains unchanged.To calculate the equivalent resistance of a parallel circuit, first note that
the total current is the sum of the currents through the branches. If 
IA, IB,and ICare the currents through the branches and Iis the total current, thenIIAIBIC. The potential difference across each resistor is the same,
so the current through each resistor, for example, 
RA, can be found from IAV/RA. Therefore, the equation for the sum of the currents is as follows:
VRRVARVBRVCDividing both sides of the equation by 
Vprovides an equation for the
equivalent resistance of the three parallel resistors.
This equation can be used for any number of resistors in parallel.

Imagine a 60-W and a 100-W bulb are used in a lighting circuit. Recall that
the brightness of a lightbulb is proportional to the power it dissipates, and

that PI2R. When the bulbs are connected in parallel, each is connectedacross 120V and the 100-W bulb glows more brightly. When connected in

series, the current through each bulb is the same. Because the resistance of

the 60-W bulb is greater than that of the 100-W bulb, the higher-resistance

60-W bulb dissipates more power and glows more brightly.

cuits. It is important to understand the requirements and limitations
of these systems. Above all, you need to be aware of the safety measures

that must be followed to prevent accidents and injuries.
Safety Devices
In an electric circuit, fuses and circuit breakers act as safety devices. They
prevent circuit overloads that can occur when too many appliances are

turned on at the same time or when a short circuit occurs in one appliance.

A short circuitoccurs when a circuit with a very low resistance is formed.
The low resistance causes the current to be very large. When appliances are

connected in parallel, each additional appliance placed in operation reduces
the equivalent resistance in the circuit and increases the current through

the wires. This additional current might produce enough thermal energy to

melt the wiringÕs insulation, cause a short circuit, or even begin a fire.
A fuseis a short piece of metal that melts when too large a currentpasses through it. The thickness of the metal used in the fuse is determined
by the amount of current that the circuit is designed to handle safely. If a

large, unsafe current passes through the circuit, the fuse melts and breaks

the circuit. A circuit breaker,
shown in 
Figure 23-9,is an automaticswitch that opens when the current reaches a threshold value. If there is a

current greater than the rated (threshold) value in the circuit, the circuit

becomes overloaded. The circuit breaker opens and stops the current.
Current follows a single path from the power source through an electri-
cal appliance and back to the source. Sometimes, a faulty appliance or an

accidental drop of the appliance into water might create another current

pathway. If this pathway flows through the user, serious injury could result.

A current as small as 5 mA flowing through a person could result in 

electrocution. A ground-fault interrupterin an electric outlet prevents
such injuries because it contains an electronic circuit that detects small 
differences in current caused by an extra current path and opens the circuit.

Electric codes for buildings often require ground-fault interrupters to be
used in bathroom, kitchen, and exterior outlets.

diagrams a parallel circuit used inthe wiring of homes, and also shows some common appliances that would
be connected in parallel. The current in any one circuit does not depend

upon the current in the other circuits. Suppose that a 240-W television is

plugged into a 120-V outlet. The current is represented by 
IP/V. For the
television, I(240 W)/(120 V) 
2.0 A. When a 720-W curling iron is
plugged into the outlet, its current draw is 
I(720 W)/(120 V) 
6.0 A.Finally, a 1440-W hair dryer 
is plugged into the same outlet. The currentthrough the hair dryer is 
I(1440 W)/(120 V) 
12 A. The resistance ofeach appliance can be calculated using the equation RV/I. The equivalent
resistance of the three appliances is as follows.
R160120110161R6 A fuse is connected in series with the power source so that the entire cur-
rent passes through it. The current through the fuse is calculated using the
equivalent resistance.
IVR1620V20 A
If the fuse in the circuit is rated as 15 A, the 20-A current would exceed the

rating and cause the fuse to melt, or Òblow,Ó and cut off current.
Fuses and circuit breakers also protect against the large currents createdby a short circuit. Without a fuse or a circuit breaker, the current caused by

a short circuit easily could start a fire. For example, a short circuit could

occur if the insulation on a lamp cord became old and brittle. The two

wires in the cord might accidentally touch, resulting in a resistance in the
wire of only 0.010 
. This resistance results in a huge current.IVR01.02100V12,000 ASuch a current would cause a fuse or a circuit breaker to open the circuit,

thereby preventing the wires from becoming hot enough to start a fire.

parallel wiringarrangement used in homes allows
the simultaneous use of more

than one appliance. However, if

too many appliances are used

When analyzing a combination series-parallel
circuit, use the following steps to break down 

the problem.
1.Draw a schematic diagram of the circuit.2.Find any parallel resistors. Resistors in
parallel have separate current paths. 
They must have the same potential

differences across them. Calculate the 

single equivalent resistance of a resistor 

that can replace them. Draw a new

schematic using that resistor.
3.Are any resistors (including the equivalent

resistor) now in series? Resistors in series

have one and only one current path through
them. Calculate a single new equivalent
resistance that can replace them. Draw a

new schematic diagram using that resistor.
4.Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you can reduce

the circuit to a single resistor. Find the total

circuit current. Then go backwards through

the circuits to find the currents through and

the voltages across individual resistors.

Have you ever noticed the light in your bathroom or bedroom dim when
you turned on a hair dryer? The light and the hair dryer are connected in
parallel across 120 V. Because of the parallel connection, the current through

the light should not have changed when you turned on the hair dryer. Yet

the light did dim, so the current must have changed. 
The dimming occurredbecause the house wiring had a small resistance. As shown in

An ammeter isconnected in series with two
resistors 
(a).The small resistance
of the ammeter slightly alters the
current in the circuit. A voltmeter is

Ammeters and Voltmeters
An ammeter is a device that is used to measure the current in any branch or part of a circuit. If, for example, you wanted to measure 

the current through a resistor, you would place an ammeter in series 

with the resistor. This would require opening the current path and insert-

ing an ammeter. Ideally, the use of an ammeter should not change the 

current in the circuit. Because the current would decrease if the ammeter

increased the resistance in the circuit, the resistance of an ammeter is
designed to be as low as possible. 
Figure 23-12ashows an ammeter as 
a meter placed in parallel with a 0.01-
resistor. Because the resistance of
the ammeter is much less than that of the resistors, the current decrease 

is negligible.
Another instrument, called a voltmeter,
is used to measure the voltage
drop across a portion of a circuit. To measure the potential drop across a

resistor, a voltmeter is connected in parallel with the resistor. Voltmeters

are designed to have a very high resistance so as to cause the smallest 

possible change in currents and voltages in the circuit. Consider the circuit

shown in 
Figure 23-12b.
A voltmeter is shown as a meter in series with a
10-k
resistor. When the voltmeter is connected in parallel with 
RB, theequivalent resistance of the combination is smaller than 
RBalone. Thus,
the total resistance of the circuit decreases, and the current increases. The

value of 
RAhas not changed, but the current through it has increased,thereby increasing the potential drop across it. The battery, however, holds

the potential drop across RAand RBconstant. Thus, the potential drop
across RBmust decrease. The result of connecting a voltmeter across a resis-
tor is to lower the potential drop across it. The higher the resistance of 

the voltmeter, the smaller the voltage change. Practical meters have resist-

ances of 10 M

Interrupters (GFCI)A ground fault occurs when electricity takes an incorrect path toground, such as through a personÕs body. Charles Dalziel, an engi-

neering professor at the University of California, was an expert on the

effects of electric shock. When he realized that ground faults were the

cause of many electrocutions, he invented a device to prevent such

accidents. How does a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) work?

sensor loopCoil tripsCircuitinterruptedFaultcurrent1In normal operation, 
there are equal and 
opposite currents 
through the wires, 
so the net current 
through the 
transformer is zero. 
2In a ground fault, there  
is current from the hot 
conductor through a 
person and to the 
ground. The currents  
in the two wires are 
unequal, and a net 
current passes through 
the transformer.
3The net current induces a 
changing magnetic field in the 
transformer core, which induces 

a current in the loop with the 
sensor electronics. The sensor 
detects the current and energizes 
an electromagnet, called the trip 
coil, thus breaking the circuit. 
This process takes 0.025 s.A test button on  
the GFCI connects  
a small resistor to  
the circuit, again 
creating unequal 
currents in the 
transformer and 

opening the circuit.4634How It Works

in. How is water a factor in creating

¥The current is the same everywhere in a simple series circuit. 
¥The equivalent resistance of a series circuit is the sum of the resistances of 
its parts. 
¥The current in a series circuit is equal to the potential difference divided 
by the equivalent resistance.
¥The sum of the voltage drops across resistors that are in series is equal to 

the potential difference applied across the combination.¥A voltage divider is a series circuit used to produce a voltage source of 

desired magnitude from a higher-voltage battery. 
¥The voltage drops across all branches of a parallel circuit are the same. 
¥In a parallel circuit, the total current is equal to the sum of the currents in
the branches. 
¥The reciprocal of the equivalent resistance of parallel resistors is equal to 

the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances. 
¥If any branch of a parallel circuit is opened, there is no current in that

branch. The current in the other branches is unchanged. R1R1AR1BR1C. . .IVsoRurceRRARB. . .Key Concepts
¥A fuse or circuit breaker, placed in series with appliances, creates an open

circuit when dangerously high currents flow. 
¥A complex circuit is a combination of series and parallel branches. Any

parallel branch first is reduced to a single equivalent resistance. Then, 

any resistors in series are replaced by a single resistance. 
¥An ammeter is used to measure the current in a branch or part of a circuit.
An ammeter always has a low resistance and is connected in series. 
¥A voltmeter measures the potential difference (voltage) across any part or

combination of parts of a circuit. A voltmeter always has a high resistance

and is connected in parallel with the part of the circuit being measured.635physicspp.com/vocabulary_puzzlemaker

1.Place a bar magnet horizontally in front of 
you so that the north pole faces left.
2.Place a second bar magnet horizontally next

to, and 5.0 cm away from the first (you should
be able to place the compass between the
magnets). The north pole also should be

facing the left.3.Draw your setup on a sheet of paper. Be 

sure to label the poles.
4.Place a compass by the two magnets. 

Draw the direction the arrow is pointing.5.Continue to move the compass to other
positions, each time drawing the direction it
points until you have drawn 15Ð20 arrows.

more than 2000 years. Chinese sailors employed magnets as naviga-
tional compasses approximately 900 years ago. Throughout the world,

early scientists studied magnetic rocks, called lodestones. Today, magnets

play an increasingly important role in our every
day lives. Electric genera-
tors, simple electric motors, television sets
, cathode-ray 
displays, tape
recorders, and computer hard drives all depend on the magnetic effects of

electric currents.
If you have ever used a compass or picked up tacks or paper clips with
a magnet, you have observed some effects of magnetism. You even might

have made an electromagnet by winding wire around a nail and connect-

ing it to a battery. The properties of magnets become most obvious when

you experiment with two of them. To enhance your study of magnetism,

you can experiment with magnets, such as those shown in 
Figure 24-1 onthe next page.

If you suspend amagnet by a thread, it will alignitself with magnetic properties in

Earth 
(a).The magnetÕs north
pole will point north. If you then

move the north pole of a second

magnet toward the north pole 

of the suspended magnet, the
suspended magnet will move
away (b).General Properties of Magnets
Suspend a magnet from a thread, as in Figure 24-2a.If you use a bar
magnet, you might have to tie a yoke around it to keep it horizontal. When

the magnet comes to rest, is it lined up in any particular direction? Now

rotate the magnet so that it points in a different direction. When you

release the magnet, does it come to rest in the same direction? If so, in
which direction does it point? You should have found that the magnet lined up in a north-south direc-
tion. Mark the end that points to the north with the letter Nfor reference.
From this simple experiment, you can conclude that a magnet is 
polarized;that is, it has two distinct and opposite ends. One of the poles is the north-

seeking pole; the other is the south-seeking pole. A compass is nothing

more than a small magnet, mounted so that it is free to turn. Suspend another magnet to determine the north end, and mark it asyou did with the first magnet. While one magnet is suspended, observe 

the interaction of the two magnets by bringing the other magnet near, as in

Figure 24-2b.
What happens as you bring the two ends that were pointing
north, the north poles, toward each other? Now try it with the south poles.

Lastly, what happens as you bring opposite poles (the north pole of one

magnet and the south pole of the other magnet) toward each other?
You should have observed that the two north poles repelled each other,
as did the two south poles. Howe
ver, the north 
pole of one magnet should have attracted the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel;

unlike poles attract. Magnets always have two opposite magnetic poles. 

If you break a magnet in half, you create two smaller magnets, and each

will have two poles. Scientists have tried to break magnets into separate

north and south poles, called monopoles, but no one has succeeded, not

even on the microscopic level.
Knowing that magnets always orient themselves in a north-south direc-
tion, it may occur to you that Earth itself is a giant magnet. Because opposite
poles attract and the north pole of a compass magnet points north, the south
pole of the Earth-magnet must be near EarthÕs geographic north pole.

645Figure 24-3
A common nail is attracted to a magnet. In theprocess, the nail itself becomes

magnetized. Here you can see

when a magnet is touching the
nail, the nail is able to attract
other metal objects. However, 

if you separate the magnet from 
the nail, some of the objects will

drop off because the nail will 
have lost some of its magnetism.
How do magnets affect other materials?
As you probably discovered as
a child, magnets attract things besides other magnets, such as nails, tacks,
paper clips, and many other metal objects. Unlike the interaction between

two magnets, however, either end of a magnet will attract either end of a

piece of metal. How can you explain this behavior? First, you can touch a

magnet to a nail and then touch the nail to smaller metal pieces. The nail

itself becomes a magnet, as shown in 
Figure 24-3.The magnet causes thenail to become polarized. The direction of polarization of the nail depends
on the polarization of the magnet. If you pull away the magnet, the nail

loses some of its magnetization and will no longer exhibit as much attrac-
tion for other metal objects.
If you repeat the experiment shown in Figure 24-3 with a piece of soft
iron (iron with a low carbon content) in place of a nail, you will notice
that the iron loses all of its attraction for the other metal objects when the
magnet is pulled away. This is because soft iron is a temporary magnet. A

nail has other material in it to make it harder and allows it to retain some

of its magnetism when a permanent magnet is pulled away.
Permanent magnets
The magnetism of permanent magnets is producedin the same way in which you created the magnetism of the nail. Because
of the microscopic structure of the magnet material, the induced magnet-
ism becomes permanent. Many permanent magnets are made of an iron

alloy called ALNICO V, that contains a mix of 
aluminum, nickel, andcobalt. A variety of rare earth elements, such as neodymium and gadolin-
ium, produce permanent magnets that are extremely strong for their size.
Magnetic Fields Around Permanent Magnets
When you experimented with two magnets, you noticed that the forces
between magnets, both attraction and repulsion, occur not only when the

magnets touch each other, but also when they are held apart. In the same

way that long-range electric and gravitational forces can be described by

electric and gravitational fields, magnetic forces can be described by the

existence of fieldsaround magnets. These 
magnetic fieldsare vector
quantities that exist in a region in space where a magnetic force occurs.

The magnetic field
of a bar magnet shows up clearlyin three dimensions when the
magnet is suspended in glycerol
with iron filings (a).It is, however,
easier to set up a magnet on a
sheet of paper covered with 
iron filings to see the patternin two dimensions (b).Figure 24-5
Magnetic fieldlines can be visualized as closed

loops leaving the north pole of 

a magnet and entering the south
pole of the same magnet.
The presence of a magnetic field around a magnet can be shown using
iron filings. Each long, thin, iron filing becomes a small magnet by induc-

tion. Just like a tiny compass needle, the iron filing rotates until it 

is parallel to the magnetic field. Figure 24-4ashows filings in a glycerol
solution surrounding a bar magnet. The three-dimensional shape of 
the field is visible. In 
Figure 24-4b,
the filings make up a two-dimensional
plot of the field, which can help you visualize magnetic field lines. Filings

also can show how the field can be distorted by an object.
Magnetic field linesNote that magnetic field lines, like electric field
lines, are imaginary. They are used to help us visualize a field, and they also
provide a measure of the strength of the magnetic field. The number of

magnetic field lines passing through a surface is called the magnetic flux.The flux per unit area is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.
As you can see in Figure 24-4,the magnetic flux is most concentrated at the

poles; thus, this is where the magnetic field strength is the greatest.
The direction of a magnetic field line is defined as the direction inwhich the north pole of a compass points when it is placed in the magnetic
field. Outside the magnet, the field lines emerge from the magnet at 
its north pole and enter the magnet at its south pole, as illustrated in

Figure 24-5.What happens inside the magnet? There are no isolated poles on which field lines can start or stop, so magnetic field lines always

travel inside the magnet from the south pole to the north pole to form

closed loops.

The magnetic field
lines indicated by iron filings on
paper clearly show that like poles

repel (a)and unlike poles attract
(b).The iron filings do not form
continuous lines between like

poles. Between a north and a

south pole, however, the iron

filings show that field lines run
directly between the two magnets. 
Figure 24-7
What kinds of magnetic fields are produced by pairs of bar magnets?
You can visualize these fields by placing two magnets on a sheet of paper,

and then sprinkling the paper with iron filings. 
Figure 24-6ashows the field
lines between two like poles. In contrast, two unlike poles (north and

south) placed close together produce the pattern shown in 
Figure 24-6b.
The filings show that the field lines between two unlike poles run directly

from one magnet to the other.
Forces on objects in magnetic fields
Magnetic fields exert forces onother magnets. The field produced by the north pole of one magnet pushes
the north pole of a second magnet away in the direction of the field 

line. The force exerted by the same field on the south pole of the second

magnet is attractive in a direction opposite the field lines. The second magnet

attempts to line up with the field, just like a compass needle.
When a sample made of iron, cobalt, or nickel is placed in the magneticfield of a permanent magnet, the field lines become concentrated within
the sample. Lines leaving the north pole of the magnet enter one end of

the sample, pass through it, and leave the other end. Thus, the end of the

sample closest to the magnetÕs north pole becomes the sampleÕs south

pole, and the sample is attracted to the magnet.

In 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted was experimenting
with electric currents in wires. Oersted laid a wire across the top of a small

compass and connected the ends of the wire to complete an electrical circuit,as shown in 
Figure 24-8a. He had expected the needle to point toward the
wire or in the same direction as the current in the wire. Instead, he was
amazed to see that the needle rotated until it pointed perpendicular to the
wire, as shown in 
Figure 24-8b.
The forces on the compass magnetÕs poles
were perpendicular to the direction of current in the wire. Oersted also

found that when there was no current in the wire, no magnetic forces

existed.If a compass needle turns when placed near a wire carrying an electriccurrent, it must be the result of a magnetic field created by the current. You

easily can show the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire by 

placing a wire vertically through a horizontal piece of cardboard on which

iron filings are sprinkled. When there is current through the wire, the 

filings will form a pattern of concentric circles, around the wire, as shown

in Figure 24-9.The circular lines indicate that magnetic field lines around current-carry-ing wires form closed loops in the same way that field lines about permanent

magnets form closed loops. The strength of the magnetic field around a long,

straight wire is proportional to the current in the wire. The strength of the

field also varies inversely with the distance from the wire. A compass shows

the direction of the field lines. If you reverse the direction of the current,

the compass needle also reverses its direction, as shown in 
Figure 24-10a.

The magnetic field
around a circular loop of current-carrying wire can be modeled with

the aid of the first right-hand rule
(a).A current in a solenoid creates
a magnetic field with the field
from each coil adding to all theothers (b).Figure 24-12
The second 
right-hand rule can be used 

to determine the polarity of 
an electromagnet.The first right-hand ruleis a method you can use to determine the
direction of a magnetic field relative to the direction of conventional cur-

rent. Imagine holding a length of insulated wire with your right hand.

Keep your thumb pointed in the direction of the conventional (positive)

current. The fingers of your hand circle the wire and point in the direction

of the magnetic field, as illustrated in Figure 24-10b.
Magnetic field near a coilAn electric current in a single circular loop ofwire forms a magnetic field all around the loop. Applying the right-hand
rule to any part of the wire loop, it can be shown that the direction of the

field inside the loop is always the same. In 
Figure 24-11a,
the field is always
up, or out of the page. Outside the loop, it is always down, or into the page.

When a wire is looped several times to form a coil and a current is allowed

to flow through the coil, the field around 
all the loops is in the same direc-tion, as shown in 
Figure 24-11b.
A long coil of wire consisting of many
loops is called a solenoid.The field from each loop in a solenoid adds tothe fields of the other loops and creates a greater total field strength. When there is an electric current in a coil of wire, the coil has a field simi-
lar to a permanent magnet. When this current-carrying coil is brought close
to a suspended bar magnet, one end of the coil repels the north pole of the
magnet. Thus, the current-carrying coil has a north and a south pole and is

itself a magnet. This type of magnet, which is created when current flows

through a wire coil, is called an electromagnet.The strength of the field isproportional to the current in the coil. The magnetic field produced by each

loop is the same. 
Because these fields are in the same direction, increasingthe number of loops increases the strength of the magnetic field.The strength of an electromagnet also can be increased by placing an iron
rod or core inside the coil. The core supports the magnetic field better than
air does. It increases the magnetic field because the field of the solenoid

creates a temporary magnetic field in the core, just as a nearby permanent

magnet does when brought near a metal object.The second right-hand ruleis a method you can use to determine the
direction of the field produced by an electromag
net relative to the flow of
conventional current. Imagine 
holding an insulated coil with your right
hand. If you then curl your fingers around the loops in the direction of the

conventional (positive) current, as in 
Figure 24-12,your thumb will point
toward the north pole of the electromagnet.

Recall that when you put a piece of iron, nickel, or cobalt next to a 
magnet, the element also becomes magnetic, and it develops north and
south poles. The magnetism, however, is only temporary. The creation of

this temporary polarity depends on the direction of the external field.
When you take away the external field, the element loses its magnetism.

The three elementsÑiron, nickel, and cobaltÑbehave like electromagnets in

many ways. 
They have a property called ferromagnetism.
In the early nineteenth century, French scientist Andr”-Marie Amp‘re
knew that the magnetic effects of an electromagnet are the result of electric
current through its loops. He proposed a theory of magnetism in iron to

explain this behavior. Amp‘re reasoned that the effects of a bar magnet

must result from tiny loops of current within the bar.
Magnetic domainsAlthough the details of Amp‘reÕs reasoning were
wrong, his basic idea was correct. Each electron in an atom acts like a tiny
electromagnet. When the magnetic fields of the electrons in a group of
neighboring atoms are all aligned in the same direction, the group is called
a domain.Although they may contain 10
20individual atoms, domains are
still very smallÑusually from 10 to 1000 microns. Thus, even a small sam-

ple of iron contains a huge number of domains.
When a piece of iron is not in a magnetic field, the domains point inrandom directions, and their magnetic fields cancel one another out. If,

however, a piece of iron is placed in a magnetic field, the domains tend to

align with the external field, as shown in 
Figure 24-14.In the case of atemporary magnet, after the external field is removed, the domains return

to their random arrangement. In a permanent magnet, the iron has been
alloyed with other substances to keep the domains aligned after the exter-

nal magnetic field is removed.

Electromagnets make up the recording heads of audio-cassette and videotape recorders. Recorders create electrical signals that
represent the sounds or pictures being recorded. The electric signals pro-
duce currents in the recording head that create magnetic fields. When

magnetic recording tape, which has many tiny bits of magnetic material

bonded to thin plastic, passes over the recording head, the domains of the

bits are aligned by the magnetic fields of the head. The directions of the

domainsÕ alignments depend on the direction of the current in the head
and become a magnetic record of the sounds or pictures being recorded.
The magnetic material on the tape allows the domains to keep their align-

ments until a strong enough magnetic field is applied to change them
again. On a playback of the tape, the signal, produced by currents gener-

ated as the head passes over the magnetic particles, goes to an amplifier

and a pair of loudspeakers or earphones. When a previously recorded tape

is used to record new sounds, an erase head produces a rapidly alternating

magnetic field that randomizes the directions of the domains on the tape.
A magnetic history of the EarthRocks containing iron have recorded the
history of the varying directions of EarthÕs magnetic field. Rocks on the
seafloor were produced when molten rock poured out of cracks in the bot-

tom of the oceans. As they cooled, the rocks were magnetized in the direc-

tion of EarthÕs field at the time. As a result of seafloor spreading, the rocks

farther from the cracks are older than those near the cracks. Scientists who

first examined seafloor rocks were surprised to find that the direction of

the magnetization in different rocks varied. They concluded from their

data that the north and south magnetic poles of Earth have exchanged

places many times in EarthÕs history. The origin of EarthÕs magnetic field is

not well understood. How this field might reverse direction is even more

of a mystery.

armatureAs you learned in the previous section, while Amp‘re was studying

the behaviors of magnets, he noted that an electric current produces
a magnetic field similar to that of a permanent magnet. Because a magneticfield exerts forces on permanent magnets, Amp‘re hypothesized that there is
also a force on a current-carrying wire when it is placed in a magnetic field.Forces on Currents in Magnetic Fields
The force on a wire in a magnetic field can be demonstrated using thearrangement shown in 
Figure 24-15.A battery produces current in a wiredirectly between two bar magnets. Recall that the direction of the magnetic

field between two magnets is from the north pole of one magnet to the

south pole of the other magnet. When there is a current in the wire, a force

is exerted on the wire. Depending on the direction of the current, the force

on the wire either pushes it down, as shown in 
Figure 24-15a,or pulls itup, as shown in 
Figure 24-15b.
Michael Faraday discovered that the force
on the wire is at right angles to both the direction of the magnetic field and
the direction of the current.Determining the forceÕs direction
FaradayÕs description of the force on a
current-carrying wire does not completely describe the direction becausethe force can be upward or downward. The direction of the force on a cur-

rent-carrying wire in a magnetic field can be found by using 
the thirdright-hand rule.
This technique is illustrated in Figure 24-16.The mag-netic field is represented by the symbol 
B, and its direction is representedby a series of arrows. To use the third right-hand rule, point the fingers of

your right hand in the direction of the magnetic field, and point your

thumb in the direction of the conventional (positive) current in the wire.

The palm of your hand will be facing in the direction of the force acting on

the wire. When drawing a directional arrow that is into or out of the page,

direction is indicated with crosses and dots, respectively. Think of the

crosses as the tail feathers of the arrow, and the dots as the arrowhead. 
Soon after Oersted announced his discovery that the direction of the
magnetic field in a wire is perpendicular to the flow of electric current in

the wire, Amp‘re was able to demonstrate the forces that current-carrying

wires exert on each other. 
Figure 24-17ashows the direction of the mag-
netic field around each of the current-carrying wires, 
which is determinedby the first right-hand rule. By applying the third right-hand rule to either

wire, you can show why the wires attract each other. 
Figure 24-17bdemon-strates the opposite situation.
When currents are in opposite
directions, the wires have a

repulsive force  between them.

direction (a),and are repelledwhen the currents are in opposite

It is possible to deter-mine the force of magnetism exerted on a current-carrying wire passing
through a magnetic field at right angles to the wire. Experiments show that

the magnitude of the force, 
F, on the wire, is proportional to the strength
of the field, B,the current, I,in the wire, and the length, 
L,of the wire inthe magnetic field. The relationship of these four factors is as follows:
The strength of a magnetic field, B,is measured in teslas, T. 1 T is equivalent
to 1 N/Am.Note that if the wire is not perpendicular to the magnetic field, a factor ofsin is introduced in the above equation, resulting in 
FILBsin . As thewire becomes parallel to the magnetic field, the angle becomes zero, andthe force is reduced to zero. When 90¡, the equation is again 
FILB.
Loudspeakers
One use of the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field is ina loudspeaker. A loudspeaker changes electric energy to sound energy
using a coil of fine wire mounted on a paper cone and placed in a mag-
netic field. The amplifier driving the loudspeaker sends a current through
the coil. The current changes direction between 20 and 20,000 times each

second, depending on the pitch of the tone it represents. A force exerted on

the coil, because it is in a magnetic field, pushes the coil either into or out
of the field, depending on the direction of the current. The motion of the
coil causes the cone to vibrate, thereby creating sound waves in the air.
Force on a Current-Carrying Wire in a Magnetic Field
FILBThe force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field is equal to the
product of magnetic field strength, the current, and the length of the wire.652-659 CH24-S2-845813  7/22/04  3:46 PM  Page 653654Chapter 24Magnetic Fields

If a wire loop isplaced in a magnetic field whenthere is a current, the loop 
will rotate 
(a).The coil in 
a galvanometer rotates in 

proportion to the magnitude 
of the current (b).Galvanometers
The forces exerted on a loop of wire in a magnetic field can be used tomeasure current. If a small loop of current-carrying wire is placed in the
strong magnetic field of a permanent magnet, as in Figure 24-18a,it ispossible to measure very small currents. The current passing through the

loop goes in one end of the loop and out the other end. Applying the third
right-hand rule to each side of the loop, note that one side of the loop is
forced down, while the other side of the loop is forced up. The resulting

torque rotates the loop, and the magnitude of the torque acting on the
loop is proportional to the magnitude of the current. This principle is used
in a galvanometer. A 
galvanometer
is a device used to measure very small
currents, and therefore, it can be used as a voltmeter or an ammeter.
A small spring in the galvanometer exerts a torque that opposes the
torque that results from the flow of current through the wire loop; thus,

the amount of rotation is proportional to the current. The meter is cali-
brated by finding out how much the coil turns when a known current is

sent through it, as shown in 
Figure 24-18b.
The galvanometer can then be
used to measure unknown currents.
Many galvanometers produce full-scale deflections with as little as 
50 
A (50
106A) of current. The resistance of the coil of wire in a sensitive
galvanometer is about 1000 
. To measure larger currents, a galvanometer
can be converted into an ammeter by placing a resistor with resistance

smaller than the galvanometer in parallel with the meter, as shown in 
Figure24-19a.Most of the current, Is, passes through the resistor, called the shunt,
because the current is inversely 
proportional to resistance; whereas only afew microamps, 
Im, flow through the galvanometer. The resistance of the
shunt is chosen according to the desired deflection scale.
A galvanometer also can be connected as a voltmeter. To make a volt-
meter, a resistor, called the multiplier, is placed in series with the meter, as
shown in 
Figure 24-19b.
The galvanometer measures the current through
the multiplier. The current is represented by 
IV/R, where Vis the voltage
across the voltmeter and 
Ris the effective resistance of the galvanometer
and the multiplier resistor. Now suppose you want the needle of a volt-

meter to move across the entire scale when 10 V is placed across it. The

resistor is chosen so that at 10 V, the meter is deflected full-scale by the 

current through the meter and the resistor.

vanometer cannot rotate more than 180
°. The forces push the right side ofthe loop up and the left side of the loop down until the loop reaches the
vertical position. The loop will not continue to turn because the forces 

are still up and down, now parallel to the loop, and can cause no further

rotation.How can you allow the loop to continue to rotate? The current 
through the loop must reverse direction just as the loop reaches its vertical

position. This reversal allows the loop to continue rotating, as illustrated

in Figure 24-20.
To reverse current direction, an electric connection is
made between contacts, called brushes, and a ring that is split into two

halves, called a split-ring commutator. Brushes, which are usually pieces of

graphite, make contact with the commutator and allow current to flow

into the loop. As the loop rotates, so does the commutator. The split 

ring is arranged so that each half of the commutator changes brushes 
just as the loop reaches the vertical position. Changing brushes reverse the

current in the loop. As a result, the direction of the force on each side of
the loop is reversed, and the loop continues to rotate. This process repeats

at each half-turn, causing the loop to spin in the magnetic field. The result
is an electric motor,
which is an apparatus that converts electric energy
into rotational kinetic energy.
Although only one loop is indicated in Figure 24-20, in an electric
motor, the wire coil, called the 
armature,
is made of many loops mounted
on a shaft or axle. The total force acting on the armature is proportional to

nILB,where nis the total number of turns on the armature, 
Bis thestrength of the magnetic field, Iis the current, and Lis the length of wirein each turn that moves through the magnetic field. The magnetic field is

produced either by permanent magnets or by an electromagnet, called a

field coil. The torque on the armature, and, as a result, the speed of the

motor, is controlled by varying the current through the motor.
656Chapter 24Magnetic Fields
CommutatorBrushNSThe figure shows two identical motors with a common shaft. For
simplicity, the commutators are not shown. Each armature coil

consists of 48 turns of wire with rectangular dimensions of 17 cm

wide by 35 cm deep. The armature resistance is 12 
. The red
wire travels to the left (along half the width) and then back 
to the rear of the motor (along the depth). The magnetic field 

is 0.21 T. The diameter of the pulley is 7.2 cm. A rope fixed to 

the pulley and the floor prevents the motor shaft from turning.

and horizontally to form pictures

Charged particles do not have to be confined to a wire. They also can
move in a vacuum where the air particles have been removed to prevent

collisions. A picture tube, also called a cathode-ray tube, in a 

computer monitor or television set uses electrons deflected by magnetic

fields to form the pictures on the screen, as illustrated in Figure 24-21.
Electric fields pull electrons off atoms in the negative electrode, or cathode.

Other electric fields gather, accelerate, and focus the electrons into a nar-

row beam. Magnetic fields control the motion of the beam back-and-forth

and up-and-down across the screen. The screen is coated with a phosphor

that glows when it is struck by the electrons, thereby producing the picture.
The force produced by a magnetic field on a single electron depends on
the velocity of the electron, the strength of the field, and the angle between

directions of the velocity and the field. Consider a single electron moving

in a wire of length L.The electron is moving perpendicular to the magnetic
field. The current, I,is equal to the charge per unit time entering the wire,
Iq/t. In this case, 
qis the charge of the electron and tis the time it takesto move the distance, 
L.The time required for a particle with speed vtotravel distance 
Lis found by using the equation of motion, 
dvt,or, 
in this case, 
tL/v.
As a result, the equation for the current, Iq/t,can be replaced by 
Iqv/L.Therefore, the force on a single electron moving
perpendicular to a magnetic field of strength Bcan be found.The particleÕs charge is measured in coulombs, C, its velocity in meters per

second, m/s, and the strength of the magnetic field in teslas, T.
The direction of the force is perpendicular to both the velocity of the
particle and the magnetic field. The direction given by the third right-hand

rule is for positively charged particles. For electrons, the force is in the

opposite direction. Force of a Magnetic Field on

The force on a particle moving in a magnetic field is equal to the product of

Data and software commands for computers are processed digitally in
bits. Each bit is identified as either a 0 or a 1. How are these bits stored?
The surface of a computer storage disk is covered with an even distribution

of magnetic particles within a film. The direction of the particlesÕ domains
changes in response to a magnetic field. During recording onto the disk,
current is routed to the disk driveÕs read/write head, which is an electro-

magnet composed of a wire-wrapped iron core. The current through the

wire induces a magnetic field in the core.
When the read/write head passes over the spinning storage disk, as in
Figure 24-22,the domains of atoms in the magnetic film line up in bands.
The orientation of the domains depends on the direction of the current. Two bands code for one bit of information. Two bands magnetized with
the poles oriented in the same direction represent 0. Two bands represent

1 with poles oriented in opposite directions. The recording current always

reverses when the read/write head begins recording the next data bit.
To retrieve data, no current is sent to the read/write head. Rather, the
magnetized bands in the disk induce current in the coil as the disk spins
beneath the head. Changes in the direction of the induced current are
sensed by the computer and interpreted as 0Õs and 1Õs.

Something as simple asmagnetic fieldsdeflecting charged particles has led to a revolu-
tion in how we 
measure or detect the movement
of things, such as bicycle wheels and automo-

tive crankshafts. It 
all starts when current passesthrough a wide, flat 
conductor, in the presence
of a magnetic field.A Useful SensorEngineers have developed
the Hall-effect sensor. These tiny black plastic

devices contain a thin film of silicon with wires
connected, as shown in the diagram. The Hall

voltage wires are connected to a tiny amplifier

so that other instruments can detect it.If a permanent magnet is moved near a
Hall-effect sensor, the voltage from the ampli-

fier will increase. Thus, the sensor can be used

to detect the proximity of the magnet.The magnetic lines of force are perpendicularto the ribbonÕs broad surface. This makes the

flowing electrons crowd into one side of the

ribbon. Because there are more electrons on one
edge of the ribbon than on the other, a voltage,

called the Hall voltage,
is generated across thewidth of the ribbon. The magnitude of the
Hall voltage is dependent upon the strength 

of the magnetic field.E.H. Hall discovered this effect in 1879. Its
industrial and scientific significance were dis-

covered only recently because the Hall voltage

is small in ribbons of conventional metals.

Now, very thin layers of semiconducting silicon

yield substantial Hall voltages.
The Hall effect can be used to explore conduc-
tion in different types of materials. The sign of

the Hall-effect voltage gives the sign of the mov-

ing charge, and the magnitude of the voltage tells

us about the density and velocity of the charge.

Such experiments have shown that in copper and

most other metals, electrons carry the charge,
but in zinc it is the positive charges that move.
Everyday Applications
Bicycle speedome-
ters use a permanent magnet attached to the
front wheel. Each revolution of the wheel brings

the magnet close to a Hall-effect sensor. The

resulting pulses are counted and timed. Hall-
effect sensors also are used to time the spark in
automobile engines. When a magnet mounted

on the crankshaft or distributor rotor moves

near a sensor, a voltage pulse is produced, and

the ignition system instantly fires the spark plug.
A magnetic field forces more electrons to the edge of a
thin metal strip. This creates the Hall voltage.
Bicycle speedometers use a Hall-effect sensor to

display the speed at which a bicycle is moving.

Key Concepts
¥Like magnetic poles repel; unlike magnetic poles attract.¥Magnetic fields exit from the north pole of a magnet and enter its south pole.
¥Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.
¥A magnetic field exists around any carrying-current wire.
¥A coil of wire carrying a current has a magnetic field. The field about the coilis like the field about a permanent magnet.Key Concepts
¥The strength of a magnetic field is measured in teslas. 
¥When a current-carrying wire is placed in a magnetic field, there exists a
force on the wire, perpendicular to both the field and the wire. 
¥The force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field is proportional to
the field strength, the current flow, and the length of the wire. 
¥A galvanometer consists of a loop of wire in a magnetic field, and is used to

measure small currents. When current is passed through the loop, a force 

on the wire loop results in a deflection of the loop.  ¥A galvanometer can be used as an ammeter by adding a shunt resistor in

parallel with the galvanometer.
¥A galvanometer can be used as a voltmeter by adding a multiplier resistor in

series with the galvanometer.
¥A loudspeaker functions by varying the current through a coil that is placed 

in a magnetic field. The coil is attached to a paper cone that moves when 

the coil moves. As the current varies, the cone vibrates, thereby producing

sound.¥An electric motor consists of a coil of wire placed in a magnetic field. When
there is a current in the coil, the coil rotates as a result of the force on the
wire in the magnetic field. Complete 360°rotation is achieved by using 
a commutator to switch the direction of the current in the coil as the 
coil rotates.
¥The force that a magnetic field exerts on a charged particle depends on 
three factors: the velocity of the particle, the charge of the particle, and the

strength of the field. The direction of the force is perpendicular to both 
the field and the particleÕs velocity.
¥Computer monitors and television screens function by using magnets to

focus and direct particles on phosphor screens. When particles strike the

screen, light is emitted, and produces images on the screen.FqvBFILB663physicspp.com/vocabulary_puzzlemaker

average powerIn Chapter 24, you learned how Hans Christian Oersted discovered that

an electric current produces a magnetic field. Michael Faraday thought
that the reverse must also be true: that a magnetic field produces an elec-

tric current. In 1822, Michael Faraday wrote a goal in his notebook:

ÒConvert magnetism into electricity.Ó Faraday tried many combinations of

magnetic fields and wires without success. After nearly ten years of unsuc-

cessful experiments, Faraday found that he could induce electric current by

moving a wire through a magnetic field. In the same year, Joseph Henry,

an American high-school teacher, also showed that a changing magnetic

field could produce electric current. Henry took an idea developed by

another scientist and broadened the application to other educational
demonstration devices to make them more sensitive or powerful. HenryÕs

versions of these devices were not new discoveries, but he made the devices

more dramatic and effective as educational aids. However, Henry, unlike

Faraday, chose not to publish his discoveries.

rent, but when the wire moves up through the field, the current is in one

direction. When the wire moves down through the field, the current is in

the opposite direction. An electric current is generated in a wire only when
the wire cuts magnetic field lines.
Faraday found that to generate current, either the conductor can move
through a magnetic field or a magnetic field can move past the conductor.

It is the relative motion between the wire and the magnetic field that pro-

duces the current. The process of generating a current through a circuit in
this way is called 
electromagnetic induction.How can you tell the direction of the current? To find the force on the
charges in the wire, use the 
fourth right-hand rule to hold your right
hand so that your thumb points in the direction in which the wire is moving

and your fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field. The palm of

your hand will point in the direction of the conventional (positive) current,

as illustrated in Figure 25-2.670-678 CH25-S1-845813  3/30/04  9:18 PM  Page 672Electromotive Force
When you studied electric circuits, you learned that a source of electrical
energy, such as a battery, is needed to produce a continuous current. The
potential difference, or voltage, given to the charges by a battery is called the

electromotive force,
or EMF. Electromotive force, however, is not actually
a force; instead, it is a potential difference and is measured in volts. Thus, the

term electromotive force is misleading. Like many other historical terms still

in use, it originated before the related principlesÑin this case, those of elec-

tricityÑwere well understood. The 
EMFis the influence that makes currentflow from lower to higher potential, like a water pump in a water fountain.
What created the potential difference that caused an induced current inFaradayÕs experiment? When you move a wire through a magnetic field,

you exert a force on the charges and they move in the direction of the force.

Work is done on the charges. Their electrical potential energy, and thus

their potential, is increased. The difference in potential is called the
induced EMF. EMFdepends on the magnetic field, B, the length of the wirein the magnetic field, L, and the velocity of the wire in the field that is per-
pendicular to the field, v(sin ). If a wire moves through a magnetic field at an angle to the field, only the
component of the wireÕs velocity that is perpendicular to the direction of 

the magnetic field generates EMF. If the wire moves through the field with 
a velocity that is exactly perpendicular to the field, then the above equation

reduces to EMFBLv, because sin 90
°1. Checking the units of the EMFequation will help you work algebra correctly in related problems. 
The unit for measuring EMFis the volt, V. In Chapter 24, 
Bwas defined as
F/IL;therefore, the units for 
Bare N/Am. Velocity is measured in m/s.

A microphone is asimple application that depends on an induced
EMF. A dynamic microphone is similar in construc-tion to a loudspeaker. The microphone shown in

Figure 25-3has a diaphragm attached to a coil ofwire that is free to move in a magnetic field. Sound

waves vibrate the diaphragm, which moves the coil

in the magnetic field. The motion of the coil, in
turn, induces an EMFacross the ends of the coil.The induced EMFvaries as the frequency of the
sound varies. In this way, the sound wave is con-

verted to an electrical signal. The voltage generated

is small, typically 10
3V, but it can be increased, or
amplified, by electronic devices.
Electromotive Force
EMFBLv(sin )Electromotive force is equal to the magnitude of the magnetic field, times the
length of the wire times the component of the velocity of the wire in the field

perpendicular to the field.Section 25.1Electric Current from Changing Magnetic Fields

Electric Generators
The electric generator,
invented by Michael Faraday, converts mechan-
ical energy to electrical energy. An electric generator consists of a number

of wire loops placed in a strong magnetic field. The wire is wound around

an iron core to increase the strength of the magnetic field. The iron and
wires are called the armature, which is similar to that of an electric motor.
The armature is mounted so that it can rotate freely in the magneticfield. As the armature turns, the wire loops cut through the magnetic field

lines and induce an EMF. Commonly called the voltage, the 
EMFdevel-
oped by the generator depends on the length of wire rotating in the field.

Increasing the number of loops in the armature increases the wire length,
thereby increasing the induced 
EMF. Note that you could have a length of
wire with only part of it in the magnetic field. Only the portion within the
magnetic field induces an EMF.Current from a generator
When a generator is connected in a closed circuit, the induced EMFproduces an electric current. Figure 25-4shows
a single-loop generator without an iron core. The direction of the induced

current can be found from the third right-hand rule. As the loop rotates,

the strength and the direction of the current change.

shown in 
Figure 25-5a.In this position, the component of the loopÕs
velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field is greatest. As the loop rotates

from the horizontal to the vertical position, as shown in 
Figure 25-5b,
itmoves through the magnetic field lines at an ever-increasing angle. Thus, 

it cuts through fewer magnetic field lines per unit of time, and the current

decreases. When the loop is in the vertical position, the wire segments

move parallel to the field and the current is zero. As the loop continues to

turn, the segment that was moving up begins to move down and reverses

the direction of the current in the loop. This change in direction takes
place each time the loop turns through 180°. The current changessmoothly from zero to some maximum value and back to zero during each

half-turn of the loop. Then it reverses direction. A graph of current versus

time is shown in 
Figure 25-5c.Does the entire loop contribute to the induced EMF? Look at Figure 25-6,where all four sides of the loop are depicted in the magnetic field. Ifthe fourth right-hand rule is applied to segment ab, the direction of theinduced current is toward the side of the wire. The same applies to segment

cd. Thus, no current is induced along the length of the wire in 
abor cd. Butin segment bc, the direction of the induced current is from b to c, and insegment ad, the current is from dto a.Because the conducting loop is rotating in a circular motion, the relative
angle between a point on the loop and the magnetic field constantly

changes. The electromotive force can be calculated by the electromotive

force equation given earlier, 
EMFBLv(sin ), except that Lis now the
length of segment bc. The maximum voltage is induced when a conductor
is moving perpendicular to the magnetic field and thus 
90°. Generators, such as those in the chap-
ter opening image, work in a similar 

fashion. Potential energy from water

stored behind a dam is converted to

kinetic energy, which spins the turbines.

ductors in a magnetic field, thereby

Alternating-Current Generators
An energy source turns the armature of a generator in a magnetic fieldat a fixed number of revolutions per second. In the United States, electric

utilities use a 60-Hz frequency, in which the current goes from one direc-

tion to the other and back to the first 60 times per second. Figure 25-7ashows how an alternating current, AC, in an armature is transmitted to the

rest of the circuit. The brush-slip-ring arrangement permits the armature to
turn freely while still allowing the current to pass into the external circuit.

As the armature turns, the alternating current varies between some maxi-

mum value and zero, as shown in the graph in 
Figure 25-7b.
Average power
The power produced by a generator is the product of the
current and the voltage. Because both current and voltage vary, the power

associated with an alternating current varies. 
Figure 25-7cshows a graph
of the power produced by an AC generator. Note that power is always pos-

itive because

referring to their maximum values.

In this section you have explored how moving wires in magnetic fields
can induce current. However, as Faraday discovered, changing magnetic
fields around a conductor also can induce current in the conductor. In the

next section, you will explore changing magnetic fields and the applica-

tions of induction by changing magnetic fields.
Similarly, the following equation can be used to express effective voltage.
Effective voltage, also is commonly referred to as RMS (root mean square)
voltage. In the United States, the voltage generally available at wall outlets

is described as 120 V, where 120 V is the magnitude of the effective volt-

age, not the maximum voltage. The frequency and effective voltage that are

used vary in different countries.

magnetic field. The act of generating current produces a force on the wiresin the armature. In what direction is the force on the wires of an armature?
Lenz’s Law
Consider a section of one loop that moves through a magnetic field, as
shown in 
Figure 25-8a.An EMF, equal to BLv, will be induced in the wire.
If the magnetic field is out of the page and velocity is to 
the right, then the
fourth right-hand rule shows a downward 
EMF, as illustrated in Figure 25-8b,
and consequently a downward current is produced. In Chapter 24, you
learned that a wire carrying a current through a magnetic field will experi-ence a force acting on it. This force results from the interaction between the

existing magnetic field and the magnetic field generated around all cur-
rents. To determine the direction of this force, use the third right-hand

rule: if current, I, is down and the magnetic field, 
B, is out, then the result-ing force is to the left, as shown in 
Figure 25-8c.This means that the direc-tion of the force on the wire opposes the original motion of the wire, 
v.That is, the force acts to slow down the rotation of the armature. The

method of determining the direction of a force was first demonstrated in

1834 by H.F.E. Lenz and is therefore called LenzÕs law.
LenzÕs law
states that the direction of the induced current is such that themagnetic field resulting from the induced current opposes the change in the
field that caused the induced current. Note that it is the change in the field
and not the field itself that is opposed by the induced magnetic effects.
Opposing changeFigure 25-9, on the next page, is an example of how
LenzÕs law works. The north pole of a magnet is moved toward the left end
of a coil of wire. To create a force that will oppose the approach of the

north pole, the left end of the coil also must become a north pole. In other

words, the magnetic field lines must emerge from the left end of the coil.

Using the second right-hand rule, which you learned in Chapter 24, you

will see that if LenzÕs law is correct, the induced current must be in a coun-

terclockwise direction as viewed from the end of the coil where the mag-

net is inserted. Experiments have shown that this is so. If the magnet is

turned so that a south pole approaches the coil, the induced current will
flow in a clockwise direction.

F. Notice that the resulting force

v, of the wire.679-685 CH25-S2-845813  3/30/04  9:42 PM  Page 679680Chapter 25Electromagnetic Induction
Induced currentSNSNEddycurrentaFigure 25-10
Sensitive balances
use eddy-current damping tocontrol oscillations of the balance
beam (a).As the metal plate 
on the end of the beam moves

through the magnetic field, a
current is generated in the metal.

This current, in turn, produces 

a magnetic field that opposes 

the motion that caused it, and 

the motion of the beam is
dampened (b).If a generator produces only a small current, then the opposing force onthe armature will be small, and the armature will be easy to turn. If the

generator produces a larger current, the force on the larger current will 
be greater, and the armature will be more difficult to turn. A generator

supplying a large current is producing a large amount of electric energy.

The opposing force on the armature means that mechanical energy must
be supplied to the generator to produce the electric energy, consistent with

the law of conservation of energy.
Motors and LenzÕs lawLenzÕs law also applies to motors. When a 
current-carrying wire moves in a magnetic field, an 
EMFis generated. ThisEMF, called the back-EMF, is in a direction that opposes the current. Whena motor is first turned on, there is a large current because of the low resist-
ance of the motor. As the motor begins to turn, the motion of the wires

across the magnetic field induces a back-EMFthat opposes the current.Therefore, the net current through the motor is reduced. If a mechanical

load is placed on the motor, as in a situation in which work is being done

to lift a weight, the rotation of the motor will slow. This slowing down will

decrease the back-EMF, which will allow more current through the motor.
Note that this is consistent with the law of conservation of energy: if current

increases, so does the rate at which electric power is being sent to the motor.

This power is delivered in mechanical form to the load. If the mechanical

load stops the motor, current can be so high that wires overheat.
As current draw varies with the changing speed of an electric motor, the
voltage drop across the resistance of the wires supplying the motor also

varies. Another device, such as a lightbulb, that is in parallel with the

motor, also would experience the drop in voltage. This is why you may

have noticed some lights in a house dimming when a large motorized

appliance, such as an air conditioner or a table saw, starts operating.
When the current to the motor is interruptedby a switch in the circuit being turned off or by

the motorÕs plug being pulled from a wall outlet,

the sudden change in the magnetic field gener-
ates a back-EMF. This reverse voltage can be large
enough to cause a spark across the switch or
between the plug and the wall outlet.
Application of LenzÕs lawA sensitive balance,
such as the kind used in laboratories, uses LenzÕs
law to stop its oscillation when an object is

placed on the pan. As shown in 
Figure 25-10,
apiece of metal attached to the balance arm is
located between the poles of a horseshoe mag
net.Figure 25-9

EMF681IIEMFinducedIWhen the balance arm swings, the metal moves through the magnetic
field. Currents called eddy currentsare generated in the metal and pro-duce a magnetic field that acts to oppose the motion that caused the cur-
rents. Thus, the metal piece is slowed down. The force opposes the motion

of the metal in either direction but does not act if the metal is still. Thus,

the force does not change the mass read by the balance. This effect is called

eddy-current damping. A practical motor or transformer core is con-
structed from thin laminations, or layers, each one insulated from the

other, to reduce the circulation of eddy currents.
Eddy currents are generated when a piece of metal moves through a mag-
netic field. The reverse is also true: a current is generated when a metal loop

is placed in a changing magnetic field. According to LenzÕs law, the current

generated will oppose the changing magnetic field. The current generates amagnetic field of its own in the opposite direction that causes the uncut,

aluminum ring in Figure 25-11
to float. An AC current is in the coil, so a
constantly changing magnetic field is generated. This changing magnetic
field induces an EMFin the rings. If these rings were constructed from a
nonconducting material such as nylon or brass, an 
EMFcould not beinduced. For the uncut ring, the 
EMFcauses a current that produces amagnetic field that will oppose the change in the generating magnetic
field. The interaction of these two magnetic fields causes the ring to push

away 
from the coil, similar to the way in which the north poles of two
magnets push away from each other. For the lower ring, which has been

sawed through, an 
EMFis generated, but no current can result because of anincomplete path. Hence, no opposing magnetic field is produced by the ring.
Self-Inductance
Back-EMFcan be explained in another way. As Faraday showed, 
EMFisinduced whenever a wire cuts the lines of a magnetic field. The current

through the wire shown in 
Figure 25-12increases from Figure 25-12atoFigure 25-12c.The current generates a magnetic field, shown by magnetic
field lines. As the current and magnetic 
field increase, new 
lines are created.
As more lines are added, they cut through the coil wires and generate an EMFto oppose the current changes. The 
EMFwill make the potential of the topof the coil more negative than the bottom. This induction of 
EMFin a wirecarrying changing current is called self-inductance.
Figure 25-11
Current is inducedin the continuous metal ring, while
there is no current in the cut ring.Figure 25-12
As the current in the coil increases from 
(a)onthe left to (c)on the right, themagnetic field generated by the
current also increases. This

increase in the magnetic field
produces an 
EMFthat opposes
the current direction.abcHorizons Companies 679-685 CH25-S2-845813  3/30/04  9:44 PM  Page 681682Chapter 25Electromagnetic Induction
The size of the induced EMFis proportional to the rate at which fieldlines cut through the wires. The faster the current is changed, the larger the
opposing EMF. If the current reaches a steady value, the magnetic field is
constant, and the EMFis zero. When the current is decreased, an EMFis generated that tends to prevent the reduction in the magnetic field and

current. Because of self-inductance, work has to be done to increase the

current flowing through the coil. Energy is stored in the magnetic field.

This is similar to the way in which a charged capacitor stores energy in the

electric field between its plates.
Transformers
Transformers
are used to increase or decrease AC voltages. Usage of
transformers is common because they change voltages with relatively little

loss of energy. In fact, many of the devices in your home, such as game sys-

tems, printers, and stereos, have transformers inside their casings or as part

of their cords.
How transformers work
Self-inductance produces an EMFwhen currentchanges in a single coil. A transformer has two coils, electrically insulated
from each other, but wound around the same iron core. One coil is called

the primary coil.The other coil is called the secondary coil.When theprimary coil is connected to a source of AC voltage, the changing current

creates a changing magnetic field, which is carried through the core to the
secondary coil. In the secondary coil, the changing field induces a varying

EMF. This effect is called mutual inductance.
The EMFinduced in the secondary coil, called the secondary voltage, is
proportional to the primary voltage. The secondary voltage also depends

on the ratio of the number of turns on the secondary coil to the number
of turns on the primary coil, as shown by the following expressions.
sepcroimndaaryryvvooltlataggeeVVpsNNpsIf the secondary voltage is larger than the primary voltage, the transformer

is called a step-up transformer,
as shown in 
Figure 25-13a.If the volt-
age coming out of the transformer is smaller than the voltage put in, then

it is called a step-down transformer,
as shown in 
Figure 25-13b.

InequalitiesStudy the following expressions to help you understand the
relationships among voltage, current, and the number of coils in step-up
and step-down transformers.
Step-Up TransformerStep-Down Transformer
VpVsVpVsIpIsIpIsNpNsNpNsIn an ideal transformer, the electric power delivered to the secondary 
circuit equals the power supplied to the primary circuit. An ideal trans-
former dissipates no power itself, and can be represented by the following

equations:PpPsVpIpVsIsRearranging the equation to find the ratio 
Vp/Vsshows that the current in
the primary circuit depends on how much current is required by 

the secondary circuit. This relationship can be combined with the 
relationship shown earlier between voltage and the number of turns to

result in the following.
As mentioned previously, a step-up transformer increases voltage.
Because transformers cannot increase the power output, there must be a

corresponding decrease in current through the secondary circuit. Similarly,

in a step-down transformer, the current is greater in the secondary circuit

than it is in the primary circuit. A voltage decrease corresponds to a current

increase, as shown in the Connecting Math to Physics. Another way 

to understand this is to consider a transformer as 100 percent efficient, 

as is typically assumed in industry. Therefore, in most cases, it may 

be assumed that the input power and the output power are the same.

Figure 25-13illustrates the principles of step-up and step-down trans-

formers. As shown in 
Figure 25-14,some transformers can function eitheras step-up transformers or step-down transformers, depending on how

they are hooked up. Transformer Equation
IIpsVVpsNNpsThe ratio of the current in the secondary coil to the current in the primary coil
is equal to the ratio of the voltage in the primary coil to the secondary coil,

which is also equal to the ratio of the number of turns on the voltage in the

primary coil to the number of turns on the secondary coil.Common UnitsTransformers
typically are rated in volt-amps

Step-downtransformers are used to reducethe high voltages in transmission

lines to levels appropriate for
consumers at the points of use.
Everyday uses of transformers
As you learned in Chapter 22, long-distance
transmission of electrical energy is economical only if low currents and

very high voltages are used. Step-up transformers are used at power sources

to develop voltages as high as 480,000 V. High voltages reduce the current

required in the transmission lines, keeping the energy lost to resistance

low. When the energy reaches the consumer, step-down transformers, such

as those shown in 
Figure 25-15,provide appropriately low voltages for
consumer use. 
Transformers in home appliances further adjust voltages to useable levels.
If you have ever had to charge a toy or operate a personal electronic device,

you probably had to plug a large ÒblockÓ into the wall outlet. A trans-

former of the type discussed in this chapter is contained inside of that
block. In this case, it is probably reducing the household voltage of about

120 V to something in the 3-V to 26-V range.
Not all transformers are step-up or step-down. Transformers can be used
to isolate one circuit from another. This is possible because the wire of the

primary coil never makes direct contact with the wire of the secondary coil. 

This type of transformer would most likely be found in some small elec-

tronic devices.
Matt Meadows 679-685 CH25-S2-845813  6/8/04  3:59 PM  Page 685Induction and Transformers
A transformer is an electric device without any moving components. It is made 
of two electric circuits interlinked by a magnetic field. A transformer is used 

to increase or decrease an AC potential difference, which often is called 
voltage.
Transformers can be found everywhere. Every electronic device that plugs into

your household electric circuits incorporates a transformer, usually to lower the

voltage going to the device. Televisions that have standard cathode-ray picture

tubes incorporate high-voltage transformers, which raise the standard household

voltage to tens of thousands of volts. This accelerates electrons from the rear of

the tube to the screen. In this experiment, you will use two coils with a removable

iron core. One coil is called the primary coil, the other the secondary coil. When

an AC voltage is applied to the primary coil, the changing magnetic field induces

a current, and thus, a voltage in the secondary coil. This induced voltage is

expressed by 
Vs/VpNs/Np, where Nrefers to the number of turns in the coils.

Key Concepts
¥Michael Faraday discovered that if a wire moves through a magnetic field, 
an electric current can flow. 
¥The current produced depends upon the angle between the velocity of the

wire and the magnetic field. Maximum current occurs when the wire is
moving at right angles to the field. 
¥Electromotive force, 
EMF, is the potential difference created across themoving wire. 
EMFis measured in volts. 
¥The EMFin a straight length of wire moving through a uniform magnetic
field is the product of the magnetic field, B, the length of the wire, 
L, and the component of the velocity of the moving wire through the field that is

perpendicular to the field, v(sin ).¥Effective current and voltage can be used to describe alternating current 

and voltage.
¥A generator and a motor are similar devices. A generator converts mechanical

energy to electric energy, whereas a motor converts electric energy to

mechanical energy.

Vocabulary
isotopemass spectrometerAlthough you may not know what the terms stand for, you have 
probably heard of shortwave radio, micro
waves, 
and VHF and UHFtelevision signals. Each of these terms is used to describe one of the many

types of electromagnetic waves that are broadcast through the air to 
provide you with radio, television, and other forms of communication. 

All of these waves consist of electric and magnetic fields propagating

through space.
The key to understanding how these waves behave is understanding the
nature of the electron. Why? Because electromagnetic waves are produced

by accelerating electronsÑthe electronsÕ charge produces electric fields 

and the electronsÕ motion produces magnetic fields. Furthermore, the

waves are broadcast and received by antennas, devices made of matter that

also contains electrons. Thus, the logical first step in understanding how

electromagnetic waves are produced, propagated, received, and used for so

many devices is to learn about the properties of the electron.

Mass of an Electron
How do you determine the mass of something that cannot be seen with
the unaided eye and whose mass is so small that it cannot be measured
even by the most sensitive scale? Such was the challengeÑthat of deter-

mining the mass of an electronÑfacing physicists in the late 1800s. The

solution required a series of discoveries. The first piece of the puzzle came

from Robert Millikan. As described in Chapter 21, Millikan balanced

charged oil droplets in an electric field and was able to determine the

charge, 
q, of an electron (1.602
1019C). Next, British physicist J. J.
Thomson was able to determine the charge-to-mass ratio, 
q/m, of an elec-tron. Knowing both the charge-to-mass ratio, 
q/m, and the charge of anelectron, q, Thomson was able to calculate the mass of an electron.
ThomsonÕs experiments with electrons
In 1897, J.J. Thomson per-
formed the first experimental measurement of the charge-to-mass ratio of
an electron. Thomson used a cathode-ray tube, a device that generates a

stream of electrons. 
Figure 26-1 shows the setup used in the experiment.
In order to minimize collisions between the electron beam and the mole-

cules in the air, Thomson removed virtually all of the air from within the

glass tube.
Inside the cathode-ray tube, an electric field is produced by a large
potential difference between the cathode and anode. Electrons are emitted

from the cathode and are accelerated toward the anodes by the electric

field. Some of the electrons pass through slits in the anodes, forming 

a narrow beam. When the electrons reach the end of the tube they strike a

fluorescent coating, causing it to glow.
Thomson used electric and magnetic fields to exert force on and deflectthe electron beam as it passed through the tube. The electric field, which

was produced by charged parallel plates, was oriented perpendicular to 

the beam. The electric field (of strength E) produced a force (equal to qE)that acted on the electrons and deflected them upward, toward the positive

plate. The magnetic field was produced by two electromagnets and was 

oriented at right angles to both the beam and the electric field. Recall 

from Chapter 24 that the force exerted by a magnetic field is perpendicu-

lar to the field and to the direction of motion of the electrons. Thus, 

the magnetic field (of strength B) produced a force (equal to Bqv, where vis the electron velocity) that acted on the electrons and deflected 
them downward. 
696-704 CH26-S1-845813  6/8/04  4:20 PM  Page 698The electric and magnetic fields could be adjusted until the beam ofelectrons followed a straight, or undeflected, path. When this occurred, the
forces due to the two fields were equal in magnitude and opposite in direc-

tion. Mathematically, this can be represented as follows:
BqvEqSolving this equation for vyields the following expression:
vBEqqBEThis equation shows that the forces are balanced only for electrons that

have a specific velocity, 
v. If the electric field is turned off, only the forcedue to the magnetic field remains. The magnetic force is perpendicular to

the direction of motion of the electrons, causing them to undergo cen-

tripetal (center-directed) acceleration. The accelerating electrons follow a

circular path of radius r. Using NewtonÕs second law of motion, the fol-
lowing equation can be written to describe the electronÕs path:
Bqvmrv2Solving for q/mresults in the following equation.
Thomson calculated the straight trajectory velocity, 
v, using measuredvalues of 
Eand B. Next, he measured the distance between the spot formed
by the undeflected beam and the spot formed when the magnetic field

acted on the beam. Using this distance, he calculated the radius of the 

electronÕs circular path, 
r. Knowing the value of 
r, Thomson was able to 
calculate q/m. By averaging many experimental trials, he determined that
q/m1.7591011C/kg. Using this value for 
q/mand the known value of 
q,the mass of the electron (m) was calculated.
mq/qm11.7.650921100111C9/Ckg9.107
1031kgm9.11
1031kg ThomsonÕs experiments with protons
Thomson also used his cathode-ray test apparatus to determine the charge-to-mass ratio for positive ions.

He took advantage of the fact that positively charged particles undergo the

opposite deflection experienced by electrons moving through an electric or

magnetic field. The differing deflection of electrons and positive ions can

be seen in Figure 26-2.To accelerate positively charged particles into the deflection region,
Thomson reversed the direction of the electric field between the cathode

and anodes. He also added a small amount of hydrogen gas to the tube.

The electric field pulled electrons off the hydrogen atoms, changing the

atoms into positive ions. These positive hydrogen ions, or protons, were then

accelerated through a tiny slit in the anode. The resulting proton beam passed

through electric and magnetic fields on its way toward the end of the tube.
Charge-to-Mass Ratio in a Thomson Tube
mqBvrIn a Thomson tube, the ratio of an electronÕs charge to its mass is equal to
the ratio of the electronÕs velocity divided by the product of the magnetic field
strength and the radius of the electronÕs circular path.Section 26.1Interactions of Electric and Magnetic Fields and Matter

An interesting thing happened when Thomson put neon gas into thecathode-ray tubeÑhe observed two glowing dots on the screen instead of
one. Each dot corresponded to a unique charge-to-mass ratio; that is, he

was able to calculate two different values for 
q/m. Thomson concluded that different atoms of the same element could have identical chemical

properties, but have different masses. Each of the differing forms of 

the same atom, with the same chemical properties but different masses, is

an isotope.
A device similar to ThomsonÕs cathode-ray tube that is commonly 
used to study isotopes is the mass spectrometer.
The mass spectrometeris able to precisely measure the charge-to-mass ratios of positive ions.

From the charge-to-mass ratio, the mass of each isotope can be calculated.
The material under investigation is called the ion source, as it is used to

produce the positive ions. The ion source must either be a gas or a material

that can be heated to form a vapor. The positive ions are formed when

accelerated electrons strike the gas or vapor atoms. The collisions knock

electrons off the atoms, forming positive ions. A potential difference, 
V,between the electrodes produces an electric field that is used to accelerate

the ions.

(b).696-704 CH26-S1-845813  6/8/04  4:22 PM  Page 701To select ions with a specific velocity, the ions first are made to pass
through electric and magnetic deflecting fields, as in ThomsonÕs cathode-
ray tube. Ions that pass undeflected through these two fields then move

into a region that is subject only to a uniform magnetic field. There, the

ions follow a circular path. The radii of the paths can be used to determine

the charge-to-mass ratios of the ions. The path radius, 
r, for an ion can becalculated from NewtonÕs second law of motion.

Br2mqVThis equation can be used to determine the charge-to-mass ratio of an ion. As shown in Figure 26-3, in one type of mass spectrometer, the ions
strike a plate of photographic film, where they leave a mark. The diameter
of the curved path traveled by the ions in the vacuum chamber can be eas-

ily measured because it is the distance between the mark made on the film

and the slit in the electrode. Therefore, the radius of the path, 
r, is half ofthis measured distance.

for an ionized chromium (Cr) sample is shown in 
Figure 26-4.The fourdistinct red marks indicate that a naturally occurring sample of chromiumis composed of four isotopes. The width of the mark corresponds to the

abundance of the isotope. Note that the isotope with a mass number of 52

is the most abundant isotope, and that the sum of the percentages for the

four isotopes equals 100 percent. As you may recall from chemistry, the

mass of each element listed in the periodic tableis actually a weighted aver-
age of the masses of all of the stable isotopes of that element. Note that all of the chromium ions that hit the film have the same charge.
Their charge depends on how many electrons were removed from the 

neutral chromium atoms used as the ion source. Recall that the ions are

formed when accelerated electrons are used to knock electrons off neutral
atoms. After the first electron is removed, producing a singly ionized (1
)atom, more energy is required to remove the second electron and produce

a double ionized (2) atom. This additional energy can be provided by
electrons that undergo a greater acceleration because they are subjected 
to a greater electric field. Thus, higher-energy accelerated electrons can 

produce both singly and doubly charged ions. In this way, the operator of

the mass spectrometer can choose the charge on the ion to be studied.Other applicationsMass spectrometers have numerous applications. For
example, a mass spectrometer can be used to ÒpurifyÓ a sample of uranium
into its component isotopes. Rather than striking a detector to measure 

relative abundance, the separated isotopes are collected. The different 

isotopes are, in turn, used in varying applications. Mass spectrometers also

are used to detect and identify trace amounts of molecules in a sample, an

application extensively used in the environmental and forensic sciences.

The device is so sensitive that researchers are able to separate ions with

mass differences as small as one ten-thousandth of one percent and are
able to identify the presence of a single molecule within a 10 billion-

molecule sample.

705Although you probably do not realize it, you rely on electromagnetic 
waves every day. Signals broadcast from television and radio stations,
orbiting satellites, and even those emanating from distant galaxies are all
electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves also are used in common

consumer products, such as micro
waves ovens, remote-control garage door
openers, and cellular phones, to name a few. In this section, you will learn

about the fields that make up electromagnetic waves, and how the waves

are produced and received.
Electromagnetic Waves
Great advancements in the understanding of electromagnetic waves
were made during the nineteenth century. These advancements led to the

development of new devices and technologies that had a huge impact on

modern society.
A series of breakthroughs
In 1821, while performing a demonstration
for his students, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed that an
electric current caused the needle in a nearby compass to deflect. Oersted

realized that his observation displayed a fundamental connection between

electricity and magnetism. He concluded that an electric current in a con-
ductor produces a magnetic field, and that a changing electric current 
produces a changing magnetic field. OerstedÕs discovery created excitement

in the scientific community and led to a flood of new research.Eleven years after Oersted, Englishman Michael Faraday, and American
high school physics teacher John Henry independently discovered induc-

tion. Induction is the production of an electric field due to a moving mag-

netic field. Interestingly, induced electric fields exist even if there is not a

wire present, as shown in 
Figure 26-5a.Thus, a changing magnetic field
produces a corresponding changing electric field. Notice that the field lines
of the induced electric field, shown in Figure 26-5a, are closed loops. This

is because, unlike an electrostatic field, there are no charges on which the

field lines begin or end.Figure 26-5
These diagrams

15.What is the speed in air of an electromagnetic wave having a
frequency of 3.2
1019Hz?16.
What is the wavelength of green light having a frequency of

5.70
1014Hz?17.
An electromagnetic wave has a frequency of 8.2
1014Hz. What is the wavelength of the wave?
18.
What is the frequency of an electromagnetic wave having a

wavelength of 2.2102m?In 1860, Scottish physicist James Maxwell postulated that the opposite
of induction is also true; that is, that a changing electric field produces a
changing magnetic field. This is shown in 
Figure 26-5bon the previouspage. Maxwell also suggested that charges were not necessaryÑa changing

electric field alone would produce the magnetic field. He then predictedthat both accelerating charges and changing magnetic fields would pro-

duce electric and magnetic fields that move through space.
A combined electric and magnetic field that travels through space is an
electromagnetic wave,
or EM wave. The orientations of the fields making
up an electromagnetic wave are shown in 
Figure 26-5c on the previouspage. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, experimentally confirmed

that MaxwellÕs theory was correct. MaxwellÕs theory led to a complete

description of electricity and magnetism.Electromagnetic wave properties
The speed of an electromagnetic wave
later was found to be approximately 3.00
108m/s, now denoted as 
c, thespeed of light. Light, a type of electromagnetic wave, and all other forms of
electromagnetic waves, travel through space at 
c. The wavelength of an 
electromagnetic wave, its frequency, and the speed of light all are related.
In this equation, the wavelength, 
, is measured in m; the speed, v, is meas-ured in m/s; and the frequency, 
f, is measured in Hz. Note that for an electromagnetic wave traveling in air or a vacuum, the speed, 
v, is equalto c, the speed of light. Thus, for an electromagnetic wave, the equation
becomes the following:
cfIn the equation, c3.00108m/s.
Note that in the wavelength-frequency equation, the product of fre-
quency and wavelength is constantÑequal to 
cÑfor any electromagnetic
wave. 
Thus, as wavelength increases, frequency decreases, and vice-versa. In
other words, an electromagnetic wave with a long wavelength has a low
frequency, whereas an electromagnetic wave with a short wavelength has 

a high frequency.
Wavelength-Frequency Relationship for a Wave
vfThe wavelength of a wave is equal to its speed divided by its frequency.

What is the speed of light traveling through water?
21.The speed of light traveling through a material is 2.43

Electromagnetic wave propagation through matter
Electromagneticwaves also can travel through matter. Sunlight shining through a glass of
water is an example of light waves traveling through three different forms

of matter: air, glass, and water. Air, glass, and water are nonconducting

materials known as 
dielectrics.
The velocity of an electromagnetic wave
through a dielectric is always less than the speed of the wave in a vacuum,

and it can be calculated using the following equation:
vcKIn this equation, the wave velocity, 
v, is measured in m/s; the speed oflight, c, has a value of 3.00
108m/s; and the relative dielectric constant,
K, is a dimensionless quantity. In a vacuum, 
K1.00000, and the wave
velocity is equal to 
c. In air, 
K1.00054, and electromagnetic waves move
just slightly slower than 
c. Electric fieldAntennaFigure 26-6
An alternatingcurrent source connected to theantenna produces a varying

potential difference in the antenna.
This varying potential difference

generates a varying electric field

(a).The varying electric field
produces a changing magnetic

field (not shown), and this
magnetic field, in turn, generates

an electric field. This process

continues and the electromagnetic

wave propagates away from the

antenna, (b)and (c).Section 26.2Electric and Magnetic Fields in Space
707Electromagnetic wave propagation through space
The formation of anelectromagnetic wave is shown in 
Figure 26-6.An antenna,which is awire designed to transmit or receive electromagnetic waves, is connected to

an alternating current (AC) source. The AC source produces a varying

potential difference in the antenna that alternates at the frequency of the
AC source. This varying potential difference generates a corresponding

varying electric field that propagates away from the antenna. The changing

electric field also generates a varying magnetic field perpendicular to the

page. Although the magnetic field is not shown in Figure 26-6, it also

propagates away from the antenna. The combined electric and magnetic

fields are electromagnetic waves that spread out into space, moving at the

speed of light.abc705-713 CH26-S2-845813  3/12/04  8:17 AM  Page 707Axis ofpolarizationEvvEEEBBBBFigure 26-7

that is, its electric field is parallel to the antennaÕs conductor.

Producing Electromagnetic Waves
Waves from an AC source
As you just learned, an AC source connected
to an antenna can transmit electromagnetic waves. The wave frequency is
equal to the frequency of the rotating AC generator and is limited to about 

1 kHz. The range of frequencies and wavelengths that make up all forms

of electromagnetic radiation is shown in 
Figure 26-8and is called theelectromagnetic spectrum.Waves from a coil and a capacitor
A common method of generatinghigh-frequency electromagnetic waves is to use a coil and a capacitor 
connected in a series circuit. If the capacitor is charged by a battery, the

potential difference across the capacitor creates an electric field. When the
battery is removed, the capacitor discharges as the stored electrons flow

through the coil, creating a magnetic field. When the capacitor is discharged,
the coilÕs magnetic field collapses. A back-
EMF then develops and recharges
the capacitor in the opposite direction, and the process is repeated. When an
antenna is connected across the capacitor, the fields of the capacitor are trans-

mitted into space. One complete oscillation cycle is shown in 
Figure 26-9.Table 26-1

The motion of 
a pendulum is analogous to theaction of electrons in a coil-and-
capacitor circuit. Motion of the

pendulumÕs bob is analogous to
the current flow in the circuit (a).The point where the pendulumÕs

motion comes to a stop is

analogous to zero current in 
the circuit (b).The process occurring in the coil-and-capacitor circuit can be comparedwith the cyclic oscillations of a swinging pendulum, as shown in 
Figure26-10.
Assume that the electrons in the coil and capacitor are representedby the pendulumÕs bob. The moving bob has the greatest speed at the bot-

tom of its swing, a position at which kinetic energy, 
KE, is maximized, andpotential energy, 
PE, due to gravity is zero. This point in the pendulumÕs
motion, shown in 
Figure 26-10a,
is similar to the peak electric currentflow in the coil when the charge on the capacitor is zero. When the bob

reaches the peak of its swing, its vertical displacement and 
PEare maxi-mized, whereas its KEis zero because the bobÕs velocity is zero. As shown
in Figure 26-10b,
this point in the motion is similar to when the capaci-tor holds the maximum charge and the current through the coil is zero.Energy in the coil-and-capacitor circuit
As you just learned, the 
PEofthe pendulum is largest when its vertical displacement is greatest, and theKEis largest when the velocity is greatest. The sum of the 
PEand KEÑthetotal energyÑis constant throughout the motion of the pendulum. In thecoil-and-capacitor circuit, both the magnetic field produced by the coil

and the electric field in the capacitor contain energy. When the current is

largest, the energy stored in the magnetic field is greatest. When the current
is zero, the electric field of the capacitor is largest, and all the energy is con-
tained in the electric field. The total energy of the circuit (the sum of themagnetic field energy, the 
electric field energy, the thermal losses, and the
energy carried away by the generated electromagnetic waves) is constant.

Energy that is carried, or radiated, in the form of electromagnetic waves is

frequently called electromagnetic radiation.Just as a pendulum eventually stops swinging if it is left alone, the 
oscillations in a coil and capacitor die out over time due to resistance in the

circuit. The oscillations of both systems can be made to continue by adding

energy. Gentle pushes, 
applied at the correct times, will keep a pendulum
swinging. The largest amplitude swings occur when the frequency of pushesmatches the frequency of swinging motion. This is the condition of reso-
nance, which was discussed in Chapter 14. Similarly, voltage pulses

applied to the coil-and-capacitor circuit at the right frequency keep the
oscillations in the circuit going. One way of doing this is to add a second

coil to the circuit, to form a transformer. A transformer is shown in 
Figure26-11.
The alternating current induced in the secondary coil is increased by
an amplifier and added back to the coil and capacitor. This type of circuit

can produce frequencies up to approximately 400 MHz.Frequencies
The Federal
Communications Commission
(FCC) assigns each radio and 

TV station a carrier wave with 

a specific frequency. A station

broadcasts by varying its carrier

wave. When the wave is received

by your radio or TV set, the carrier

wave is stripped away and the
information from the wave is
processed so that you can see 

or hear it.ab705-713 CH26-S2-845813  3/12/04  8:19 AM  Page 710Section 26.2Electric and Magnetic Fields in Space
711Figure 26-11
In a transformer,
the amplified oscillation from thesecondary coil is in resonance

with the coil-and-capacitor circuit
and keeps the oscillations going.Waves from a resonant cavity
The oscillation frequency produced by a
coil-and-capacitor circuit can be increased by decreasing the size of the coil
and capacitor used. However, above frequencies of 1 GHz, individual coils

and capacitors can no longer be used. High frequency microwaves, 
withfrequencies from 1 GHz to 100 GHz, are produced using a resonant cavity.

The resonant cavity is a rectangular box that acts as both a coil and a 

capacitor. The size of the box determines the frequency of oscillation.

Microwave ov
ens have resonant cavities that produce the micro
waves used
to cook food.To produce even higher frequency infrared waves, the size of the reso-
nant cavity would have to be reduced to molecular size. The oscillating

electrons that produce infrared waves are, in fact, within the molecules.

Visible and ultraviolet 
waves are generated by electrons within atoms. 
X rays and gamma rays are the result of accelerating charges in the nuclei

of atoms. All electromagnetic waves arise from accelerated charges, and all

travel at the speed of light.
Waves from piezoelectricity
Coils and capacitors are not the only methodof generating oscillation voltages. Quartz crystals deform when a voltage is
applied across them, a property known as 
piezoelectricity. The applica-tion of an AC voltage to a cut section of quartz crystal results in sustained

oscillations. An inverse linear relationship exists between crystal thickness

and oscillation frequency. Just as a piece of metal vibrates at a specific fre-

quency when it is bent and released, so does a quartz crystal. A crystal can

be cut so that it vibrates at a specific desired frequency. An applied voltage

deforms the crystal and starts the vibrations. The piezoelectric property

also generates an EMFwhen the crystal is deformed. Because this 
EMFisproduced at the vibrating frequency of the crystal, it can be amplified and

returned to the crystal to keep it vibrating. Because of their nearly constant

frequencies of vibration, quartz crystals commonly are used in watches.

705-713 CH26-S2-845813  6/8/04  4:26 PM  Page 711Reception of Electromagnetic Waves
Now that you know how electromagnetic waves are produced and trans-
mitted, how do you suppose the waves are detected? As you may have
guessed, reception involves an antenna. As shown in 
Figure 26-12,the waveÕs electric fields accelerate the electrons of the material making up

the antenna. The acceleration is largest when the antenna is positioned inthe same direction as the wave polarization; that is, when it is parallel to 

the direction of the waveÕs 
electric fields. A potential difference across the
terminals of the antenna oscillates at the frequency of the electromagnetic
wave. 
This voltage is largest when the length of the antenna is one-half the
wavelength of the wave it is to detect. Thus, an antennaÕs length is designed

to be one-half of the wavelength of the wave it is supposed to receive. For

this reason, an antenna designed to receive radio and television waves is

much longer than one designed to receive micro
waves.
While a simple wire antenna can detect electromagnetic waves, several
wires are more effective. A television antenna often consists of two or more

wires spaced about one-quarter wavelength apart. Electric fields that are

generated in the individual wires form constructive interference patterns

that increase the strength of the signal.It is important to realize that all electromagnetic waves, not just visible
light waves, undergo reflection, refraction, and diffraction. Thus, it should

not be a surprise to learn that dish antennas, like the one shown at the

beginning of this chapter, reflect very short 
wavelength electromagnetic 
signals, just as parabolic mirrors reflect visible light waves. A dish antennaÕs

large surface area for collecting and focusing waves makes it well-suited to

receive weak radio signals. A parabolic dish antenna works by reflecting

and focusing the received signals off its surface and into a device called 

the horn. The horn, which is supported by a tripod structure over the main

dish, contains a short dipole antenna. The horn channels the signals to 
a receiver,
a device consisting of an antenna, a coil-and-capacitor circuit,a detector to decode the signal, and an amplifier. 
Selection of waves
As you know, many different radio and television sta-
tions transmit electromagnetic waves at the same time. If the information
being broadcast is to be understood, the waves of a particular station must

be selected. To select waves of a particular frequency (and reject the others)

a tuner uses a coil-and-capacitor circuit connected to an antenna. The capac-
itance is adjusted until the oscillation frequency of the circuit equals the
frequency of the desired wave. When this is done, only waves of the desired

frequency can cause significant oscillations of the electrons in the circuit. Energy from waves
Waves carry energy as well as information. At micro
waveand infrared frequencies, waves accelerate electrons in molecules. The
energy of the waves is converted to thermal energy in the molecules. This

is how micro
wave ov
ens cook food. Light waves also can transfer energy to electrons. Photographic film
makes use of this fact by using the energy in light waves to drive a chemi-

cal reaction within the film. The result is a permanent record of the light
from the subject that strikes the film. At higher frequencies, ultraviolet

(UV) radiation causes many chemical reactions to occur, including those

in living cells that produce sunburn and tanning.712Chapter 26Electromagnetism

Biology ConnectionBiology Connection705-713 CH26-S2-845813  3/12/04  8:20 AM  Page 712X Rays
In 1895, German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen sent electrons through an
evacuated glass tube, similar to the one shown in 
Figure 26-13.Roentgen
used a very high voltage across the tube to give the electrons large kinetic
energies. When the electrons struck the metal anode target within the tube,

Roentgen noticed a glow on a phosphorescent screen a short distance

away. 
The glow continued even when a piece of wood was placed between
the tube and the screen. He concluded that some kind of highly penetrat-
ing rays were coming from the tube.
Because Roentgen did not know what these strange rays were, he called
them X rays. A few weeks later, Roentgen found that photographic plates

were darkened by X r
ays. He also discov
ered that soft body tissue was 
transparent to the rays, but that bone blocked them. He produced an X-ray

picture of his wifeÕs hand. Within months, doctors recognized the valuable

medical uses of this phenomenon. It now is known that an X rayis a high-frequency electromagnetic wave.
In an X-ray tube, electrons first are accelerated to high speeds by means of

potential differences of 20,000 V or more. When the electrons crash into

matter, their kinetic energies are converted into the very high-frequency

electromagnetic waves called X rays.
Electrons are accelerated to these speeds in cathode-ray tubes, such as
the picture tube in a television. When the electrons hit the inside surface
of a television screenÕs face plate, they come to a sudden stop and cause the

colored phosphors to glow. This sudden stopping of the electrons also can

produce harmful X rays. Thus, the face-plate glass in a television screen

contains lead to stop the X rays and protect the viewers.

The electromagnetic spectrum consists of many types of electromagnetic radiation,
each of which can be classified by its frequency or wavelength. Gamma rays have

the highest frequency and energy, and have wavelengths that are a fraction of a

nanometer. Following gamma rays in order of increasing wavelength (decreasing

frequency and energy) are the following forms of electromagnetic radiation: 

X rays, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, micro
waves, 
and radio waves. Only wave-
lengths that fall within the range of visible light can be detected by the human

eyeÑall other forms of radiation are invisible. 
Electromagnetic receivers, such as those used in radios and televisions, detect
waves with an antenna. Because every electrical device with a changing or alternat-

ing current radiates electromagnetic waves, waves from these sources can interfere

with the reception of a desired signal. Some materials are effective at blocking or

shielding radio waves. In this lab you will investigate the radio wave shielding

effectiveness of various materials.

wire screen so that it forms a four-sided box
shape with open ends. Use staples to hold 

connecting edges of the screen together. 

Make sure the wire box is big enough for 
the radio to fit inside. Next, cut a piece of wire
screen to fit over each open end. Staple one 

of these pieces in place over one of the ends,

making sure to leave no openings. Then, staple

one edge of the remaining piece of wire screen
to the other end of the wire box. This piece of

screen will act as a door that can be opened

Cellular PhonesCellular PhonesDo you own a cellular phone?
Once rareand expensive, cell phones are now common-
place and relatively affordable. Approximately

20 percent of American teenagers have one.
Cellular Networks
The cell phone gets itsname from the way cell-phone companies divide

a city into small regions called cells.
Each cell isa hexagon-shaped zone within a larger hexago-
nal grid. Cells are typically about 26 square
kilometers in area, though they vary in size

depending on terrain and the number of cell
phone users. Located within each cell is a base

station, consisting of a tall tower-like structure

and boxes or buildings that
contain radio equipment.
When you 
make a call,the signal from your

phone is 
transmit-ted to the base 
station located
within your cell.

This signal then is
transmitted from
the local base 
station to the base
station where the
person you are 

calling is located.How then, do cell
phones communicate
with base stations? Cell
phones use radio wav
es to transmit informa-tion to and receive information from base 

stations. A cell phone is essentially a two-way

radio containing both a radio transmitter and 
a radio receiver. The cell-phone transmitter

takes the sound of your voice, encodes it onto

a radio-frequency wave and then transmits the

radio wave to a 
nearby base station. The base
station then relays 
the signal to the destinationbase station by 
broadcasting radio waves
through the air. On the receiving end of the 

call, the cell phone picks up 
the radio signal,decodes it, and reconverts it into audible

sounds you can understand. By making use 

of two different frequencies (one frequency 

for talking and one frequency for listening)
both people connected by the call can talk 

at the same time.
A cellular phone companyÕs system of base
stations can relay your call all the way across

the country, even when both people involved

in the call are moving. When you move from

cell to cell, the signal is automatically relayed

to the correct base station in the system.
Risks of Cell Phone Use
Using a cellphone is not a risk-free activity. For example,

driving while talking on a cell phone is danger-
ous. One study found that people talking on

their cell phones while driving were four times

more likely to be involved in an accident than

non-cell phone users. Some service stations post
warning signs prohibiting cell
phone use. Static electricity
generated by the cell phone
might cause the gasolinefumes to ignite.
Another potentialrisk is more contro-
versial.
 Because cell
phones broadcast
radio waves, 
they emit electromagnetic
energy known as

radio-frequency (RF)energy. There is some
evidence that cell phonesemit enough radiation tocause severe health problems,
such as brain cancer andAlzheimerÕs disease. There is evidence 
support-ing both sides of the debate. Currently, no 

one knows for certain what the long-term

health effects of cell phone use are, if any.

¥The ratio of charge to mass of an electron was measured by J.J. Thomson
using balanced electric and magnetic fields in a cathode-ray tube. 
¥An electronÕs mass can be found by combining ThomsonÕs result with

MillikanÕs measurement of the electronÕs charge. 
¥Atoms of the same element can have different masses.
¥The mass spectrometer uses both electric and magnetic fields to measure the
masses of ionized atoms and molecules.
¥The mass spectrometer can be used to determine the charge-to-mass ratio of
an ion.mqB22Vr2mqBvrKey Concepts
¥Electromagnetic waves are coupled, changing electric and magnetic fields

that move through space. 
¥The wavelength of a wave is equal to its speed divided by its frequency. 
For an electromagnetic wave traveling in a vacuum, the speed in the above
equation, v, is equal to the speed of light, c.¥The velocity of an electromagnetic wave through a dielectric is less than the

speed of light in a vacuum.
¥A changing current in a transmitting antenna is used to generate
electromagnetic waves. 
¥Electromagnetic radiation can transmit energy and information through 
a medium or a vacuum.
¥Piezoelectricity is the property of a crystal causing it to bend or deform and

produce electrical vibrations when a voltage is applied across it.
¥Receiving antennas convert electromagnetic waves to varying electric fields 

in conductors. 
¥Electromagnetic waves can be detected by the 
EMFthat they produce in an antenna. Particular frequencies of electromagnetic waves can be selected

by using a resonating coil-and-capacitor circuit, known as a tuner.
¥A receiver obtains transmitted information from electromagnetic waves.
¥The length of the most efficient antenna is one-half the wavelength of the
wave to be 
detected. ¥Microwave 
and infrared waves can accelerate electrons in molecules, thereby
producing thermal energy. 
¥X rays are high-frequency electromagnetic waves emitted by rapidly

accelerated electrons.

radar guns to catch speeding drivers. A radar gun is

a device that uses a high-frequency electromagnetic
signal to measure the speed of a moving object. 

The frequency of the radar gunÕs transmitted signal

is known. This transmitted signal reflects off of the

moving object and returns to the receiver on the

radar gun. Because the object is moving relative to

the radar gun, the frequency of the returned signal
is different from that of the originally transmitted
signal. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler

shift. When the object is moving toward the radar

gun, the frequency of the returned signal is greater
than the frequency of the original signal. If the
initial transmitted signal has a frequency of 10.525

GHz and the returned signal shows a Doppler shift

of 1850 Hz, what is the speed of the moving object?

Compton effectJames MaxwellÕs electromagnetic wave theory, which you learned about

in the previous chapter, was proven to be correct by the experiments of 
Heinrich Hertz in 1889. Light was then firmly established as an electro-

magnetic wave. All of optics, including phenomena such as interference,

diffraction, and polarization, seemed to be explainable in terms of the
electromagnetic wave theory.
Problems remained for physicists, however, because MaxwellÕs notion 
of light as a purely electromagnetic wave could not explain several other

important phenomena. These problems generally involved the absorption

or emission of electromagnetic radiation. Two such problems were the

emission spectrum given off by a hot body (hot object) and the discharge

of electrically charged particles from a metal surface when ultraviolet 

radiation was incident upon it. As you will learn, these phenomena could

be explained once it was understood that electromagnetic waves have 

particle-like properties in addition to wavelike properties.

Radiation from Incandescent Bodies
Why was the radiation emitted from a hot body puzzling to physicists?
The problem had to do with the intensity and frequency of the emittedradiation at different temperatures. MaxwellÕs electromagnetic wave theory

could not account for the observed radiation emissions of hot bodies.

What then, is the nature of the radiation emitted by hot bodies? 
The lightbulb that you observed in the Launch Lab at the start of this
chapter is an example of a hot body. As predicted by electromagnetic theory,

light and infrared radiation are emitted by the vibrating charged particles

within the filament. The filament glows because it is hot, and it is said to

be incandescent; hence, the name incandescent lightbulb.The colors that

you see depend upon the relative intensities of the emitted electromagnetic

waves of various frequencies, and the sensitivity of your eyes to those waves.
When the dimmer control is used to increase the voltage to the bulb, the
temperature of the glowing filament increases. As a result, the color changes

from deep red to orange to yellow and finally, to white. This color change

occurs because the higher-temperature filament emits higher-frequency radi-
ation. The higher-frequency radiation comes from the higher-frequency end

of the visible spectrum (the violet end) and results in the filament appear-
ing to be whiter.
What would you expect to see if you viewed the glowing filament
through a diffraction grating? When viewed in this way, all of the colors of

the rainbow would be visible. The bulb also emits infrared radiation that

you would not see. A plot of the intensity of the light emitted from a hot body

over a range of frequencies is known as an 
emission spectrum.Emissionspectra of the incandescent body at temperatures of 4000 K, 5800 K, and
8000 K are shown in 
Figure 27-1.Note that at each temperature, there is
a frequency at which the maximum amount of energy is emitted. If you

compare the location of each curveÕs maximum, you will see that as the

temperature increases, the frequency at which the maximum amount of

energy is emitted also increases.
722-734 CH27-S1-845813  3/12/04  6:44 AM  Page 724The total power emitted by a hot body also increases with temperature.
The power (the energy emitted per second) of an electromagnetic wave is
proportional to the hot bodyÕs kelvin temperature raised to the fourth

power, 
T4. Thus, hotter bodies radiate considerably more power than do
cooler bodies. Probably the most common example of a hot body radiat-

ing a great amount of power is the Sun, a dense ball of gases heated to

incandescence by the energy produced within it. The SunÕs surface temper-

ature is 5800 K, and it radiates 41026W of power, an enormous quantity.
On average, each square meter of EarthÕs surface receives about 1000 J of

energy per second (1000 W), enough to power ten 100-W lightbulbs.
The problem with MaxwellÕs electromagnetic theory was that it is unable
to explain the shape of the spectrum shown in Figure 27-1. Between 1887

and 1900, many physicists used existing classical physics theories to try 

to explain the shape. They all failed. In 1900, German physicist Max Planck

found that he could calculate the spectrum if he introduced a revolutionary

hypothesis: that atoms are not able to continuously change their energy.

Planck assumed that the vibrational energy of the atoms in a solid could
have only specific frequencies, as shown by the following equation.
In the equation, fis the frequency of vibration of the atom, his a constant, called PlanckÕs constant, with a value of 6.626
1034J/Hz, and nis an integer such as 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . n0:  E(0)hf0n1:  E(1)hfhfn2:  E(2)hf2hfn3:  E(3)hf3hfand so onThus, the energy, 
E, can have the values
hf, 2hf, 3hf, and so on, but never
values such as 
23hfor 34hf. In other words, energy is 
quantizedÑit exists onlyin bundles of specific amounts. 
his usually rounded to 6.631034J/Hzfor calculations.
Planck also proposed that atoms do not always radiate electromagnetic
waves when they are vibrating, as predicted by Maxwell. Instead, Planck

proposed that atoms emit radiation only when their vibrational energy
changes. For example, if the energy of an atom changes from 3
hfto 2hf, theatom emits radiation. The energy radiated is equal to the change in energy
of the atom, in this case hf.Planck found that the constant, h, has an extremely small value. This
means that the energy-changing steps are too small to be noticeable in
ordinary bodies. Still, the introduction of quantized energy was extremely

troubling to physicists, especially to Planck himself. It was the first hint

that the classical physics of Newton and Maxwell might be valid only

under certain conditions. Planck was honored for his groundbreaking 

theory of quantized energy with a Nobel prize in 1918 and, more recently,

with the postage stamp shown in 
Figure 27-2.Energy of VibrationEnhfThe energy of a vibrating atom is equal to the product of an integer, PlanckÕs
constant, and the frequency of the vibration.
Temperature of the Universe
The universe is filled with the
radiation that was emitted when 
it was a very hot object. Currently,

the emission spectrum of the
universe matches that of a body

with a temperature of 2.7 K. This

is very cold. As you may recall, 0 K

is the lowest possible temperature

on the Kelvin temperature scale

and is known as absolute zero.Astronomy ConnectionAstronomy ConnectionFigure 27-2

and is used by photographers to
measure light levels (b).abThe Photoelectric Effect
Physicists of the early 1900s also were challenged by another troubling
experimental result that could not be explained by MaxwellÕs wave theory.
When ultraviolet radiation was incident on a negatively charged zinc plate,

the plate discharged. When ordinary visible light was incident on the same

charged plate, the plate did not discharge. This result was contrary to elec-

tromagnetic theory. Both ultraviolet radiation and visible light are forms of

electromagnetic radiation, so why would the zinc plate be discharged by

one but not by the other? And why would a positively charged zinc plate

not be similarly discharged? Further study showed that the negatively

charged zinc plate was discharging by emitting or ejecting electrons. The

emission of electrons when electromagnetic radiation falls on an object is
called the photoelectric effect.The photoelectric effect can be studied in a photocell, such as the oneshown in 
Figure 27-3.The cell contains two metal electrodes sealed in a
tube from which the air has been removed. The evacuated tube keeps the

metal surfaces from oxidizing and keeps the electrons from being slowed

or stopped by particles in the air. The larger electrode, the cathode, usually

is coated with cesium or another alkali metal. The smaller electrode, the

anode, is made of a thin wire so that it blocks only a very small amount of

radiation. The tube often is made of quartz so as to allow ultraviolet wave-

lengths to pass through it. A potential difference placed across the elec-
trodes attracts electrons to the anode.
When no radiation falls on the cathode, there is no current in the cir-
cuit. When radiation falls on the cathode, a current is produced, which is

measured by the ammeter, as shown in Figure 27-3. The current is pro-

duced because the photoelectric effect causes the ejection of electrons, also

called photoelectrons, from the cathode. The flow of electrons is the cur-

rent in the circuit. The electrons travel to the anode, the positive electrode.
Threshold frequency
Not all radiation falling on the cathode results in acurrent. Electrons are ejected from the cathode only if the frequency of theradiation is greater than a certain minimum value, called the 
thresholdfrequency,
f0. The threshold frequency varies widely, depending on the
type of metal. For example, all wavelengths of visible light except red will

eject electrons from cesium, but no wavelength of visible light will eject

electrons from zinc. Higher-frequency ultraviolet radiation is needed to

produce the photoelectric effect in zinc.726Chapter 27Quantum Theory
Horizons Companies 722-734 CH27-S1-845813  3/12/04  6:47 AM  Page 726No matter how intense, radiation with a frequency below 
f0will notcause the ejection of electrons from metal. Conversely, even very low-
intensity radiation with a frequency at or above the threshold frequency

causes the immediate ejection of electrons. When the incident radiationÕs

frequency is equal to or greater than the threshold frequency, increasing

the intensity of the radiation causes an increase in the flow of photoelectrons.
How does the electromagnetic wave theory explain the photoelectric
effect? It canÕt. According to electromagnetic wave theory, the electric field

accelerates and ejects the electrons from the metal, and the strength of the
electric field is related to the intensity of the radiation (not to the radia-
tionÕs frequency). Thus, it follows that electrons in the metal would need

to absorb energy from a dim light source for a very long time before they

gained enough energy to be ejected. As you just learned, however, this is

not the case. Observations show that electrons are ejected immediately

when even low-intensity radiation at or above the threshold frequency is

incident on the metal.Photons and quantized energyIn 1905, Albert Einstein published a 
revolutionary theory that explained the photoelectric effect. According 
to Einstein, light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation consist of
discrete, quantized bundles of energy, each of which was later called a

photon.The energy of a photon depends on its frequency.
In the above equation, 
fis frequency in Hz, and his PlanckÕs constant.
Because the unit Hz1/s or s1, the J/Hz unit of PlanckÕs constant is also
equivalent to J
s. Because the joule is too large a unit of energy to use with
atomic-sized systems, the more convenient energy unit of the electron volt

(eV) is usually used. One electron volt is the energy of an electron accelerated

across a potential difference of 1 V.
1 eV(1.601019C)(1 V)1.601019CV1.601019JUsing the definition of an electron volt allows the photon energy equa-
tion to be rewritten in a simplified form, as shown below.

It is important to note that EinsteinÕs theory of the photon goes further
than PlanckÕs theory of radiation from hot bodies. While Planck had 
proposed that vibrating atoms emit electromagnetic radiation with energy
equal to nhf, he did not suggest that light and other forms of electromagneticradiation act like particles. EinsteinÕs theory of the photon reinterpreted

and extended PlanckÕs theory of radiation from hot bodies.
EinsteinÕs photoelectric-effect theory is able to explain the existence of a
threshold frequency. A photon with a minimum frequency and energy, 
hf0,is needed to eject an electron from metal. If the photon has a frequency
below 
f0, the photon will not have the energy needed to eject an electron.
Because one photon interacts with one electron, an electron cannot simply
accumulate subthreshold energy photons until it has enough energy to be
ejected. On the other hand, radiation with a frequency greater than f0hasmore than enough energy to eject an electron. In fact, the excess energy, 

hfhf0, becomes the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.Kinetic Energy of an Electron Ejected Due to the Photoelectric EffectKEhfhf0The kinetic energy of an ejected electron is equal to the difference between
the incoming photon energy, 
hf, and the energy needed to free the electronfrom the metal, 
hf0.722-734 CH27-S1-845813  3/12/04  6:48 AM  Page 728Section 27.1A Particle Model of Waves

The maximum
kinetic energy of electrons ejected from the cathode can be

measured using this apparatus.
The ammeter measures the

current through the circuit. By
adjusting the potentiometer, the

experimenter can determine 

the potential that results in 

zero current. At the zero current
threshold, the maximum possible

kinetic energy of the ejectedelectron can be calculated.
Note that hf0is the minimum energy needed to free the most looselyheld electron in an atom. Because not all electrons in an atom have the

same energy, some will require more than this minimum energy in order

to escape. As a result, the ejected electrons have differing kinetic energies.

Thus, it is important to realize that the phrase Òkinetic energy of the ejected

electronsÓ refers to the maximum kinetic energy that an ejected electron
could have. Some of the ejected electrons will have less.
Testing the photoelectric theory
How can EinsteinÕs theory be tested? The
kinetic energy of the ejected electrons can be measured indirectly by a device
like the one illustrated in Figure 27-4.A variable electric potential difference
is used to adjust the voltage across the tube. When the potential difference is

adjusted to make the anode negative, the ejected electrons must expend

energy to reach the anode. 
Only electrons ejected from the cathode withsufficient kinetic energy will be able to reach the anode.
As shown in Figure 27-4, light of the chosen frequency illuminates the
cathode. Gradually, the experimenter increases the opposing potential dif-

ference, thereby making the anode more negative. As the opposing poten-

tial difference increases, more kinetic energy is needed for the electrons to

reach the anode, and fewer electrons arrive there to complete the circuit. At

a certain voltage, called the stopping potential, there are no electrons with

enough kinetic energy to reach the anode, and the current stops.
At the stopping potential, the kinetic energy of the electrons at the 
cathode equals the work done by the electric field to stop them. This is 

represented in equation form as KEqV0. In this equation, V0is themagnitude of the stopping potential in volts (J/C), and 
qis the charge ofthe electron (1.601019C). Note that the negative sign in the equation
along with the negative value of 
qyield a positive value for 
KE.ApplicationsThe photoelectric effect is used in a variety of everyday appli-
cations. Solar panels, shown in 
Figure 27-5,use the photoelectric effect toconvert the SunÕs light into electricity. Garage-door openers have safety beams

of infrared light that create current in the receiver through the photoelectric

effect. If the beam of light is interrupted by an object as the garage door is

closing, the current in the receiver stops and triggers the opener to open the

door. The photoelectric effect also is used in nightlights and photo eyes that

turn lights on and off automatically, depending on whether it is day or night.

733The Compton Effect
The photoelectric effect demonstrates that a photon, even though it has
no mass, has kinetic energy just as a particle does. In 1916, Einstein pre-
dicted that the photon should have another particle property: momentum.

He showed that the momentum of a photon should be equal to 
E/c.Because Ehfand f/c1/, the photonÕs momentum is given by the 
following equation. 
Experiments done by an American physicist, Arthur Holly Compton, in
1922 tested EinsteinÕs theory. The results of ComptonÕs experiments 

further supported the particle model of light. Compton directed X rays of

a known wavelength at a graphite target, as shown in 
Figure 27-7a,andmeasured the wavelengths of the X rays scattered by the target. He observed

that some of the X rays were scattered without change in 
wavelength,
whereas others had a longer wavelength than that of the original radiation.

These results are shown in 
Figure 27-7b.
Note that the peak wavelength
for the unscattered X rays corresponds to the wavelength of the original

incident X rays, whereas the peak wavelength for the scattered X rays is

greater than that of the original incident X rays.
Recall that the equation for the energy of a photon, 
Ehf, also can bewritten as Ehc/. This second equation shows that the energy of a pho-
ton is inversely proportional to its wavelength. The increase in wavelength

that Compton observed meant that the X-ray photons had lost both energy

and momentum. The shift in the energy of scattered photons is called the
Compton effect.This shift in energy is very small, only about 10
3nm,and is a measurable effect only when X rays having wavelengths of 10
2nmor less are used. Photon MomentumphcfhThe momentum of a photon is equal to PlanckÕs constant divided by the

Critical ThinkingImagine that the collision oftwo billiard balls models the interaction of a 
photon and an electron during the Compton effect.
Suppose the electron is replaced by a much more
massive proton. Would this proton gain as much

energy from the collision as the electron does?

Would the photon lose as much energy as it does

when it collides with the electron?
27.1Section Review
physicspp.com/self_check_quizIn later experiments, Compton observed that electrons were ejected
from the graphite block during the experiment. He suggested that the X-ray photons collided with electrons in the graphite target and transferred

energy and momentum to them. Compton thought that these photon-
electron collisions were similar to the elastic collisions experienced by 

billiard balls, as shown in 
Figure 27-8.He tested this idea by measuring
the energy of the ejected electrons. Compton found that the energy and

momentum gained by the electrons equaled the energy and momentum

lost by the photons. Thus, photons obey the laws of conservation of

momentum and energy when they are involved in collisions with other

particles.
bFigure 27-8
Much like thecollision between two billiard balls (a),when a photon strikes
an electron, the energy and

less electromagnetic wave has momentum and energy, like a particle.
If an electromagnetic wave has particlelike properties, could a particle

exhibit interference and diffraction, as a wave does? In other words, does a

particle have wavelike properties? In 1923, French physicist Louis de

Broglie proposed just this, that material particles have 
wave 
properties.
This proposal was so extraordinary that it was ignored by other scientists

until Einstein read de BroglieÕs papers and supported his ideas.
De Broglie Waves
Recall that the momentum of an object is equal to its mass times its
velocity, 
pmv. By analogy with the momentum of a photon, ph/, de Broglie proposed that the momentum of a particle is represented by the

following equation:
pmvhThe wavelength in the above relationship represents that of the moving
particle and is known as the 
de Broglie wavelength.
The following 
equation solves directly for the de Broglie wavelength. 
According to de Broglie, particles such as electrons and protons should
show wavelike properties. Effects such as diffraction and interference had

never been observed for particles, so de BroglieÕs work was greeted with

considerable doubt. In 1927, however, the results of two independent

experiments proved that electrons are diffracted just as light is. In one

experiment, English physicist George Thomson aimed a beam of electrons

at a very thin crystal. Atoms in crystals are arrayed in a regular pattern that

acts as a diffraction grating. Electrons diffracted from the crystal formed

the same patterns that X rays of a similar wavelength formed. 
Figure 27-9shows the pattern made by diffracting electrons. In the United States,

Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer performed a similar experiment using

electrons reflected and diffracted from thick crystals. The two experiments

proved that material particles have wave properties. 
The wave nature of objects you see and handle every day is not observ-
able because their wavelengths are extremely short. For example, consider

the de Broglie wavelength of a 0.145-kg baseball when it leaves a bat with

a speed of 38 m/s. 
= mhv= 1.21034mThis wavelength is far too small to have observable effects. As you will see

in the following Example Problem, however, an extremely small particle,

such as an electron, has a wavelength that can be observed and measured.

When an
electron collides with a massive particle, the elec-

possible to increase the wavelength of a photon?27.
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
When light
or a beam of atoms passes through a double slit,
an interference pattern forms. Both results occur

even when atoms or photons pass through the slits

one at a time. How does the Heisenberg uncer-

tainty principle explain this?
28.Critical ThinkingPhysicists recently made a dif-
fraction grating of standing waves of light. Atoms

passing through the grating produce an interfer-

ence pattern. If the spacing of the slits in the 

grating were 12(about 250 nm), what was the 
approximate de Broglie wavelength of the atoms?27.2Section Review
Particles and Waves
Is light a particle or a wave? Evidence suggests that both particle and
wave 
models are needed to explain the behavior of light. As you are about
to discover, quantum theory and the dual nature of electromagnetic radia-
tion led to fascinating scientific principles and applications. One such

application, the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), is discussed in the
How it Works feature on page 740.
Determining location and momentumIt is logical to think that to accu-rately define the properties of an object, you would need to devise an
experiment that directly measures the desired properties. For example, you

cannot simply state that a particle is at a certain location moving with a

specific speed. Rather, an experiment must be performed that locates the

particle and measures its speed.How can you detect the location of a particle? You must touch it or
reflect light from it. If light is used, then the reflected light must be 
collected by an instrument or the human eye. Because of diffraction effects,

the light used to detect the particle spreads out and makes it impossible to
locate the particle exactly. The use of shorter-wavelength light or radiation

decreases diffraction and allows the location of a particle to be more 

precisely measured.Heisenberg uncertainty principleAs a result of the Compton effect,however, when short-wavelength, high-energy radiation strikes a particle,
the particleÕs momentum is changed, as shown in 
Figure 27-10.
Therefore,
the act of precisely measuring the location of a particle has the effect of
changing the particleÕs momentum. The more precise the determination of

a particleÕs location, the greater the uncertainty is in its momentum. In the

same way, if the momentum of the particle is measured, the position of the

particle changes and becomes less certain. This situation is summarized by

the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
which states that it is impossibleto measure precisely both the position and momentum of a particle at the
same time. This principle, named for German physicist Werner Heisenberg,

is the result of the dual wave and particle properties of light and matter.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us there is a limit to how accu-

rately position and momentum can be measured.Momentum  0After CollisionBefore Collision

A particle can be
seen only when light is scattered
from it. Thus, the electron remains

undetected (a)until an incidentphoton strikes it 
(b).The collision
scatters the photon and electron
and changes their momenta.

object only when the frequency of the radiation is greater than a certain mini-
mum value, called the threshold frequency. In this investigation you will model

the photoelectric effect using steel balls. You will examine why only certain types

of electromagnetic radiation result in the emission of photoelectrons.

2The tip of an STM™s microscope probe is 
positioned extremely close to the sample 
(about 1 nm above the surface). As 
predicted by quantum physics, some 
electrons jump, or tunnel, between the 
surface of the sample and the tip of the 
probe. The moving electrons produce a 
current (measured in nanoamperes).3The control system scans the 
probe back and forth and up 
and down above the surface 
of the sample. The distance 
between the surface and the 
tip is kept constant, producing 
a constant current. The up-
and-down movement of the 
tip is recorded and turned 
into an image.1A voltage is applied 
to the sample to  
be viewed. The 
sample must be  
a conductor.
The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) was invented
in 1981 by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer. Five years

later, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. The

atomic-level resolution of an STM allows scientists to

form images of atoms, such as the image of silicon atoms

shown on the monitor below. How does an STM work?

Key Concepts
¥Objects that are hot enough to be incandescent emit light because of thevibrations of the charged particles inside their atoms.
¥The spectrum of incandescent objects covers a broad range of wavelengths.

The spectrum depends upon the temperature of the incandescent objects.
¥Planck explained the spectrum of an incandescent object by supposing that 

a particle can have only certain energies that are multiples of a constant, 

now called PlanckÕs constant.
¥Einstein explained the photoelectric effect by postulating that light exists in

bundles of energy called photons.
¥The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons by certain metals when

they are exposed to electromagnetic radiation.¥The photoelectric effect allows the measurement of PlanckÕs constant, 
h.¥The work function, which is equivalent to the binding energy of the electron,

is measured by the threshold frequency in the photoelectric effect.
¥The Compton effect demonstrates that photons have momentum, as

predicted by Einstein.
¥Even though photons, which travel at the speed of light, have zero mass, 

they do have energy and momentum.

¥The wave nature of material particles was suggested by de Broglie and

verified experimentally by the diffraction of electrons through crystals. All

moving particles have a wavelength, known as the de Broglie wavelength.
¥The particle and wave aspects are complementary parts of the complete

nature of both matter and light.¥The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is not possible to
simultaneously measure the precise position and momentum of any 

particle of light or matter.

principal quantum numberBy the end of the nineteenth century, most scientists agreed on the

existence of atoms. J. J. ThomsonÕs discovery of the electron provided
convincing evidence that the atom was made up of even smaller, sub-

atomic particles. Every atom tested by Thomson contained negatively

charged electrons, and these electrons possessed very little mass. Because

atoms were known to be much more massive than the mass accounted for

by the electrons they contain, scientists began looking for the missing mass

that must be part of each atom. What was the nature of this yet-to-be-

discovered massive part of the atom? How was this mass distributed within

the atom?Moreover, atoms were known to be electrically neutral, yet, only nega-
tively charged electrons had been identified within the atom. How were

the negatively charged electrons arranged in the atom? What was the

source of the atomÕs neutrality? Were positively charged particles also 

present in the atom? Knowing that their understanding of the atom was 

far from complete, scientists began searching for answers to numerous and

challenging questions.

After bombardingmetal foil with alpha particles,
RutherfordÕs team concluded that

most of the mass of the atom was
concentrated in the nucleus.The Nuclear ModelMany questions faced the researchers investigating the nature of the
atom. What caused the emission of light from atoms? How were the 

electrons distributed in the atom? Physicists and chemists from many

countries searched for the solutions to this puzzle. The results not only

provided knowledge about the structure of the atom, but also a totally new

approach to both physics and chemistry. The history of the research into

the nature of the atom is one of the most exciting stories of the twentieth

century. 
J. J. Thomson believed that a massive, positively charged substance filled
the atom. He pictured the negatively charged electrons as being distributed

throughout this positively charged substance like raisins in a muffin.

Ernest Rutherford, along with laboratory collaborators Hans Geiger and

Ernest Marsden, however, performed a series of experiments that showed

the atom had a very different structure.
RutherfordÕs experiments made use of radioactive compounds that
emitted penetrating rays. Some of these emissions had been found to be

massive, positively charged particles that moved at high speeds. These 

particles, which were later named 
alpha particles,
are represented by the
symbol 
. The -particles in RutherfordÕs experiments could be detected by
the small flashes of light that were emitted when the particles collided with

a zinc-sulfide-coated screen.As shown in 
Figure 28-1,Rutherford directed a beam of 
-particles atan extremely thin sheet of gold foil. Rutherford was aware of ThomsonÕs

model of the atom, and he expected only minor deflections of the -parti-cles as they passed through the thin gold foil. He thought that the paths of
the massive, high-speed 
-particles would be only slightly altered as they
passed through the evenly distributed positive charge making up each gold

atom. The test results amazed him. While most of the -particles passedthrough the gold foil either undeflected or only slightly deflected, a few of
the particles were scattered through very large angles. Some were even

deflected through angles larger than 90
°. A diagram of these results isshown in 
Figure 28-2.Rutherford compared his amazement to that of 
firing a 15-inch cannon shell at tissue paper and then having the shell

bounce back and hit him.746-759 CH28-S1-845813  6/8/04  6:59 PM  Page 748Section 28.1The Bohr Model of the Atom

When high voltage
is applied to a gas, the gas emits
light, producing a unique glow.
Hydrogen gas glows magenta 
(a),mercury glows bright blue (b), andnitrogen glows rose-orange (c).Using CoulombÕs force law and NewtonÕs laws of motion, Rutherford
concluded that the results could be explained only if all of the atomÕs pos-
itive charge were concentrated in a tiny, massive central core, now called

the nucleus.
Therefore, RutherfordÕs model of the atom is called the
nuclear model. Researchers have since determined that all the positive

charge and more than 99.9 percent of the mass of the atom are containedin its nucleus. The 
electrons, which do not contribute a significant amount
of mass to the atom, are distributed outside of and far away 
from thenucleus. Thus, the 
space occupied by the electrons defines the overall 
size, or diameter, of the atom. Because the diameter of the atom is about

10,000 times larger than the diameter of the nucleus, the atom mostly is

made up of empty space.
Emission spectra
How are the electrons arranged around the nucleus of
the atom? One of the clues that scientists used to answer this question
came from the study of the light emitted by atoms. Recall from the previ-

ous chapter that the set of electromagnetic wavelengths emitted by an

atom is called the atomÕs emission spectrum.
As shown in 
Figure 28-3,atoms of a gaseous sample can be made toemit light in a gas-discharge tube. You probably are familiar with the 

colorful neon signs used by some businesses. These signs work on the

same principles as gas-discharge tubes do. A gas-discharge tube consists of
a low-pressure gas contained within a glass tube that has metal electrodes

attached to each end. The gas glows when high voltage is applied across 

the tube. What interested scientists the most about this phenomenon was

the fact that each different gas glowed with a different, unique color. The

characteristic glows emitted by several gases are shown in Figure 28-3.

Highvoltage Gas-discharge tubecontaining gasPrismBright linesxyAligning slitsDetectorWhen the light emitted by the gas is passed through a prism or a diffrac-
tion grating, the emission spectrum of an atom is obtained. An emissionspectrum can be studied in greater detail using an instrument called a spec-
troscope. As shown in 
Figure 28-4a,light in a prism spectroscope passesthrough a slit and is then dispersed as it travels through a prism. A lens 

system (not shown in the diagram) focuses the dispersed light so that it

can be viewed, or recorded on a photographic plate or an electronic detec-

tor. The spectroscope forms an image of the slit at a different position for

each wavelength.
The spectrum of a hot body, or incandescent solid, such as the filament
in a lightbulb, is a continuous band of colors from red through violet. The

spectrum of a gas, however, is a series of distinct lines of different colors.

The bright-line emission spectra for mercury gas and barium gas are shown

in Figure 28-4band Figure 28-4c,respectively. Each colored line corre-
sponds to a particular wavelength of light emitted by the atoms of that gas.
An emission spectrum is also a useful analytic tool, as it can be used toidentify an unknown sample of gas. When the unknown gas is placed in a

gas-discharge tube, it can be made to emit light. The emitted light consists

of wavelengths that are uniquely characteristic of the atoms of that gas.

Thus, the unknown gas can be identified by comparing its wavelengths

with the wavelengths present in the spectra of known samples.
An emission spectrum also can be used to analyze a mixture of gases.
When the emission spectrum of a combination of elements is pho-
tographed, an analysis of the lines on the photograph can indicate the

identities and the relative concentrations of the elements present. If the

material being examined contains a large amount of any particular element,

the lines for that element are more intense on the photograph than those
of the other elements of lesser quantities. Through a comparison of the line

intensities, the percentage composition of the material can be determined.

In 1814, Josef von Fraunhofer observed the presence
of several dark lines in the spectrum of sunlight. These dark lines, now

called Fraunhofer lines, are seen in 
Figure 28-5.He reasoned that as sun-light passed through the gaseous atmosphere surrounding the Sun, the
gases absorbed certain characteristic wavelengths. These absorbed wave-

lengths produced the dark lines in the observed spectrum. The set of 

wavelengths absorbed by a gas is the 
absorption spectrum of the gas. The
composition of the SunÕs atmosphere was determined by comparing the

missing lines in the observed spectrum with the known emission spectra

of various elements. The 
compositions of many other stars have been deter-
mined using this technique. 
You can observe an absorption spectrum by passing white light through
a gas sample and a spectroscope, as shown in 
Figure 28-6a.Because thegas absorbs specific wavelengths, the normally continuous spectrum of 

the white light has dark lines in it after passing through the gas. For a gas, the

bright lines of the emission spectrum and the dark lines of the absorption
spectrum often occur at the same wavelengths, as shown in 
Figure 28-6band Figure 28-6c,respectively. Thus, cool, gaseous elements absorb the
same wavelengths that they emit when excited. As you might expect, the

composition of a gas can be determined from the wavelengths of the dark

lines of the gasÕs absorption spectrum.

Spectroscopy
Both emission and absorption spectra are valuable scien-
tific tools. As a result of the elementsÕ characteristic spectra, scientists are

able to analyze, identify, and quantify unknown materials by observing the

spectra that they emit or absorb. The emission and absorption spectra of

elements are important in industry as well as in scientific research. For

example, steel mills reprocess large quantities of scrap iron of varying 

compositions. The exact composition of a sample of scrap iron can be

determined in minutes by spectrographic analysis. The composition of the

steel can then be adjusted to suit commercial specifications. Aluminum,

zinc, and other metal-processing plants employ the same method.
The study of spectra is a branch of science known as spectroscopy.
Spectroscopists are employed throughout research and industrial commu-

nities. Spectroscopy has proven to be an effective tool for analyzing mate-

rials on Earth, and it is the only currently available tool for studying the

composition of stars over the vast expanse of space. 
The Bohr Model of the Atom
In the nineteenth century, many physicists tried to use atomic spectra to
determine the structure of the atom. Hydrogen was studied extensively

because it is the lightest element and has the simplest spectrum. The 
visible spectrum of hydrogen consists of four lines: red, green, blue, and

violet, as shown in 
Figure 28-7.Any theory that explained the structure 
of the atom would have to account for these wavelengths and support 

the nuclear model. However, the nuclear model as proposed by Rutherford

was not without its problems. Rutherford had suggested that electrons

orbit the nucleus much like the planets orbit the Sun. There was, however,

a serious flaw in this planetary model.
Problems with the planetary model
An electron in an orbit constantly isaccelerated toward the nucleus. As you learned in Chapter 26, accelerating
electrons radiate energy by emitting electromagnetic waves. At the rate that an

orbiting electron would lose energy, it should spiral into the nucleus within

109s. This, however, must
 not be happening because atoms are known to
be stable. Thus, the planetary model was not consistent with the laws of elec-

tromagnetism. In addition, the planetary model predicted that the accelerat-
ing electrons would radiate 
energy at all wavelengths. However, as you just
learned, the light emitted by atoms is radiated only at specific wavelengths.
Danish physicist Niels Bohr went to England in 1911 and joined
RutherfordÕs group to work on determining the structure of the atom. He

tried to unite the nuclear model with PlanckÕs quantized energy levels and

EinsteinÕs theory of light. This was a courageous idea because as of 1911,

neither of these revolutionary ideas was widely understood or accepted.
746-759 CH28-S1-845813  3/22/04  6:23 AM  Page 752Quantized Energy
Bohr began with the planetary arrangement of electrons, as diagrammed
in Figure 28-8,but then made the bold hypothesis that the laws of elec-
tromagnetism do not apply inside the atom. He postulated that an elec-tron in a stable orbit does not radiate energy, even though it is accelerating.

Bohr referred to this stable condition as a stationary state. He went on to

assume that only stationary states with specific amounts of energy are
allowed. In other words, Bohr considered the energy levels in an atom to

be quantized.As shown in 
Figure 28-9,the quantization of energy in atoms can belikened to a flight of stairs with decreasing-height steps. To go up the stairs

you must move from one step to the nextÑit is impossible to stop at a

midpoint between steps. Instead of steps, atoms have quantized amounts

of energy, each of which is called an 
energy level.
Just as you cannot
occupy a position between steps, an atomÕs energy cannot have a value

between allowed energy levels. An atom with the smallest allowable

amount of energy is said to be in the ground state.
When an atomabsorbs energy, it moves, or makes a transition to, a higher energy level.

Any energy level above the ground state is called an 
excited state.
Energy of an AtomWhat determines the amount of energy an atom has?An atomÕs energy equals the sum of the kinetic energy of the electrons and

the potential energy from the attractive force between the electrons and the

nucleus. The energy of an atom with electrons in a nearby orbit is less than

that of an atom with electrons in a faraway orbit because work must be

done to move the electrons away from the nucleus. Thus, atoms in excited,

higher-energy states have electrons in larger, or more distant, orbits.

Because energy is quantized and energy is related to the size of the orbit,
the size of the orbit also is quantized. The model of an atom just described,
that of a central nucleus with orbiting electrons having specific quantized

energy levels, is known as the Bohr model of the atom.
If Bohr was correct in hypothesizing that stable atoms do not radiate
energy, then what is responsible for an atomÕs characteristic emission spec-

trum? To answer this question, Bohr suggested that electromagnetic energy

is emitted when the atom changes from one stationary state to another.

Incorporating EinsteinÕs photoelectric theory, Bohr knew that the energy of

every photon is given by the equation, 
Ephotonhf. He then postulatedthat when an atom absorbs a photon, the atomÕs energy increases by an

amount equal to that of the photon. This excited atom then makes a tran-
sition to a lower energy level by emitting a photon.

Figure 28-10,
the change in energy of the atom equals theenergy of the emitted photon. EphotonEatomorEphotonEfEiThe following equations summarize the relationships between the
change in energy states of an atom and the energy of the photon emitted.Predictions of the Bohr Model
A scientific theory must do more than present postulates; it must allow predictions to be made that can be checked against experimental
data. A good theory also can be applied to many different problems, and

it ultimately provides a simple, unified explanation of some part of the

physical world. 
Bohr used his theory to calculate the wavelengths of light emitted by a
hydrogen atom. The calculations were in excellent agreement with the val-

ues measured by other scientists. As a result, BohrÕs model was widely

accepted. Unfortunately, the model only worked for the element hydrogen;

it could not predict the spectrum of helium, the next-simplest element. In
addition, there was not a good explanation as to why the laws of electro-

magnetism should work everywhere but inside the atom. Not even Bohr

believed that his model was a complete theory of the structure of the atom.

Despite its shortcomings, however, the Bohr model describes the energy

levels and wavelengths of light emitted and absorbed by hydrogen atoms

remarkably well.
Development of BohrÕs model
Bohr developed his model by applying
NewtonÕs second law of motion, 
Fnetma, to the electron. The net forceis described by CoulombÕs law for the interaction between an electron of
charge qthat is a distance rfrom a proton of charge q. That force isgiven by 
FKq2/r2. The acceleration of the electron in a circular orbitabout a much more massive proton is given by 
av2/r, where the negative sign shows that the direction is inward. Thus, Bohr obtained the

following relationship:
Krq22mrv2In the equation, Kis the constant from CoulombÕs law and has a value of
9.0109Nm2/C2.Energy of an Emitted PhotonEphotonhf,  or  EphotonEatomThe energy of an emitted photon is equal to the product of PlanckÕs constant
and the emitted photonÕs frequency. The energy of an emitted photon also is

equal to the loss in the atomÕs energy.

the initial and final energy levelsof the atom. 746-759 CH28-S1-845813  6/8/04  7:02 PM  Page 754Next, Bohr considered the angular momentum of the orbiting electron,which is equal to the product of an electronÕs momentum and the radius
of its circular orbit. The angular momentum of the electron is thus given

by 
mvr
. Bohr postulated that angular momentum also is quantized; that is,
the angular momentum of an electron can have only certain values. He

claimed that the allowed values were multiples of 
h/2, where his PlanckÕs
constant. Using nto represent an integer, Bohr proposed that 
mvrnh/2.Using Kq2/r2mv2/rand rearranging the angular momentum equation, vnh/2mr, Bohr found that the orbital radii of the electrons in a hydro-
gen atom are given by the following equation. 
You can calculate the radius of the innermost orbit of a hydrogen atom,
also known as the Bohr radius, by substituting known values and 
n1into the above equation.
r15.31011J2s2/Nm2kg5.31011m, or 0.053 nm
By performing a little more algebra you can show that the total energy
of the atom, which is the sum of the kinetic energy of the electron and the 
potential energy, and is given by 
Kq2/2r, is represented by the following
equation: En2hK22mq4n12By substituting numerical values for the constants, you can calculate the

total energy of the atom in joules, which yields the following equation:
En2.171018Jn12Converting the relationship to units of electron volts yields the following

equation.Both the electronÕs orbital radius and the energy of the atom are quan-
tized. The integer, 
n, that appears in these equations is called the principalquantum number.
It is the principal quantum number that determinesthe quantized values of 
rand E. In summary, the radius, 
r, increases as thesquare of n, whereas the energy, 
E, depends on 1/n2.Energy of a Hydrogen Atom

The distinct set of color lines that make up a hydrogen atomÕs visible
spectrum are known as the Balmer series. This visible light is the result of the photons
emitted when electrons make transitions to the second energy level, n2. Otherelectron transitions in a hydrogen atom result in the emission of ultraviolet (Lyman

series) and infrared (Paschen series) electromagnetic energy.
Energy and electron transitions
You may be wondering why the energy
of an atom in the Bohr model has a negative value. Recall from Chapter 11

that only energy differences have meaning. The zero energy level can be

chosen at will. In this case, zero energy is defined as the energy of the atom

when the electron is infinitely far from the nucleus and has no kinetic
energy. This condition exists when the atom has been ionized; that is,

when the electron has been removed from the atom. Because work has to

be done to ionize an atom, the energy of an atom with an orbiting 
electron is less than zero. The energy of an atom has a negative value.

When an atom makes a transition from a lower to a higher energy level, the

total energy becomes less negative, but the overall energy change is positive.
Some of hydrogenÕs energy levels and the possible energy level transi-
tions that it can undergo are shown in 
Figure 28-11.
Note that an excitedhydrogen atom can emit electromagnetic energy in the infrared, visible, or

ultraviolet range depending on the transition that occurs. Ultraviolet light

is emitted when the atom drops into its ground state from any excited state.

The four visible lines in the hydrogen spectrum are produced when the atom

drops from the n3 or higher energy state into the n2 energy state.

28.1Section Review
Although the Bohr atomic model accurately explained the behavior of ahydrogen atom, it was unable to explain the behavior of any other atom.
Verify the limitations of the Bohr model by analyzing an electron transition

in a neon atom. Unlike a hydrogen atom, a neon atom has ten electrons.
One of these electrons makes a transition between the 
n5 and the n3 energy states, emitting a photon in the process.
1.Assuming that the neon atomÕs electron can be treated as an electron in a
hydrogen atom, what photon energy does the Bohr model predict?
2.Assuming that the neon atomÕs electron can be treated as an electron in a

hydrogen atom, what photon wavelength does the Bohr model predict?
3.The actual wavelength of the photon emitted during the transition is 632.8 nm.

What is the percent error of the Bohr modelÕs prediction of photon wavelength?

Honored in these
postage stamps from Denmark
and Sweden, Niels BohrÕs great

contribution to our understanding

of the atom earned him worldwide
recognition and a Nobel prize.The Bohr model was a major contribution to scientistsÕ understanding
of the structure of the atom. In addition to calculating the emission spec-trum, Bohr and his students were able to calculate the ionization energy of

a hydrogen atom. The ionization energy of an atom is the energy needed

to completely free an electron from an atom. The calculated ionization
value closely agreed with experimental data. The Bohr model further pro-

vided an explanation of some of the chemical properties of the elements.

The idea that atoms have electron arrangements unique to each element is

the foundation of much of our knowledge of chemical reactions and

bonding. Niels Bohr, whose accomplishments are commemorated in the

stamps shown in 
Figure 28-12,was awarded a Nobel prize in 1922.

For an electron 
to have a stable orbit around the
nucleus, the circumference of the
orbit must be a whole-number
multiple, n, of the de Brogliewavelength. Note that the whole-
number multiples 
n3 and n5are stable, whereas 
n2.9 is not.The postulates that Bohr made could not be explained on the basis of
accepted physics principles of the time. For example, electromagnetic
theory required that the accelerated particles radiate energy, causing the

rapid collapse of the atom. In addition, the idea that electron orbits have

well-defined radii was in conflict with the Heisenberg uncertainty princi-

ple. How could BohrÕs work be put on a firm foundation?
From Orbits to an Electron Cloud
The first hint to the solution of these problems was provided by Louis
de Broglie. Recall from Chapter 27 that de Broglie proposed that particles

have wave properties, just as light has particle properties. The de Broglie

wavelength of a particle with momentum 
mvis defined as h/mv. Theangular momentum of a particle can be defined as mvr
hr/. Thus,
BohrÕs required quantized angular-momentum condition, 
mvr
nh/2,can be written in the following way:
hr2nhorn2rThat is, the circumference of the Bohr orbit, 2
r, is equal to a whole num-ber multiple, 
n, of de Broglie wavelengths, 
. Figure 28-13illustrates thisrelationship.In 1926, Austrian physicist Erwin Schrıedinger used de BroglieÕs wave
model to create a quantum theory of the atom based on waves. This theory

did not propose a simple planetary model of an atom, as BohrÕs model

had. In particular, the radius of the electron orbit was not likened to the

radius of the orbit of a planet about the Sun.The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to know
both the position and momentum of an electron at the same time. Thus,

the modern quantum modelof the atom predicts only the probabilitythat an electron is in a specific region. Interestingly, the quantum model

predicts that the most probable distance between the electron and the

nucleus for a hydrogen atom is the same as the radius predicted by the

Bohr model.760-765 CH28-S2-845813  3/22/04  6:47 AM  Page 760Section 28.2The Quantum Model of the Atom

Waves of
incoherent light (a)and coherentlight (b)are shown.abThe probability of the electron being at any specific radius can be cal-
culated, and a three-dimensional plot can be constructed showing regions
of equal probability. The region in which there is a high probability of

finding the electron is called the electron cloud.A slice through the elec-tron cloud for the two lowest energy states of a hydrogen atom is shown in
Figure 28-14.Even though the quantum model of the atom is difficult to visualize,
quantum mechanics,
the study of the properties of matter using its wave
properties, makes use of this model and has been extremely successful in

predicting many details of atomic structure. These details are very difficult

to calculate precisely for all but the simplest atoms. Only very sophisti-

cated computers can make highly accurate approximations for the heavier

atoms. Quantum mechanics also enables the structures of many molecules

to be calculated, allowing chemists to determine the arrangement of atoms

in the molecules. Guided by quantum mechanics, chemists have been able

to create new and useful molecules that do not occur in nature. Quantum

mechanics also is used to analyze the details of the emission and absorp-
tion of light by atoms. As a result of quantum mechanical theory, a new

source of light was developed. 
Lasers
As you know, light emitted by an incandescent source has a continuum
of wavelengths, whereas light produced by an atomic gas consists of only

a few distinct wavelengths. Light from both sources travels in all directions.

Furthermore, light waves emitted by atoms at one end of a gas-discharge

tube are not necessarily in step, or synchronized, with waves from the

other end of the tube. That is, the waves are not necessarily all at the same

point in their cycle at the same time. Recall from Chapter 19 that waves

that are in step, with their minima and maxima coinciding, are said to be
coherent. Light waves that are coherent are referred to as 
coherent light.Out-of-step light waves produce 
incoherent light.Both types of lightwaves are shown in 
Figure 28-15.Light is emitted by atoms that have been excited. So far, you have
learned about two ways in which atoms can be excited: thermal excitation

and electron collision. Atoms also can be excited by collisions with pho-

tons of exactly the right energy.

These plots show

10 Bohr radii from the nucleus for

During spontan-
eous emission, an electron in anatom drops from the excited state,

E2, to the ground state, 
E1, byspontaneously emitting a photon

with energy, 
hf(a).Duringstimulated emission, an excited
atom is struck by a photon with
energy E2E1. The 
atom drops tothe ground state and emits a

photon. Both the incident andemitted photon have the same
energy: EphotonE2E1(b).abSpontaneous and stimulated emissionWhat happens when an atom isin an excited state? After a very short time, it normally returns to the
ground state, giving off a photon of the same energy that it absorbed, as

shown in 
Figure 28-16a.This process is called spontaneous emission.In 1917, Einstein considered what happens to an atom already in an
excited state that is struck by a photon with an energy equal to the energy

difference between the excited state and the ground state. He showed that

the atom, by a process known as 
stimulated emission,returns to theground state and emits a photon with an energy equal to the energy 
difference between the two states. The photon that caused, or stimulated, 

the emission is not affected. The two photons leaving the atom not only

will have the same frequency, but 
they will be in step, or coherent, asshown in 
Figure 28-16b.
Either of the two photons can now strike other
excited atoms, thereby producing additional photons that are in step with

the original photons. This process can continue and produce an avalanche

of photons, all of the same wavelength and all having their maxima and

minima at the same times.
For this process to occur, certain conditions must be met. First, there
must be other atoms in the excited state. Second, the atoms must remain

in the excited state long enough to be struck by a photon. Third, the pho-

tons must be contained so that they are able to strike other excited atoms.

In 1959, a device called a laserwas invented that fulfilled all the condi-
tions needed to produce coherent light. The word 
laseris an acronym that
stands for light amplification by 
stimulated emission of radiation. An atomthat emits light when it is stimulated in a laser is said to lase.
Atom excitationThe atoms in a laser can be excited, or pumped, as out-lined in Figure 28-17.An intense flash of light with a wavelength shorter
than that of the laser can be used to pump the atoms. The shorter wave-
length, higher energy photons produced by the flash collide with and

excite the lasing atoms. When one of the excited atoms decays to a lower

energy state by emitting a photon, the avalanche of photons begins. This

results in the emission of a brief flash, or pulse, of laser light. Alternatively,

the lasing atoms can be excited by collisions with other atoms. In the

helium-neon lasers often seen in science classrooms, an electric discharge

excites the helium atoms. These excited helium atoms collide with the

neon atoms, pumping them to an excited state and causing them to lase.

The laser light resulting from this process is continuous rather than pulsed.760-765 CH28-S2-845813  3/22/04  6:48 AM  Page 762Section 28.2The Quantum Model of the Atom
763Figure 28-18
This argon laser
produces a beam of coherent light.
LasingThe photons emitted by the lasing atoms are 
contained by confining the lasing atoms within a glass
tube that has parallel mirrors at each end. One of the 
mirrors is more than 99.9% reflective and reflects nearly

all of the light hitting it, whereas the other mirror is par-
tially reflective and allows only about 1 percent of the

light hitting it to pass through. Photons that are emitted
in the direction of the ends of the tube will be reflected
back into the gas by the mirrors. The reflected photons

strike more atoms, releasing more photons with each pass

between the mirrors. As the process continues, a high

intensity of photons builds. The photons that exit 

the tube through the partially reflecting mirror produce
the laser beam. Figure 28-18shows a laser being used in
a laboratory.
Because all the stimulated photons are emitted in step with the photons that struck the atoms, laser light is

coherent light. The light is also all of one wavelength, or

monochromatic, because the transition of electrons
between only one pair of energy levels in one type of

atom is involved. The parallel mirrors used in the laser

result in the emitted laser light being highly directional.
In other words, laser light does not diverge much as it

travels. Because a typical laser beam is very small, often only about 2 mm

in diameter, the light is very intense. Many solid, liquid, and gas 

substances can be made to lase. Most substances produce laser light at 

only one wavelength. The light from some lasers, however, can be tuned,

or adjusted, over a range of wavelengths.

Laser Eye Surgery
Excimerlasers are used in laser eye surgerybecause the energy of the photons

that they emit are able to destroy

abnormal tissue without causing

harm to surrounding healthy
tissue. Thus, a skilled surgeon can

use the laser to remove extremely
thin layers of tissue in order to
reshape a cornea.

Laser Applications
If you have used a CD or a DVD player, then you have used a laser. These
lasers, as well as the ones used in laser pointers, are made of semiconduct-

ing solids. The laser in a CD player is made of layers of gallium arsenide

(GaAs) and gallium aluminum and arsenide (GaAlAs). The lasing layer is

only 200-nm thick, and each side of the crystal is only 1Ð2 mm long. The

atoms in the semiconducting solid are pumped by an electric current, and

the resulting photons are amplified as they bounce between the polished

ends of the crystal. 
Table 28-1
shows the wavelength and type, pulsed or
continuous, produced by some common lasers.
Most lasers are very inefficient. For example, no more than 1 percent of
the electrical energy delivered to a gas laser is converted to light energy.

Although crystal lasers have efficiencies near 20 percent, they often have

much less power than gas lasers do. Despite their inefficiency, the unique

properties of laser light have led to many applications. Laser beams are

narrow and highly directionalÑthey do not spread out over long 

distances. For this reason, surveyors use laser beams in applications 

such as checking the straightness of long tunnels and pipes. When astro-

nauts visited the Moon, they left behind mirrors on the MoonÕs surface.

Scientists on Earth have used the mirrors to reflect a laser beam transmitted

from Earth. The distance between Earth and the Moon was thus accurately

determined. By tracking the MoonÕs location from different parts of Earth,

the movement of EarthÕs tectonic plates has been measured.
Laser light also is commonly used in fiber-optics communications. A
fiber optic cable makes use of total internal reflection to transmit light over 

distances of many kilometers with little loss of signal energy. The laser, 

typically with a wavelength of 1300Ð1500 nm, is rapidly switched on and

off, transmitting information as a series of pulses through the fiber. All

over the world, optical fibers have replaced copper wires for the transmis-

sion of telephone calls, computer data, and even television pictures.

The ultraviolet
photons emitted by this laser areable to strip electrons from atoms
of the targeted tissue. The

photons break chemical bonds
and vaporize the tissue.The single wavelength of light emitted by lasers makes them valuable in
spectroscopy. Laser light is used to excite other atoms. The atoms then

return to the ground state and emit characteristic spectra. Samples with
extremely small numbers of atoms can be analyzed in this way. In fact, 

single atoms have been detected and held almost motionless by means of

laser excitation.The concentrated power of laser light is used in a variety of w
ays. In
medicine, for example, lasers are used to reshape the corneas of eyes.

Lasers also can be used in surgery, as shown in 
Figure 28-19,in place ofa knife to cut flesh with little loss of blood. In industry, lasers are used to

cut materials such as steel and to weld materials together. In the future,

lasers may be able to produce nuclear fusion to create an almost inex-

haustible energy source.

atom laser is a technology with a promising future. Unlike
traditional lasers that emit beams or pulses of
coherent photons, atom lasers emit beams or

pulses of coherent atoms. As explained below,

coherent atoms are different from the incoher-
ent atoms that make up ordinary matter.
HistoryIn 1923, LouisVictor de Broglie predicted
that all particles, including

atoms, have w
ave proper
ties.
Wavelength is inversely

related to the particleÕs mass

and velocity, and it is too

small to be observed at room

temperature. As the atom is

cooled, its speed is reduced
and its wavelength increases.
In the 1920s, Albert
Einstein and Satyendra Nath
Bose researched particles
known as bosons. They 

predicted that if bosons
could be cooled to their 
lowest possible energy state,

then all of the particles
would have the same phase

and the same wavelength. 

In other words, the particles

would have coherent proper-

ties. This unusual phase of

matter is called a Bose-
Einstein condensate.
The first Bose-Einstein condensates were formed in
1995 by Eric Cornell and

Carl Wieman, and independently, by Wolfgang

Ketterle. In further research, Ketterle brought two

separate Bose-Einstein condensate samples near
each other. Ketterle observed wavelike interfer-

ence patterns from the atoms in the condensates.

He went on to prove that all of the atoms in the

condensate had the same wavelength and were

in phase. The atoms in the condensate were

coherent, just as Bose and Einstein predicted.The First Atom Laser
In 1997, Ketterle
and his collaborators announced the first stepsin the development of an atom laser. They
developed a way to eject small pulses (between

100,000 and 1,000,000 atoms) of coherent

atoms from a Bose-Einstein condensate into 
a beam. In this first atom laser, pulses of coherent
atoms could only travel in a single direction.

The emitted atoms behaved like projectiles, 
following downward arcing

paths due to the influence 
of gravity. As shown in the

photo, the coherent atoms
in each pulse tend to spread
apart as the beam propagates.

In 1999, William Phillips
found a way to send pulses

of coherent atoms in any

direction and how to prevent

the atoms from spreading
out as the beam propagated.
By making a series of very

short pulses, Phillips was

able to form a continuous
beam of coherent atoms.
The Future
Bose-Einsteincondensates and atom lasers
will be used to study the
basic properties of quantum
mechanics and matter waves.

Scientists anticipate that
atom lasers will be useful in
making more-precise atomic
clocks and in building small
electronic circuits. The atom

laser also may be used in

atomic interferometry to pre-
cisely measure gravitational
forces and to test relativity.

Going Further
An atom laser emits pulses of coherent
sodium atoms. Each pulse contains 
105to 10
6atoms, and the pulses are
accelerated downward due to gravity.

The spreading of the pulses is a result

of repulsive forces.

Key Concepts
¥Ernest Rutherford directed positively charged, high-speed alpha particles at
thin metal foils. By studying the paths of the reflected particles, he showed

that an atom is mostly empty space with a tiny, massive, positively charged

nucleus at its center.
¥The spectrum produced by atoms of an element can be used to identify an

unknown sample of that element.
¥If white light passes through a gas, the gas absorbs the same wavelengths 

that it would emit if it were excited. If the light is then passed through a

prism, the absorption spectrum of the gas is visible.
¥Niels BohrÕs model of the atom correctly showed that the energy of an atom

can have only certain values; thus, it is quantized. He showed that the energy

of a hydrogen atom in energy level 
nis equal to the product of 13.6 eV and the inverse of 
n2.¥According to the Bohr model, atoms make transitions between allowable

energy levels, absorbing or emitting energy in the form of photons

(electromagnetic waves). The energy of the photon is equal to the difference

between the initial and final states of the atom.
¥According to the Bohr model, the radius of an electronÕs orbit can have only

certain (quantized) values. The radius of the electron in energy level 
nof ahydrogen atom is given by the following equation.
rn4h22Knm2q2EphotonEfEiEn13.6 eVn12Key Concepts
¥In the quantum-mechanical model of the atom, the atomÕs energy has only

specific, quantized values.
¥In the quantum-mechanical model of the atom, only the probability of
finding the electron in a specific region can be determined. In the hydrogen

atom, the most probable distance of the electron from the nucleus is the
same as the electronÕs orbital radius in the Bohr model.
¥Quantum mechanics is extremely successful in calculating the properties of
atoms, molecules, and solids.
¥Lasers produce light that is directional, powerful, monochromatic, and

coherent. Each property gives the laser useful applications.

semiconductorsband theory
intrinsic semiconductors

extrinsic semiconductorsElectronic devices depend not only on natural conductors and insula-
tors, but also on materials that have been designed and produced by
scientists and engineers working together. This brief investigation into 

electronics begins with a study of how materials conduct electricity.
All electronic devices owe their origins to the vacuum tubes of the early
1900s. In vacuum tubes, electron beams flow through space to amplify

and control faint electric signals. Vacuum tubes are big, require lots of 

electric power, and generate considerable heat. They have heated filaments,

which require the replacement of the tubes after one to five years.
In the late 1940s, solid-state devices were invented that could do 
the jobs of vacuum tubes. These devices are made of materials, such as 

silicon and germanium, known as 
semiconductors.
The devices amplifyand control very weak electric signals through the movement of  electrons

within a tiny crystalline space. Because very few electrons flow in them and

they have no filaments, devices made from semiconductors operate with 

a low power input. They are very small, donÕt generate much heat, and are

inexpensive to manufacture. The estimated useful life of these devices is 

20 years or more.
Section 29.1Conduction in Solids
775Horizons Companies774-783 CH29-S1-845813  6/8/04  7:26 PM  Page 775Band Theory of Solids
You have learned about electric conductors and insulators. In conduc-
tors, electric charges can move easily, but not in insulators. When you
examine these two types of materials at the atomic level, the difference in

the way they are able to carry charges becomes apparent.
You learned in Chapter 13 that crystalline solids consist of atoms bound
together in regular arrangements. You also know from Chapters 27 and 28

that an atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by

a cloud of negatively charged electrons. These electrons can occupy only

certain allowed energy levels. Under most conditions, the electrons in an

atom occupy the lowest possible energy levels. This condition is referred to

as the ground state. Because the electrons can have only certain energies,

any energy changes that occur are quantized; that is, the energy changes

occur in specific amounts.
Energy bandsSuppose you could construct a solid by assembling atoms
together, one by one. You would start with an atom in the ground state. At
large interatomic spacings (0.8 nm) with no very near neighbors, the
graph in Figure 29-1shows two discrete energy levels for the atom. As the
solid crystal forms by moving atoms closer to the atom, the electric fields

of these other neighboring atoms affect the energy levels of its electrons. In

the solid crystal, the result is that the ground state energy levels in each

atom are split into multiple levels by the electric fields of all of its neigh-

bors. There are so many of these levels, and they are so close together, that

they no longer appear as distinct levels, but as the energy bands shown in

Figure 29-1.The lower energy or valence bands are occupied by bonding

electrons in the crystal, and the higher energy or conduction bands are

available for electrons to move from atom to atom.
Notice in Figure 29-1 that the atomic separations for crystalline silicon
and crystalline carbon (diamond) translate to valence bands and conduc-

tion bands that are separated by energy gaps. These gaps have no energy

levels available for electrons. They are called forbidden energy regions. This

description of valence and conduction bands, separated by forbidden

energy gaps, is known as the 
band theoryof solids and can be used to better understand electric conduction. For example, the band diagram in

Figure 29-1
Energy levels of anatom are split apart when other
atoms are brought closer, resulting

in an energy gap between the
valence and conduction bands.774-783 CH29-S1-845813  3/22/04  7:11 AM  Page 776Figure 29-1 suggests that a lot more energy will be required to move
valence electrons from the valence band to the conduction band in the

case of crystalline carbon (diamond structure) compared to silicon.

Carbon in graphite form is a much better conductor because the structure
of the atom arrangement in graphite gives it a smaller energy gap than that

of diamond.Crystalline silicon has a smaller energy gap than diamond does. At
absolute zero, the valence band of silicon would be completely full and

the conduction band would be completely empty. At room temperature,

some number of valence electrons have enough thermal energy to jump

the 1.1-eV gap to the conduction band and serve as charge carriers. As 

the temperature increases and more electrons gain enough energy to jump
the gap, the conductivity of silicon will increase. Germanium has an

energy gap of 0.7 eV, which is smaller than that of silicon. This means that

germanium is a better conductor than silicon at any given temperature.

However, it also means that germanium is too sensitive to heat for many

electronic applications. Relatively small changes in temperature cause large

changes in the conductivity of germanium, making control and stability of
circuits troublesome.
Lead has an interatomic spacing of 0.27 nm. Figure 29-1 shows that this
would translate to a band-gap diagram in which the conduction band

overlaps the v
alence band. One would, therefore, expect lead to be a good
conductor, and it is
. Materials with overlapping, partially filled bands are
conductors, as indicated in 
Figure 29-2.Conductors
When a potential difference is placed across a material, the resultingelectric field exerts a force on the electrons. The electrons accelerate and

gain energy and the field does work on them. If there are bands within the

material that are only partially filled, then there are energy levels available

that are only slightly higher than the electronsÕ ground state levels. As 

a result, the electrons that gain energy from the field can move from one

atom to the next. Such movement of electrons from one atom to the next

is an electric current, and the entire process is known as electric conduc-

tion. Materials with partially filled bands, such as the metals aluminum,

lead, and copper, conduct electricity easily.
Random motionThe free electrons in conductors move about rapidly in
a random way, changing directions when they collide with the cores of the
atoms. However, if an electric field is put across a length of wire, there will

be a net force pushing the electrons in one direction. Although their motion
is not greatly affected, they have a slow overall movement dictated by the

electric field, as shown in 
Figure 29-3.Electrons continue to move rapidly
with speeds of 10
6m/s in random directions, and they drift very slowly 
at speeds of 10
5m/s or slower toward the positive end of the wire. This
model of conductors is called the electron-gas model. If the temperature 
is increased, the speeds of the electrons increase, and, consequently, they

collide more frequently with atomic cores. Thus, as the temperature rises,

the conductivity of metals is reduced. Conductivity is the reciprocal of
resistivity. As conductivity is reduced, a materialÕs resistance rises.

Insulators
In an insulating material, the valence band is filled to capacity and the
conduction band is empty. As shown in 
Figure 29-4,an electron mustgain a large amount of energy to go to the next energy level. In an insula-
tor, the lowest energy level in the conduction band is 5Ð10 eV above the

highest energy level in the valence band, as shown in 
Figure 29-4a.Thereis at least a 5-eV gap of energies that no electrons can possess.

774-783 CH29-S1-845813  3/22/04  7:12 AM  Page 778Although electrons have some kinetic energy as a result of their thermal
energy, the average kinetic energy of electrons at room temperature is not
sufficient for them to jump the forbidden gap. If a small electric field is
placed across an insulator, almost no electrons gain enough energy to

reach the conduction band, so there is no current. Electrons in an insulator
must be given a large amount of energy to be pulled into the conduction

band. As a result, the electrons in an insulator tend to remain in place, and

the material does not conduct electricity.
Semiconductors
Electrons can move more freely in semiconductors than in insulators,
but not as easily as in conductors. As shown in 
Figure 29-4b,
the energygap between the valence band and the conduction band is approximately

1 eV. How does the structure of a semiconductor explain its electronic

characteristics? Atoms of the most common semiconductors, silicon (Si)

and germanium (Ge), each have four valence electrons. These four elec-

trons are involved in binding the atoms together into the solid crystal. The

valence electrons form a filled band, as in an insulator, but the forbidden

gap between the valence and conduction bands is much smaller than in an

insulator. Not much energy is needed to pull one of the electrons from a

silicon atom and put it into the conduction band, as illustrated in Figure29-5a.Indeed, the gap is so small that some electrons reach the conduc-tion band as a result of their thermal kinetic energy alone. That is, the ran-

dom motion of atoms and electrons gives some electrons enough energy

to break free of their home atoms and wander around the silicon crystal. 
If an electric field is applied to a semiconductor, electrons in the con-
duction band move through the solid according to the direction of 

the applied electric field. In contrast to the effect in a metal, the higher the
temperature of a semiconductor, the more able electrons are to reach the

conduction band, and the higher the conductivity.
An atom from which an electron has broken free is said to contain ahole. As shown in 
Figure 29-5b,
a hole is an empty energy level in the
valence band. The atom now has a net positive charge. An electron from

the conduction band can jump into this hole and become bound to an
atom once again. When a hole and a free electron recombine, their oppo-

site charges neutralize each other.

site direction. Pure semiconductors that conduct as a result of thermally
freed electrons and holes are called intrinsic semiconductors.
Because sofew electrons or holes are available to carry charge, conduction in intrinsic

semiconductors is very low, making their resistances very high.

The conductivity of intrinsic semiconductors must be increased greatlyto make practical devices. 
Dopantsare electron donor or acceptor atomsthat can be added in low concentrations to intrinsic semiconductors.
Dopants increase conductivity by making extra electrons or holes available.
The doped semiconductors are known as 
extrinsic semiconductors.
n-type semiconductorsIf an electron donor with five valence electrons,
such as arsenic (As), is used as a dopant for silicon, the product is called
an n-type semiconductor. 
Figure 29-6ashows a location in a silicon crys-
tal where a dopant atom has replaced one of the silicon atoms. Four of 

the five As valence electrons bind to neighboring silicon. The fifth electron

is called the donor electron. The energy of this donor electron is so close
to the conduction band that thermal energy can easily move the electron

from the dopant atom into the conduction band, as shown in 
Figure 29-7a.Conduction in n-type semiconductors is increased by the availability of
these extra donor electrons to the conduction band.p-type semiconductorsIf an electron acceptor with three valence elec-
trons, such as gallium (Ga), is used as a dopant for silicon, the product is
called a p-type semiconductor. When a gallium atom replaces a silicon
atom, one binding electron is missing, creating a hole in the silicon crys-

tal, as shown in 
Figure 29-6b.
Electrons in the conduction band can easilydrop into these holes, creating new holes. Conduction in 
p-type semicon-ductors is enhanced by the availability of the extra holes provided by the

acceptor dopant atoms, as shown in 
Figure 29-7b.
Both p-type and n-type semiconductors are electrically neutral. Adding
dopant atoms of either type does not add any net charge to a semicon-

ductor. Both types of semiconductor use electrons and holes in conduction.

Only a few dopant atoms per million silicon atoms are needed to increase
the conductivity of semiconductors by a factor of 1000 or more.
Silicon is doped by putting a pure silicon crystal in a vacuum with a
sample of the dopant material. The dopant is heated until it is vaporized,

and the atoms condense on the cold silicon. The dopant diffuses into the
silicon on warming, and a thin layer of aluminum or gold is evaporated

onto the doped crystal. A wire is welded to this metal layer, allowing the

user to apply a potential difference across the doped silicon.Section 29.1Conduction in Solids

Thermistors
The electric conductivity of intrinsic and extrinsic semicon-ductors is sensitive to both temperature and light. Unlike metals in which
conductivity is reduced when the temperature rises, an increase in temper-

ature of a semiconductor allows more electrons to reach the conduction

band, and conductivity increases and resistance decreases. One semicon-

ductor device, the thermistor, is designed so that its resistance depends

very strongly on temperature. The thermistor can be used as a sensitive

thermometer and to compensate for temperature variations of other com-

ponents in an electric circuit. Thermistors also can be used to detect radio
waves, 
infrared radiation, and other forms of radiation.Arsenic DonorExcesselectron free

Light metersOther useful applications of semiconductors depend ontheir light sensitivity. When light falls on a semiconductor, the light can
excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band in the same

way that other energy sources excite atoms. Thus, the resistance decreases

as the light intensity increases. Extrinsic semiconductors can be tailored to

respond to specific wavelengths of light. These include the infrared and vis-

ible regions of the spectrum. Materials such as silicon and cadmium sul-
fide serve as light-dependent resistors in light meters used by lighting

engineers to design the illumination of stores, offices, and homes; and by

photographers to adjust their cameras to capture the best images, as shown

in Figure 29-8.774-783 CH29-S1-845813  3/22/04  7:15 AM  Page 783Forward-Biased Diode

and microcomputers, rely on semiconductor devices that are com-
bined on chips of silicon a few millimeters wide. In these devices, current

and voltage vary in more complex ways than are described by OhmÕs law.

As a result, semiconductor devices can change current from AC to DC and

amplify voltages.
Diodes
The simplest semiconductor device is the diode.
A diode consists of asandwichof 
p-type and n-type semiconductors. Rather than two separate
pieces of doped silicon being joined, a single sample of intrinsic silicon is
treated first with a p-dopant, then with an n-dopant. Metal contacts are coatedon each region so that wires can be attached, as shown in 
Figure 29-9a.The boundary between the 
p-type and the n-type regions is called the junction.The resulting device, therefore, is called a 
pn-junction diode.
The free electrons on the n-side of the junction are attracted to the positive holes on the 
p-side. The electrons readily move into the 
p-side and recombine with the holes. Holes from the 
p-side similarly move into
the n-side, where they recombine with electrons. As a result of this flow,
the n-side has a net positive charge, and the 
p-side has a net negative
charge. These charges produce forces in the opposite direction that stop

further movement of charge carriers. The region around the junction is left

with neither holes nor free electrons. This region, depleted of charge carri-

ers, is called the 
depletion layer.
Because it has no charge carriers, it is a
poor conductor of electricity. Thus, a junction diode consists of relatively

good conductors at the ends that surround a poor conductor.

The graph
indicates current-voltage
characteristics for a siliconjunction diode.When a diode is connected into a circuit in the way shown in 
Figure 29-9b,
both the free electrons in the n-type semiconductor and the holesin the p-type semiconductor are attracted toward the battery. The width of
the depletion layer is increased, and no charge carriers meet. Almost no

current passes through the diode: it acts like a very large resistor, almost an

insulator. A diode oriented in this manner is a reverse-biased diode.
If the battery is connected in the opposite direction, as shown in 
Figure 29-9c,charge carriers are pushed toward the junction. If the voltage
of the battery is large enoughÑ0.6 V for a silicon diodeÑelectrons reach
the p-end and fill the holes. The depletion layer is eliminated, and a 
current passes through the diode. The battery continues to supply electrons

for the n-end. It removes electrons from the 
p-end, which is the same assupplying holes. With further increases in voltage from the battery, the cur-

rent increases. A diode in this kind of circuit is a forward-biased diode.
The graph shown in 
Figure 29-10
shows the current through a silicon
diode as a function of voltage across it. If the applied voltage is negative, the

reverse-biased diode acts like a very high-value resistor and only a tiny current

passes (about 10
11A for a silicon diode). If the voltage is positive, the diode
is forward-biased and acts like a low-value resistor, but not, however, one 

that obeys OhmÕs law. One major use of a diode is to convert AC voltage

to DC voltage with only one polarity. When a diode is used in a circuit that

does this, it is called a rectifier. The arrow in the symbol for the diode, which

youÕll see in Example Problem 4, shows the direction of conventional current.

diode. The second approximation takes into account a typical

value for the diode voltage drop. A third approximation uses

additional information about the diode, often in the form of

Diode lasers areused as both light emitters anddetectors in bar-code scanners. 
Light-emitting diodesDiodes made from combinations of gallium andaluminum with arsenic and phosphorus emit light when they are forward-

biased. When electrons reach the holes in the junction, they recombine
and release the excess energy at the wavelengths of light. These diodes are

called light-emitting diodes, or LEDs. Some LEDs are configured to emit a

narrow beam of coherent, monochromatic laser light. Such diode lasers

are compact, powerful light sources. They are used in CD players, laser

pointers, and supermarket bar-code scanners, as shown in 
Figure 29-11.
Diodes can detect light as well as emit it. Light falling on the junction of a

reverse-biased 
pn-junction diode creates electrons and holes, resulting in a
current that depends on the light intensity.

A transistoris a simple device made of doped semiconductor material.An npn-transistor consists of layers of 
n-type semiconductor on either sideof a thin p-type layer. The central layer is called the base and the regions on
either side are the emitter and the collector. The schematic symbols for the
two transistor types are shown in 
Figure 29-12.The arrow on the emitter
shows the direction of conventional current.
The operation of an npn-transistor is illustrated in Figure 29-13.The two
pn-junctions in the transistor can be thought of as initially forming two
back-to-back diodes. The battery on the right, 
VC, keeps the collector morepositive than the emitter. The 
base-collector diode is reverse-biased, with a
wide depletion layer, so there is 
no current from the collector to the base.
When the battery on the left, VB, is connected, the base is more positive
than the emitter. That makes the 
base-emitter diodeforw
ard-biased, allow-
ing current IBfrom the base to the emitter.
The very thin base region is part of both diodes in the transistor. The
charges injected by 
IBreduce the reverse bias of the base-collector diode,
permitting charge to flow from the collector to the emitter. A small change

in IBthus produces a large change in IC.The collector current causes a voltage drop across resistor 
RC. Smallchanges in the voltage, 
VB, applied to the base produce large changes in thecollector current and thus changes in the voltage drop across 
RC. As aresult, the transistor amplifies small voltage changes into much larger

changes. If instead the center layer is an 
n-type region, then the device iscalled a pnp-transistor. A 
pnp-transistor works the same way, except that the
potentials of both batteries are reversed.
Current gain
The current gain from the base circuit to the collector circuitis a useful indicator of the performance of a transistor. Although the base
current is quite small, it is dependent on the base-emitter voltage that is

controlling the collector current. For example, if 
VBin Figure 29-13 isremoved, the collector current will drop to zero. If 
VBis increased, the basecurrent, IB, increases. The collector current, 
IC, will also increase, but many
times more (perhaps 100 times or so). The current gain from the base to

the collector ranges from 50 to 300 for general-purpose transistors.

a coil by magnetized regions on the tape are amplified to move the speaker
coil. In computers, small currents in the base-emitter circuits can turn 

on or turn off large currents in the collector-emitter circuits. In addition,

several transistors can be connected together to perform logic operations

or to add numbers together. In these cases, they act as fast switches rather

than as amplifiers.
Microchips
An integrated circuit, called a microchip,consists of thou-sands of transistors, diodes, resistors, and conductors, each less than a
micrometer across. All these components can be made by doping silicon

with donor or acceptor atoms.  A microchip begins as an extremely pure

single crystal of silicon, 10Ð30 cm in diameter and 1Ð2 m long, as shown

in Figure 29-14.The silicon is sliced by a diamond-coated saw into wafers
less than 1-mm thick. The circuit is then built layer by layer on the surface

of this wafer. 
By a photographic process, most of the waferÕs surface is covered by a
protective layer, with a pattern of selected areas left uncovered so that they

can be doped appropriately. The wafer is then placed in a vacuum chamber.

Vapors of a dopant such as arsenic enter the machine, doping the wafer in

the unprotected regions. By controlling the amount of exposure, the engi-

neer can control the conductivity of the exposed regions of the chip. This
process creates resistors, as well as one of the two layers of a diode or one

of the three layers of a transistor. The protective layer is removed, and

another one with a different pattern of exposed areas is applied. Then the
wafer is exposed to another dopant, often gallium, producing

Microchips formthe heart of the central processing
unit of computers. A penny is
shown in the picture to represent
scale.
Thousands of identical circuits, usually called 
chips,
are produced at onetime on a single wafer. The chips are then tested, sliced apart, and mounted

in a carrier; wires are attached to the contacts; and the final assembly is
then sealed into a protective plastic body. The tiny size of microchips,

shown in 
Figure 29-15,allows the placement of complicated circuits in a
small space. Because electronic signals need only travel tiny distances, this

miniaturization has increased the speed of computers. Chips now are used

in appliances and automobiles as well as in computers.
Semiconductor electronics requires that physicists, chemists, and engi-
neers work together. Physicists contribute their understanding of the

motion of electrons and holes in semiconductors. Physicists and chemists

together add precisely controlled amounts of dopants to extremely pure
silicon. Engineers develop the means of mass-producing chips containing

thousands of miniaturized diodes and transistors. Together, their efforts

have brought our world into this electronic age.

Semiconductor devices, such as diodes and transistors, are fabricated using a
semiconductor that is made of partly p-type material and partly n-type material. Asemiconductor doped with donor atoms is called an n-type semiconductor, while
a semiconductor doped with an element leaving a vacancy or a hole in the lattice

structure is referred to as a p-type semiconductor. A diode is made by doping 
adjacent regions of a semiconductor with donor and acceptor atoms, forming a 

p-njunction. In this lab, you will investigate the voltage and current characteristics
of a diode that is placed in a direct current circuit and compare the response with
your knowledge of resistors.

Extreme Physics1.Debate the IssueAre there ethical
limits to the development of artificial
intelligence?2.Recognize Cause and Effect
What
problems might cause an expert system

to make a poor decision?3.Critical Thinking
In what situationsmust artificial intelligence be absolutely

rational, and in what situations should 
it include human biases?
Going Further
Artificial intelligence also is used to createexpert systems in computers that are pro-
grammed with knowledge about specific topics.

Humans can tell the computer the details of a
specific situation, and the computer calculates
the most logical course of action. In a medicalenvironment, an expert system can be used to
accurately diagnose disorders. Artificial intelli-
gence weighs the facts 
of the situation and theninfers which actions are most appropriate.

However, artificial intelligence can operate 

only with facts that have been taught to the

computer. Users must constantly be aware of

this limitation of expert systems.
Artificial IntelligenceThe phrase 
artificial intelligencewas first
used in 1955. It is defined as Òthe scientificunderstanding of the mechanisms underlyingthought and intelligent behavior and their
embodiment in machines.Ó Sometimes, a task

needs artificial intelligence to be very logical.

At other times, it may need artificial intelli-

gence to think and behave
 withhuman biases.
The goals in the field of artificial intelligence
are to develop systems that can do both.
ApplicationsArtificial intelligence alreadyis used in many areas, and it will do even more

for us in the future. When a computer plays

chess, it searches through hundreds of thou-

sands of possible moves before selecting the

best one. Research is being done to improve

the efficiency of search algorithms.
Artificial intelligence currently is used forspeech recognition to allow hands-free dialing of

cell phones and for some interactive telephone

transactions. It is not yet fully capable of under-

standing natural language, but that is a goal.
Three-dimensional computer vision isanother future application. To mimic the 
sensory input and behaviors of humans, com-

puters need to extract three-dimensional reality
from two-dimensional images. Progress has

been made, but humans are still much better

than computers at this. With improved vision,

artificial intelligence may control automobiles

on Earth, or robots exploring another planet,
with no human navigators needed.
CareersStudying mathematics, mathematical
logic, and computer programming languages is important for developing systems that can

make rational decisions. Knowledge of psy-

chology assures that these decisions also can
have a human character.

Key Concepts
¥Electric conduction may be explained by the band theory of solids.
¥In solids, the allowed energy levels for outer electrons in an atom are spread
into broad bands by the electric fields of electrons on neighboring atoms.
¥The valence and conduction bands are separated by forbidden energy gaps;

that is, by regions of energy levels that electrons may not possess. 
¥In conductors, electrons can move through the solid because the conduction

band is partially filled. ¥Electrons in metals have a fast random motion. A potential difference across

the metal causes a slow drift of electrons, called an electric current. 
¥In insulators, more energy is needed to move electrons into the conduction

band than is generally available. 
¥Conduction in semiconductors is enhanced by doping pure crystals with

small amounts of other kinds of atoms, called dopants. 
¥n-type semiconductors are doped with electron donor atoms, and they conduct
by the response of these donor electrons to applied potential differences.
¥Arsenic, with five valence electrons, is an example of a donor atom.
¥p-type semiconductors are doped with electron acceptor atoms, and they
conduct by making holes available to electrons in the conduction band.
¥Gallium, with three valence electrons, is an example of an acceptor atom.
Key Concepts
¥A pn-junction diode consists of a layer of a 
p-type semiconductor joined witha layer of an 
n-type semiconductor.
¥Diodes conduct charges in one direction only. They can be used in rectifier

circuits to convert AC to DC. 
¥Electrons and holes near either side of the diode junction combine to
produce a region without charge carriers known as the depletion layer.
¥Applying a potential difference of the proper polarity across the diode makes
the depletion layer even wider, no current is observed, and the diode is said

to be reverse-biased.
¥Reversing the polarity of the applied potential across the diode greatly

reduces the depletion layer, current is observed, and the diode is said to 

be forward-biased.
¥A transistor is a sandwich of three layers of semiconductor material,

configured as either npn- or pnp-layers. The center base layer is very thin
compared to the other layers, the emitter and collector.
¥A transistor can act as an amplifier to convert a weak signal into a much

stronger one.
¥The ratio of the collector-emitter current to the base current is known as the

current gain and is a useful measure of transistor amplification.¥Conductivity of semiconductors increases with increasing temperature or
illumination, making them useful as thermometers or light meters. Diodes

that emit light when a potential is applied are used in optical devices.

mass defectErnest Rutherford not only established the existence of the nucleus,

but he also conducted some of the early experiments to discover its
structure. It is important to realize that neither RutherfordÕs experiments,

nor the experiments of those who followed, offered the opportunity to

observe the atom directly. Instead, inferences were drawn from the obser-

vations that researchers made. Recall from Chapter 28 that RutherfordÕs

team made careful measurements of the deflection of alpha particles as
they hit gold foil. These deflections could be explained if the atom was

mostly empty space. The experiment showed that the atom had a small,

dense, positively charged center surrounded by nearly massless electrons.
After the discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel in 1896, he and others
looked at the effects produced when a nucleus breaks apart in natural
radioactive decay. Marie and Pierre Curie discovered the new element

radium and made it available to researchers all over the world, thereby

increasing the study of radioactivity. Scientists discovered that through

radioactivity one kind of atom could change into another kind, and thus,

atoms must be made up of smaller parts. Ernest Rutherford and Fredrick

Soddy used radioactivity to probe the center of the atom, the nucleus.

Description of the Nucleus
Are nuclei made up only of positively charged particles? At first, only the
mass of the nucleus and the fact that the charge was positive were known.

The magnitude of the charge of the nucleus was found as a result of X-ray

scattering experiments done by Henry Moseley, a member of RutherfordÕs

team. The results showed that the positively charged protons accounted for

roughly half the mass of the nucleus. One hypothesis was that the extra

mass was the result of protons, and that electrons in the nucleus reduced

the charge to the observed value. This hypothesis, however, had some fun-

damental problems. In 1932, English physicist James Chadwick solved the

problem when he discovered a neutral particle that had a mass approxi-

mately that of the proton. This particle, known as the neutron, accounted

for the missing mass of the nucleus without increasing its charge.
Mass and charge of the nucleusThe only charged particle in thenucleus is the proton. The atomic number,
Z,of an atom is the numberof protons. The total charge of the nucleus is the number of protons times
the elementary charge, 
e.nuclear chargeZeBoth the proton and the neutron have a mass that is about 1800 times 

the mass of an electron. The proton and neutron masses are approximately
equal to 1 u, where u is the atomic mass unit, 1.661027kg. To deter-
mine the approximate mass of the nucleus, multiply the number of 

neutrons and protons, or 
mass number,
A,by u.
nuclear massA(u)Size of the nucleusRutherfordÕs experiments produced the first meas-
urements of the size of the nucleus. He found that the nucleus has a

diameter of about 10
14m. A typical atom might have a radius 10,000
times larger than the size of the nucleus. Although the nucleus contains

nearly all of the mass of an atom, proportionally the nucleus occupies less
space in the atom than the Sun does in the solar system. The nucleus is

incredibly denseÑabout 1.41018kg/m3. If a nucleus could be one cubiccentimeter, it would have a mass of about one billion tons.
798-805 CH30-S1-845813  6/10/04  9:04 PM  Page 800Do all elements have the same mass numbers?
Looking at the periodic table on page 916, you might notice that the 
first four elements all have an atomic mass, 
A, near a whole number.
Boron, on the other hand, has a mass of 10.8 u. If the nucleus is made up
of only protons and neutrons, each with a mass of approximately 1 u,

shouldnÕt the total mass of any atom be near a whole number?
The puzzle of atomic masses that were not whole numbers was solved
with the mass spectrometer. You learned in Chapter 26 how the mass spec-

trometer demonstrated that an element could have atoms with different

masses. For example, in an analysis of a pure sample of neon, not one, but

two spots appeared on the film of the spectrometer. The two spots were

produced by neon atoms of different masses. One variety of the neon atom

was found to have a mass of 20 u, while the second type had a mass of 22 u.

All neutral neon atoms have 10 protons in the nucleus and 10 electrons in

the atom. One kind of neon atom, however, has 10 neutrons in its nucleus,

while the other has 12 neutrons. The two kinds of atoms are called 
isotopesof neon. The nucleus of an isotope is called a nuclide.
All nuclides of an element have the same number of protons, but have
different numbers of neutrons, as illustrated by the hydrogen and helium

nuclides shown in 
Figure 30-1.All isotopes of a neutral element have the
same number of electrons around the nucleus and behave chemically in

the same way.
Average mass
The measured mass of neon gas is 20.183 u. This figure is
now understood to be the average mass of the naturally occurring isotopes
of neon. Thus, while the mass of an individual atom of neon is close to a

whole number of mass units, the atomic mass determined from an average 

sample of neon atoms is not. Most elements have several isotopic forms

that occur naturally. The mass of one isotope of carbon, carbon-12, is now

used to define the mass unit. One u is defined to be 112the mass of the carbon-12 isotope.
A special method of notation is used to describe an isotope. A subscript
representing the atomic number, or charge, 
Z,is written to the left of thesymbol for  the element. A superscript written to the left of the symbol 

is the mass number, 
A.This notation takes the form AZX, where Xis any 
element. For example, carbon-12 is 
126C, and the two isotopes of neon,
with atomic number 10, are written as 
2010Ne and 2210Ne.

The negatively charged electrons that surround the positively charged
nucleus of an atom are held in place by the attractive electromagnetic
force. Because the nucleus consists of positively charged protons and neu-

tral neutrons, the repulsive electromagnetic force among the protons

might be expected to cause them to fly apart. Because this does not hap-
pen, an even stronger attractive force must exist within the nucleus.
The Strong Nuclear Force
The strong nuclear force,
also called the strong force, acts between
protons and neutrons that are close together, as they are in a nucleus. This

force is more than 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force. The

range of the strong force is short, only about the radius of a proton,
1.41015m. It is attractive and is of the same strength among protons
and protons, protons and neutrons, and neutrons and neutrons. 
Both neutrons and protons are called nucleons.
The strong nuclearforce holds the nucleons in the nucleus. If a nucleon were to be pulled out

of a nucleus, work would have to be done to overcome the attractive force.

Doing work adds energy to the system. Thus, the assembled nucleus has

less energy than the separate protons and neutrons that make it up. The
difference is the binding energyof the nucleus. Because the assembled
nucleus has less energy, all binding energies are negative.
Binding Energy of the Nucleus
Einstein showed that mass and energy areequivalent, so the binding
energy can be expressed in the form of an equivalent amount of mass,

according to the following equation.
Because energy has to be added to take a nucleus apart, the mass of theassembled nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of the nucleons that
compose it.For example, the helium nucleus, 
42He, consists of two protons and two
neutrons. The mass of a proton is 1.007276 u. The mass of a neutron is
1.008665 u. If the mass of the helium nucleus were equal to the sum of

the masses of the two protons and the two neutrons, you would expect that

the mass of the nucleus would be 4.031882 u. Careful measurement, how-

ever, shows that the mass of a helium nucleus is only 4.002603 u. The

actual mass of the helium nucleus is less than the mass of its constituent
parts by 0.029279 u. The difference between the sum of the masses of the

individual nucleons and the actual mass is called the mass defect.Mass spectrometers usually measure the masses of isotopes; that is, the
nuclides with all their electrons. When calculating the mass defect of a

nucleus, one must make sure that the mass of the electrons is accounted

for properly. Thus, the mass of hydrogen (one proton and one electron)

usually is given in mass-defect problems.
Energy Equivalent of Mass
Emc2The energy contained in matter is equal to the mass times the square of the
speed of light in a vacuum.802Chapter 30Nuclear Physics
Forces
A positron is apositively charged electron. The
electromagnetic attraction of 
an electron and a positron is
4.21042times stronger than 
their gravitational attraction.
798-805 CH30-S1-845813  6/8/04  7:52 PM  Page 802Masses normally are measured in atomic mass units. It will be useful,
then, to determine the energy equivalent of 1 u (1.6605
1027kg). To
determine the energy, you must multiply the mass by the square of the
speed of light in a vacuum (2.9979
108m/s). This is expressed to five 
significant digits.

E(1.49241010J)(1 eV/1.60217
1019J)9.3149
108eV931.49 MeV
Hence, 1 u of mass is equivalent to 931.49 MeV of energy. 
Figure 30-2shows how the binding energy per nucleon depends on the mass of the

nucleus. Heavier nuclei are bound more strongly than lighter nuclei.

Except for a few nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon becomes more
negative as the mass number, 
A,increases to a value of 56, which is that of
iron, Fe. The most tightly bound nucleus is 
5626Fe; thus, nuclei become more
stable as their mass numbers approach that of iron. Nuclei whose massnumbers are larger than that of iron are less strongly bound, and are there-
fore less stable.
A nuclear reaction will occur naturally if energy is released by the reac-
tion; that is, if the nucleus is transformed into one closer to the lowpoint

of the graph at A56. At lower mass numbers, below 
5626Fe, a nuclear 
reaction will occur naturally if it increases the atomic mass. In the Sun and
other stars, hydrogen is 
converted into helium, carbon, and other heavier
elements in a reaction that releases energy, causing the electromagnetic

radiation that you experience as visible light.

21At mass numbers above 56, a nuclear reaction will occur naturally if it
decreases the atomic mass. When uranium-238 decays to thorium-234, the
resulting thorium nucleus is more stable than the uranium nucleus. Energy

is released in the form of a radioactive particle with mass and kinetic

energy. Thorium will not spontaneously transform into uranium because

energy would have to be added to the nucleus. The heaviest nuclei in the

periodic table are created in this way, by slamming together smaller nuclei

in particle accelerators. In general, such heavy elements can exist only for

fractions of a second before the nuclei decay into smaller, more stable

nuclei. In contrast, when small nuclei gain nucleons, the binding energy of

the larger nucleus is more negative, and thus, more stable than the sum of

the binding energies of the smaller nuclei.In the next section, calculations of binding energy will be used to under-stand nuclear reactions. The binding energy explains the energy released

when small nuclei fuse, as in stars, and large nuclei split, as in the decay of

radioactive elements.

In few areas of physics has basic knowledge led to applications as
quickly as in the field of nuclear physics. The medical use of the radioac-
tive element radium began within 20 years of its discovery. Proton acceler-

ators were used for medical applications less than one year after being

invented. In the case of nuclear fission (splitting nuclei), the military

application was under development before the basic physics was even

known. Peaceful applications followed in less than ten years.
798-805 CH30-S1-845813  6/8/04  7:53 PM  Page 805In 1896, Henri Becquerel was working with compounds containing the
element uranium. To his surprise, he found that photographic plates
that had been covered to keep out light became fogged, or partially

exposed, when these uranium compounds were anywhere near the plates.

This fogging suggested that some kind of ray from the uranium had passed

through the plate coverings. Several materials other than uranium or its

compounds also were found to emit these penetrating rays. Materials that

emit this kind of radiation are now said to be 
radioactive.
Because parti-cles are emitted from the material, it is said to decay. Nuclei decay from a

less stable form to a more stable form. Radioactivity is a natural process.
Radioactive Decay
In 1899, Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues discovered that the element
radon spontaneously splits into a lighter nucleus and a light helium nucleus.

That same year, Rutherford also discovered that uranium compounds pro-

duce three different kinds of radiation. He separated the types of radiation
according to their penetrating ability and named them (alpha), (beta),and (gamma) radiation. Alpha radiation can be stopped by a thick sheet
of paper, while 6 mm of aluminum is needed to stop most beta particles.

Several centimeters of lead are required to stop gamma rays.
Alpha decayAn alpha particle is the nucleus of a helium atom, 42He. The
emission of an particle from a nucleus is a process called alpha decay.
The mass number of an particle, 
4
2He, is 4, and the atomic number is 2.
When a nucleus emits an particle, the mass number, 
A,of the decaying
nucleus is reduced by 4, and the atomic number of the nucleus, 
Z,isreduced by 2. The element changes, or transmutes, into a different element.
For example, 
23892U transmutes into 23490Th through alpha decay.
Beta decayBeta particles are electrons emitted by the nucleus. The
nucleus contains no electrons, however, so where do these electrons come

from? Beta decay
occurs when a neutron is changed to a proton within thenucleus. In all reactions, charge must be conserved. That is, the charge

before the reaction must equal the charge after the reaction. In beta decay,

when a neutron, charge 0, changes to a proton, charge 1, an electron,charge 1, also appears. In beta decay, a nucleus with 
Nneutrons and Zprotons ends up as a nucleus of N1 neutrons and Z1 protons. Another
particle, an antineutrino, also is emitted in beta decay. 
Gamma decayA redistribution of the energy within the nucleus results in gamma decay.
The ray is a high-energy photon. Neither the mass
number nor the atomic number is changed in gamma decay. Gamma radi-
ation often accompanies alpha and beta decay. The three types of radiation

are summarized in Table 30-1.
Radioactive elements often go through a series of successive decays until
they form a stable nucleus. For example, 
23892U undergoes 14 separatedecays before the stable lead isotope 
206
82Pb is produced.806Chapter 30Nuclear Physics

A nuclear reaction occurs whenever the energy or number of neutrons
or protons in a nucleus changes. Just as in chemical reactions, some
nuclear reactions occur with a release of energy, while others occur only
when energy is added to a nucleus.
One form of nuclear reaction is the emission of particles by radioactive
nuclei. The reaction releases excess energy in the form of the kinetic energy
of the emitted particles. Two such reactions are shown in 
Figure 30-3.Nuclear reactions can be described by words, diagrams, or equations.
The symbols used for the nuclei in nuclear equations make the calculation

of atomic number and mass number in nuclear reactions simpler. For

example, the equation for the reaction in 
Figure 30-3ais as follows.
23892U23490Th42HeThe total number of nuclear particles stays the same during the reaction,
so the sum of the superscripts on each side must be equal: 238234 4.The total charge also is conserved, so the sum of the subscripts on each

side must be equal: 9290 
2.In beta decay, an electron, 
10e, and an antineutrino, 
00, are produced.(The symbol for the antineutrino is the Greek letter 
nuwith a bar over it;
the bar denotes a particle of antimatter.) The transmutation of a thorium
atom by the emission of a 
particle is shown in

The time required for half of the atoms in any given 
quantity of a radioactive isotope to decay is the 
half-lifeofthat element. After each half-life, the number of undecayed
nuclei is cut in half, as shown in 
Figure 30-4.Each particu-lar isotope has its own half-life. 
For example, the half-life of the radium isotope 
22688Ra is 
1600 years. That is, in 1600 y
ears, half 
of a given quantity of
22688Ra decays into another element, radon. In a second 1600
years, half of the remaining sample of radium will have

decayed. In other words, one-fourth of the original amount

still will remain after 3200 years. In contrast, a sample of

polonium-210 will decay to one-fourth the original amount

in just 276 days.

used to date objects. The age of a sample of

organic material can be found by measur-

ing the amount of carbon-14 remaining.
The age of Earth was calculated based on

the decay of uranium into lead.
The decay rate, or number of decays per second, of a radioactive 
substance is called its activity.
Activity is proportional to the number 
of radioactive atoms present. Therefore, the activity of a particular 

sample also is reduced by one-half in one half-life. Consider
131
53I, with ahalf-life of 8.07 days. If the activity of a certain sample of iodine-131 is

8105decays/s, then 8.07 days later, its activity will be 4
105decays/s.
After another 8.07 days, its activity will be 2
105decays/s. The activity of 
a sample also is related to its half-life. The shorter the half-life, the higher 
the activity. 
Consequently, if you know the activity of a substance and the
amount of that substance, you can determine its half-life. The SI unit for

decays per second is a Becquerel (Bq).

Radioactive isotopes can be formed from stable isotopes by bombard-
ment with particles, protons, neutrons, electrons, or gamma rays. The
resulting unstable nuclei emit radiation until they are converted 
into stable isotopes. The radioactive nuclei may emit alpha, beta, and

gamma radiation, as well as neutrinos, antineutrinos, and positrons. (A

positron is a positively charged electron, 
10e.) 
Artificially produced radioactive isotopes often are used in medicine
and medical research. In many medical applications, patients are given
radioactive isotopes of elements that are absorbed by specific parts of the

body. A physician uses a radiation counter to monitor the activity in the

region in question. A radioactive isotope also can be attached to a mole-

cule that will be absorbed in the area of interest, as is done in positron
emission tomography, better known as the PET scan. A PET scan of a brain

is shown in 
Figure 30-5.Radiation often is used to destroy cancer cells. These cells are more 
sensitive to the damaging effects of radiation because they divide more

often than normal cells. Gamma rays from the isotope 
6027Co are used totreat cancer patients. Radioactive iodine is injected to target thyroid cancer.

In a third method, particles produced in a particle accelerator are beamed
into tissue in such a way that they decay in the cancerous tissue and

destroy the cells.
Nuclear Fission
The possibility of obtaining useful forms of energy from nuclear reac-tions was discussed in the 1930s. The most promising results came from

bombarding substances with neutrons. In Italy, in 1934, Enrico Fermi and

Emilio Segr” produced many new radioactive isotopes by bombarding ura-

nium with neutrons. German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann

showed in 1939 that the resulting atoms acted chemically like barium.

One week later, Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch proposed that the neutrons

had caused a division of the uranium into two smaller nuclei, resulting in

a large release of energy. Such a division of a nucleus into two or more

fragments is called fission.The possibility that fission could be not only asource of energy, but also an explosive weapon, was immediately realized

by many scientists.
Fission occurs when a nucleus is divided into two or more fragments,
releasing neutrons and energy. The uranium isotope, 
23592U, undergoes fissionwhen it is bombarded with neutrons. The elements barium and krypton

are typical results of fission. The reaction is illustrated with the following

equation.10n 23592U92
36Kr 141
56Ba 31
0n 200 MeV
The energy released by each fission can be found by calculating the 
masses of the atoms on each side of the equation. In the uranium-235
reaction, the total mass on the right side of the equation is 0.215 u smaller

than that on the left. The energy equivalent of this mass is 3.21
1011J, or 2.00102MeV. This energy appears as the kinetic energy of the products
of the fission.Section 30.2Nuclear Decay and Reactions
811Radiation Treatment
Gammarays destroy both cancerous cells
and healthy cells; thus, the beams
of radiation must be directed onlyat cancerous cells.
Figure 30-5
For a PET scan,
physicians inject a solution inwhich a radioactive isotope, such
as 189F, is attached to a molecule
that will concentrate in the target

tissues. When the 
189F decays, 
it produces positrons, which

annihilate nearby electrons,
producing gamma rays. The PET

scanner detects the gamma rays.

A computer then makes a three-

dimensional map of the isotope
distribution. Here, a normal brain
(top), and the brain of a person
suffering from dementia (bottom)are contrasted.CNRI/Photo Researchers806-814 CH30-S2-845813  3/31/04  12:58 AM  Page 811The neutrons needed to cause the fission of additional 23592U nuclei canbe the neutrons produced once the fission process is started. If one or more of the neutrons cause a fission, that fission releases three more 
neutrons, each of which can cause more fission. This continual process of

repeated fission reactions caused by the release of neutrons from previous

fission reactions is called a chain reaction.The process is illustrated inFigure 30-6.Nuclear Reactors
To create a controlled chain reaction and make use of the energy pro-
duced, the neutrons need to interact with the fissionable uranium at the
right rate. Most of the neutrons released by the fission of 
23592U atoms aremoving at high speeds. These are called fast neutrons. In addition, natu-

rally occurring uranium consists of less than one percent 23592U and morethan 99 percent 23892U. When a 23892U nucleus absorbs a fast neutron, it doesnot undergo fission, but becomes a new isotope, 
23992U. The absorption ofneutrons by 
23892U keeps most of the neutrons from reaching the fissionable23592U atoms. Thus, most neutrons released by the fission of
23592U are unableto cause the fission of another 23592U atom.To control the reaction, the uranium is broken up into small pieces and
placed in a moderator,
a material that can slow down, or moderate, the fast
neutrons. When a neutron collides with a light atom it transfers momen-

tum and energy to the atom. In this way, the neutron loses energy. The

moderator thus slows many fast neutrons to speeds at which they can be

absorbed more easily by 
23592U than by 
23892U. The larger number of slow
neutrons greatly increases the probability that a neutron released by the

fission of a 23592U nucleus will cause another 23592U nucleus to fission. If thereis enough 23592U in the sample, a chain reaction can occur. To increase the
amount of fissionable uranium, the uranium may be enriched by adding

more 23592U. Both types of uranium are used in nuclear reactors.

806-814 CH30-S2-845813  3/31/04  12:59 AM  Page 812The type of nuclear reactor used in the United States, the pressurized
water reactor, contains about 200 metric tons of uranium sealed in hun-
dreds of metal rods. The rods are immersed in water, as shown in 
Figure30-7.Water not only is the moderator, but also transfers thermal energy
away 
from the fission of uranium. Rods of cadmium metal are placed
between the uranium rods. Cadmium absorbs neutrons easily and also

acts as a moderator. The cadmium rods are moved in and out of the reactor

to control the rate of the chain reaction. Thus, the rods are called control

rods. When the control rods are inserted completely into the reactor, they

absorb enough of the neutrons released by the fission reactions to prevent

any further chain reaction. As the control rods are removed from the reac-

tor, the rate of energy release increases, with more free neutrons available

to continue the chain reaction.Energy released by the fission heats the water surrounding the uranium
rods. The water itself doesnÕt boil because it is under high pressure, which

increases its boiling point. As shown in 
Figure 30-8,this water is pumped
to a heat exchanger, where it causes other water to boil, producing steam

that turns turbines. The turbines are connected to generators that produce

electrical energy.
Fission of 23592U nuclei produces Kr, Ba, and other atoms in the fuel rods.
Most of these atoms are radioactive. About once a year, some of the ura-

nium fuel rods must be replaced. The old rods no longer can be used in
the reactor, but they are still extremely radioactive and must be stored in a

location that can be secured. Methods of permanently storing these
radioactive waste products currently are being developed. 
Nuclear Fusion
In nuclear fusion,nuclei with small masses combine to form a nucleuswith a larger mass, as shown in 
Figure 30-9 on the next page. In the process,
energy is released. You learned earlier in this chapter that the larger nucleus

is more tightly bound, so its mass is less than the sum of the masses of the
smaller nuclei. This loss of mass corresponds to a release of energy.

Critical ThinkingAlpha emitters are used insmoke detectors. An emitter is mounted on one
plate of a capacitor, and the 
particles strike the
other plate. As a result, there is a potential differ-

ence across the plates. Explain and predict which

plate has the more positive potential. 30.2Section Review
An example of fusion is theprocess that occurs in the Sun. Four
hydrogen nuclei (protons) fuse in

several steps to form one helium

nucleus. The mass of the four pro-

tons is greater than the mass of the
helium nucleus that is produced.
The energy equivalent of this mass

difference appears as the kinetic
energy of the resultant particles.

The energy released by the fusion
that produces one helium-4 nucleus is 25 MeV. In com
parison, the energyreleased when one dynamite molecule reacts chemically is 
about 20 eV,
about 1 million times smaller. 
There are several processes by which fusion occurs in the Sun. The most
important process is the proton-proton chain.11H 1

3
2He particlesneeded for the final reaction. The net result (subtracting out the two protons
produced in the final step) is that four protons produce one 42He, two
positrons, and two neutrinos. 
The repulsive force between the charged nuclei requires the fusing
nuclei to have high energies. Thus, fusion reactions take place only when

the nuclei have large amounts of thermal energy. The proton-proton chain

requires a temperature of about 2107K, such as that found in the centerof the Sun. Fusion reactions also occur in a hydrogen, or thermonuclear,

bomb. In this device, the high temperature necessary to produce the fusion

reaction is produced by exploding a uranium fission, or atomic, bomb.

The first physicists who studied the nucleus with high speed particles
had to make do with particles from radioactive sources. Other
experimenters used cosmic rays, 
produced by not-yet-understood
processes in stars and galaxies. In the early 1930s, the first laboratory

devices that could accelerate protons and particles to energies highenough to penetrate the nucleus were developed. Two devices, the linear

accelerator and the synchrotron, are regularly used today.
Linear Accelerators
A linear accelerator can be used to accelerate protons or electrons. It
consists of a series of hollow tubes within a long, evacuated chamber. The

tubes are connected to a source of high-frequency alternating voltage, as

illustrated in Figure 30-10.
Protons are produced in an ion source similarto that described in Chapter 26. When the first tube has a negative poten-

tial, protons are accelerated into it. There is no electric field within the
tube, so the protons move at a constant velocity. The length of the tube and

the frequency of the voltage are adjusted so that when the protons have

reached the far end of the tube, the potential of the second tube is nega-

tive in relation to that of the first. The resulting electric field in the gap

between the tubes accelerates the protons into the second tube. This

process continues, with the protons receiving an acceleration between 

each pair of tubes. The energy of the protons is increased by 10
5eV witheach acceleration. The protons ride along the crest of an electric field wave, 

much as a surfboard moves on the ocean. At the end of the accelerator, the

protons can have energies of many millions or billions of electron volts. A

similar method is used to accelerate electrons. Note that one can acceler-

ate only charged particles.

815-823 CH30-S3-845813  3/31/04  1:04 AM  Page 815The Synchrotron
An accelerator may be made smaller by using a magnetic field to bend
the path of the particles into a circle. In a synchrotron, the bending magnets
are separated by accelerating regions, as shown in 
Figure 30-11b.
In thestraight regions, high-frequency alternating voltage accelerates the parti-
cles. The strength of the magnetic field and the length of the path are 

chosen so that the particles reach the location of the alternating electric
field precisely when the fieldÕs polarity will accelerate them. One of the

largest synchrotrons in operation is at the Fermi National Accelerator

Laboratory near Chicago, shown in 
Figure 30-11a.
Protons there reachenergies of 1 TeV (10
12eV). A proton beam and an antiproton beam travel
the circle in opposite directions. (An antiproton is the antimatter pair to a

proton; it has the same mass and opposite charge.) The beams collide in

several interaction regions and the results are studied.
Particle Detectors
Once particles are produced, the results of the collision need to bedetected. In other words, they need to interact with matter in such a way

that we can sense them with our relatively limited human senses. Your

hand will stop an particle, yet you will have no idea that the particle
struck you. And as you read this sentence, billions of solar neutrinos pass

through your body without so much as a twitch from you. Over the past

century, scientists have devised tools to detect and distinguish the products

of nuclear reactions.
In the last section, you learned that uranium samples fogged photo-
graphic plates. When 
particles, 
particles, or gamma rays strike photo-
graphic film, the film becomes fogged, or exposed. Thus, photographic

film can be used to detect radiation. Many other devices are used to detect

charged particles and gamma rays. Most of these devices make use of the

fact that a collision with a high-speed particle will remove electrons from

atoms. That is, the high-speed particles ionize the matter that they bom-

bard. In addition, some substances fluoresce, or emit photons, when they

are exposed to certain types of radiation. Thus, fluorescent substances also

can be used to detect radiation. These three means of detecting radiation
are illustrated in Figure 30-12.816Chapter 30Nuclear Physics

abcourtesy of Fermilab815-823 CH30-S3-845813  3/31/04  1:30 AM  Page 816Geiger counterA Geiger-Mueller tube contains a copper cylinder with anegative charge. Down the center of this cylinder runs a rigid wire with 
a positive charge. The voltage across the wire and cylinder is kept just

below the point at which a spontaneous discharge, or spark, occurs. When

a charged particle or gamma ray enters the tube, it ionizes a gas atom

between the copper cylinder and the wire. The positive ion that is pro-

duced is accelerated toward the copper cylinder by the potential difference,

and the electron is accelerated toward the positive wire. As these charged

particles move toward the electrodes, they create an avalanche of charged

particles, and a pulse of current goes through the tube. 
Condensation trails
A device once used to detect particles was the Wilson
cloud chamber. The chamber contained an area supersaturated with water
vapor or ethanol vapor. When charged particles traveled through the

chamber, leaving a trail of ions in their paths, vapor condensed into small

droplets on the ions. In this way, visible trails of droplets, or fog, were

formed. In a similar detector still used today, the bubble chamber, charged

particles pass through a liquid held just above the boiling point. In this

case, the trails of ions cause small vapor bubbles to form, marking the 

particlesÕ trajectories, as shown in 
Figure 30-13.Recent technology has produced detection chambers called wire cham-
bers that are like giant Geiger-Mueller tubes. Huge plates are separated by

a small gap filled with a low-pressure gas. A discharge is produced in the

path of a particle passing through the chamber. A computer locates the dis-

charge and records its position for later analysis. 
Neutral particles do not leave trails because they do not produce dis-
charges. The laws of conservation of energy and momentum in collisions

can be used to tell if any neutral particles were produced. Other detectors

measure the energy of the particles. The entire array of detectors used in

high-energy accelerator experiments, such as the Collider Detector at

Fermilab (CDF), can be up to three stories high, as shown in 
Figure 30-14a.The CDF is designed to monitor a quarter-million particle collisions each
second, as though the detector functioned as a 5000-ton camera, creating

a computer picture of the collision events, as shown in 
Figure 30-14b.

The model of the atom in 1930 was fairly simple: protons and neutrons
surrounded by electrons. There also was a particle with no mass called a
gamma particle (photon). Different combinations of these four elemen-
tary particles seemed to describe the contents of the universe quite well.
More detailed studies of radioactive decay disturbed this simple picture.
While the particles and gamma rays emitted by radioactive nuclei have
single energies that depend on the decaying nucleus, 
particles are emit-ted with a wide range of energies. One might expect the energy of the 

particles to be equal to the difference between the energy of the nucleus
before decay and the energy of the nucleus produced by the decay. In fact,

the wide range of energies of electrons emitted during beta decay suggested

to Niels Bohr that energy might not be conserved in nuclear reactions.

Wolfgang Pauli in 1931 and Enrico Fermi in 1934 suggested that an unseen

neutral particle was emitted with the 
particle. Named the neutrino (Òlittle
neutral oneÓ in Italian) by Fermi, the particle, which is actually an anti-

neutrino, was not directly observed until 1956.
Studies with cosmic rays discovered more particles. A positive electron,
or positron, was found in 1932, and what seemed to be a heavy electron,

the muon, in 1937. In 1935, a remarkable hypothesis by Japanese physi-

cist Hideki Yukawa spurred much research in the years to follow. Yukawa

hypothesized the existence of a new particle that could carry the nuclear

force through space, just as the photon carries the electromagnetic force. 

In 1947 a possible particle, the pion, was discovered. While it was not the

carrier of the strong force, it was a new type of matter.
Experiments with particle accelerators resulted in the identification ofmore and more particles, some with intermediate masses, others much

more massive than the proton. They had positive and negative charges, or

none at all. Some lifetimes were 10
23s, while others had no detectable
decays. Most mysterious were the chargeless, massless neutrinos. At one

point Enrico Fermi, asked to identify a particle track, replied ÒIf I could

remember the names of all these particles, IÕd be a botanist!Ó
The Standard Model
How could all these particles be called Òelementary?Ó By the late 1960s
it became clear that neither protons, neutrons, nor pions were Òelemen-

tary.Ó They themselves are made up of particles called 
quarks,
as shown in
Figure 30-15.Electrons and neutrinos belong to a different family, called
leptons.
Physicists now believe that all particles can be grouped into three
families: quarks, leptons, and force carriers. This model of the building

blocks of matter is called the Standard Model.Quarks make up the three-quark baryons, the two-quark mesons, and the recently discovered five-

quark pentaquarks. Leptons are particles like electrons and neutrinos.

There are six different quarks and six different leptons. Quarks and leptons

form matter, while 
force carriersare particles that carry, or transmit,
forces between matter. For example, photons carry the electromagnetic

interaction. Eight particles, called gluons, carry the strong nuclear interac-

tion that binds quarks into protons and the protons and neutrons 
into nuclei. Three particles, the weak bosons, are involved in beta decay.

The quark model describes nucleons, the proton and the neutron, as 
an assembly of quarks. The nucleons each are made up of three quarks.

The proton has two up quarks, u, (charge
23e) and one down quark, d,
(charge 1
3e). A proton is described as puud. The charge on the proton is the sum of the charges of the three quarks, (

holds them together becomes larger as the quarks are pulled farther apart.In this case, the strong force acts like the force of a spring. It is unlike the

electric force, which becomes weaker as charged particles are moved farther

apart. In the quark model, the strong force is transmitted by gluons.
Antimatter
The positive electron, or positron, is an example of an antiparticle, a 
particle of antimatter. The electron and positron have the same mass and

charge magnitude; however, the signs of their charges are opposite. When

a positron and an electron collide, the two can annihilate each other,

resulting in energy in the form of gamma rays, as shown in 
Figure 30-17.815-823 CH30-S3-845813  3/31/04  1:06 AM  Page 819Conversions between mass and energy
The amount of energy createdin the annihilation can be calculated using EinsteinÕs equation for the energy
equivalent of mass, 
Emc2.The mass of the electron is 9.11
1031kg.The mass of the positron is the same. Therefore, the energy equivalent of

the positron and the electron together can be calculated as follows.
E2(9.11
1031kg)(3.00108m/s)2E(1.641013J)(1 eV / 1.601019 J)E1.02
106eV or 1.02 MeV
When a positron and an electron at rest annihilate each other, the sum of

the energies of the gamma rays emitted is 1.02 MeV.
The inverse of annihilation also can occur. That is, energy can be con-
verted directly into matter. If a gamma ray with at least 1.02 MeV of energy

passes close by a nucleus, a positron and electron pair can be produced.
eeThe conversion of energy into a matter-antimatter pair of particles is
called pair production.Individual reactions, such as 
eand e,however, cannot occur, because such events would violate the law of 

conservation of charge. Reactions such as 
eproton also do notoccur; the pair must be a particle and its corresponding antiparticle.
Matter and antimatter particles always come in pairs. 
The productionof a positron-electron pair is shown in 
Figure 30-18.A magnetic fieldaround the bubble chamber causes the oppositely charged particlesÕ tracksto curve in opposite directions. The gamma ray that produced the pair 

produced no track. If the energy of the gamma ray is larger than 1.02 MeV,

the excess energy goes into the kinetic energy of the positron and electron.
The positron soon collides with another electron and they are both anni-
hilated, resulting in the production of two or three gamma rays with a total

energy of no less than 1.02 MeV.
Particle conservation
Each quark and each lepton also has its anti-particle. The antiparticles are identical to the particles except that for
charged particles, an antiparticle will have the opposite charge. For exam-

ple, an up quark, u, has a charge of 
23, while an anti-up quark, u, has acharge of 2
3. A proton, uud, has a charge of 1 and the antiproton, uudd
,has a charge of 2323131. When a particle and its antiparticle collide, they annihilate each other and are transformed into photons, or
lighter particle-antiparticle pairs and energy. The total number of quarks

and the total number of leptons in the universe is constant. That is, quarks

and leptons are created or destroyed only in particle-antiparticle pairs. On

the other hand, force carriers such as gravitons, photons, gluons, and weak

bosons can be created or destroyed if there is enough energy.
Antiprotons also can be created. An antiproton has a mass equal to thatof the proton but is negatively charged. Protons have 1836 times as much

mass as electrons. Thus, the energy needed to create proton-antiproton

pairs is comparably larger. The first proton-antiproton pair was produced

and observed at Berkeley, California in 1955. Neutrons also have an

antiparticle, called an antineutron.

Beta Decay and the Weak Interaction
The high energy electrons emitted in the beta decay of a radioactive
nucleus do not exist in the nucleus. From where do they come? In the
decay process a neutron is transformed into a proton. While in a stable

nucleus, the neutron does not decay. A free neutron, or one in an unstable

nucleus, however, can decay into a proton by emitting a 
particle. Sharing
the outgoing energy with the proton and particle is an antineutrino,00.The antineutrino has a very small mass and is uncharged, but like the 
photon, it carries momentum and energy. The neutron decay equation is
written as follows.

0n10e00The decay of neutrons into protons and protons into neutrons cannot
be explained by the strong force. The existence of beta decay indicates that
there must be another interaction, the weak nuclear force,
acting in thenucleus. This second type of nuclear force is much weaker than the strong

nuclear force.

Figure 30-19
Beta decay of 
a proton to a neutron can be
represented with the quark model:

duW, then We.uddtheneWuudWQuark model of beta decayThe difference between a proton, uud, and a
neutron, udd, is only one quark. Beta decay in the quark model occurs in
two steps, as shown in 
Figure 30-19.First, one d quark in a neutronchanges to a u quark with the emission of a Wboson. The Wboson isone of the three carriers of the weak force. In the second step, the W
boson decays into an electron and an antineutrino. Similarly, in the decay

of a proton, a neutron and a Wboson are emitted. The Wboson thendecays into a positron and a neutrino.
The emission of the third weak force carrier, the Z
0boson, is not accom-panied by a change from one quark to another. The Z
0boson produces aninteraction between the nucleons and the electrons in atoms that is simi-

lar to, but much weaker than, the electromagnetic force holding the atom

together. The interaction first was detected in 1979. The W
, W, and Z0bosons first were observed directly in 1983.
While neutrinos and antineutrinos have long been thought to be massless,
recent experiments that detect neutrinos from the Sun and from distant
accelerators show that neutrinos do have mass, although these masses are

much smaller than those of any other known particles.
Testing the Standard Model
You can see in Figure 30-16 that the quarks and leptons are separated into
three families. The everyday world is made from particles in the left-hand

family: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Particles in the middle group are

found in cosmic rays and are routinely produced in particle accelerators.

Particles in the right-hand family are believed to have existed briefly during

the earliest moments of the Big Bang and are created in high-energy collisions. 
What determines the masses of the quarks and leptons? The Higgsboson, which has been hypothesized as the particle that determines the

masses of the leptons and quarks, has not yet been discovered. The

Standard Model is not a theory; it does not explain the masses of particles,

nor why there are three families of quarks and leptons.
Why are there four forces?
The differences among the four fundamentalinteractions are evident: the forces may act on different quantities such as
charge or mass, they may have different dependencies on distance, and the

force carriers have different properties. There are, however, some similari-

ties among the interactions. For instance, the force between charged 

particles, the electromagnetic interaction, is carried by photons in much

the same way as weak bosons carry the weak interaction. The electric force

acts over a long range because the photon has zero mass, while the weak

force acts over short distances because the W and Z bosons are relatively

massive. The mathematical structures of the theories of the weak interaction

and electromagnetic interaction, however, are similar.

Figure 30-20
In a supernova,the electromagnetic and weakforces are indistinguishable. The

increased light and neutrinos from
supernova 1987A, shown here,

reached Earth at the same time,

demonstrating that neutrinos
travel near the speed of light and
are produced in supernovas, as
predicted. Supernova 1987A is

shown before exploding (a),during explosion (b),and in aclose-up from Hubble(c).Astrophysical theories of supernovae indicate that during massive stellar
explosions, such as the one shown in 
Figure 30-20,
the two interactions
are identical. Present theories of the origin of the universe suggest that the

two forces were identical during the early moments of the cosmos as well.

For this reason, the electromagnetic and weak forces are said to be unified

into a single force, called the electroweak force. 
In the same way that the electromagnetic and weak forces were unified
into the electroweak force during the 1970s, physicists presently are devel-

oping theories that include the strong force as well. Work is still incom-

plete. Theories are being improved, and experiments to test these theories

are being planned. A fully unified theory that includes gravitation will

require even more work.
Even more perplexing are the results of studies of the galaxies that suggest
that matter described by the Standard Model makes up only a small fraction

of the mass in the universe. A much larger amount is formed of dark mat-

ter, so called because it doesnÕt interact with photons or ordinary matter,

except through the gravitational force. In addition, there appears to be dark

energy, an unknown force that accelerates the expansion of the universe.
Thus the studies of the tiniest particles that make up nuclei are connecteddirectly to investigations of the largest systems, the galaxies that make up

the universe. Elementary particle physicists and cosmologists used to be at

opposite ends of the length scale; now they question together ÒWhat IS the

world made of?Ó Perhaps you will be able to answer that question.

Radiation detectors use various means to detect radiation. One common type 
of detector in use is a Geiger-Mueller tube. It consists of a metal tube filled with

gas at a low pressure and a long wire along the tubeÕs axis. The wire is at a high

potential difference, such as 400Ð800 V, relative to the metal tube. At one end of

the tube is a thin, fragile window. When a high-energy photon or charged particle

enters the tube through the window, some of the gas becomes ionized. The ion-

ized electrons are attracted to the wire and speed up. Then they ionize additional
atoms creating a pulse of charge striking the wire. This charge pulse is converted

to a voltage pulse, amplified, and counted or sent to a speaker. 
Previously, you learned that light and other electromagnetic radiation travels in
all directions in straight lines from a source, such as the Sun. In this lab you will

For several decades,
physicists have been
seeking to create and sustain a fusion reactionthat will generate more energy than it consumes.

A thermonuclear reactor would generate great

heat from small amounts of deuterium, 21H,and tritium, 3
1H, which can be extracted fromseawater. 
To initiate a fusion reaction, a mixture of
deuterium and tritium must be heated andcompressed under conditions typical of those
in the Sun. The required temperature would

destroy the sort of containers used in fission

plants. Confining the plasma is one of the

chief design problems for fusion reactors.
Magnetic ConfinementIn a magneticconfinement reactor, a strong current is passed

through a container of deuterium and tritium
gas so that the plasma is compressed within
the arc. Additional magnetic fields shape the

plasma stream, as shown in the diagram, con-

fining it away from the container walls. One

promising configuration keeps the plasma 
in a toroid, or donut shape, which has the

great advantage of having no ends to seal. 
Inertial ConfinementIf you look at the
rapid, string-like motion of a continuous elec-
tric arc, youÕll see that itÕs very difficult to form

plasma into a stable shape. In the inertial con-

finement reactor, a microscopic pellet of frozen

deuterium-tritium is illuminated on all sides
by powerful laser beams. These lasers heat the
outer layer of the pellet so quickly that it

explodes. Simultaneously the remainder of the

pellet is compressed and heated so greatly that
a fusion reaction starts. The energy from the

fusion of the pellet exceeds the energy used to
heat the pellet. A stream of pellets is fused one
after another to obtain a sustained reaction,
and the obtained heat is captured to create
steam for turbines. 
The Future
While thermonuclear fusion has been sustained in both types of reactors,

researchers have had trouble achieving a

breakeven reaction (one in which the energy

produced in the reaction exceeds the energy
needed to sustain the reaction). Progress
toward a practical thermonuclear reactor has

been expensive and slow, but the promise is

great. A fusion reactor is not completely free 
of radiation hazards because neutrons are 
produced in fusion reactions. But because the

fuel itself is not radioactive, the amount 

of nuclear waste would be negligible.

Going Further
Magnetic confinement: the hot plasma is compressed
and confined by the magnetic field.In inertial confinement, beams of light or X rays from 

a laser rapidly heat the surface of the pellet, forming 

a surrounding plasma envelope. The rest of the fuel is

compressed by the blowoff of the hot surface material.

Thesample is then removed and the radiation detector

records 20 counts resulting from cosmic rays in

a function of time. From your graph, determine 

the half-life.

Connecting Math to PhysicsMath is the language of physics. Using math, physicists
are able to describe relationships among the measurements that they make using equa-
tions. Each measurement is associated with a symbol that is used in physics equations.
The symbols are called variables.
Significant DigitsAll measured quantities are approximated and have significant digits. The number 
of significant digits indicates the precision of the measurement. Precision is a measure 

of exactness. The number of significant digits in a measurement depends on the smallest

unit on the measuring tool. The digit farthest to the right in a measurement is estimated.
Example:What is the estimated digit for each of the measuring sticks in the figure below
used to measure the length of the rod?Using the lower measuring tool, the length is between 9 and 10 cm. The measurement
would be estimated to the nearest tenth of 
a centimeter. If the length was exactly on the
9-cm or 10-cm mark, record it as 9.0 cm or 10.0 cm.Using the upper measuring tool, the length is between 9.5 and 9.6 cm. The measurement
would be estimated to the nearest hundredth of a 
centimeter. If 
the length was exactlyon the 9.5-cm or 9.6-cm mark, record it as 9.50 cm or 9.60 cm.

Math Handbook1.State the number of significant digits in each measurement.
a.1405 m
d.12.007 kg
b.2.50 km
e.5.8106kgc.0.0034 m
f.3.03105mLAll nonzero digits in a measurement are signific
ant digits. Some zeros are significant
and some are not. All digits between and 
including the first nonzero digit from the leftthrough the last digit on the right are significant. Use the following rules when determining
the number of significant digits.
1.Nonzero digits are significant.
2.Final zeros after a decimal point are significant.
3.Zeros between two significant digits are significant.
4.Zeros used only as placeholders are not significant.
Example:State the number of significant digits in each measurement.
5.0 g has two significant digits.
Using rules 1 and 214.90 g has four significant digits.
Using rules 1 and 20.0 has one significant digit.
Using rules 2 and 4300.00 mm has five significant digits.
Using rules 1, 2, and 35.06 s has three significant digits.
Using rules 1 and 3304 s has three significant digits.
Using rules 1 and 30.0060 mm has two significant digits (6 and the last 0).
Using rules 1, 2, and 4140 mm has two significant digits (just 1 and 4).
Using rules 1 and 4There are two cases in which numbers are considered exact, and thus, have an 
infinite number of significant digits.
1.Counting numbers have an infinite number of significant digits.
2.Conversion factors have an infinite number of significant digits.
Examples:The factor Ò2Ó in 2
mghas an infinite number.
The number 2 is a counting number. It is an exact integer.
The number Ò4Ó in 4 electrons has an infinite number.
Because you cannot have a partial electron, the number 4, a counting number, 
is considered to have an infinite number of significant digits.
60 s/1 min has an infinite number.
There are exactly 60 seconds in 1 minute, thus there are an infinite number 

of significant digits in the conversion factor.

835RoundingA number can be rounded to a specific place value (like hundreds or tenths) or to 
a specific number of significant digits. To do this, determine the place being rounded,
and then use the following rules.
1.When the leftmost digit to be dropped is less than 5, that digit and any digits that

follow are dropped. Then the last digit in the rounded number remains unchanged.
2.When the leftmost digit to be dropped is greater than 5, that digit and any digits that

follow are dropped, and the last digit in the rounded number is increased by one.3.When the leftmost digit to be dropped is 5 followed by a nonzero number, that digit

and any digits that follow are dropped. The last digit in the rounded number increas-

es by one.
4.If the digit to the right of the last significant digit is equal to 5, and 5 is followed by a

zero or no other digits, look at the last significant digit. If it is odd, increase it by one;

if it is even, do not round up.  Examples:Round the following numbers to the stated number of significant digits.
8.7645 rounded to 3 significant digits is 8.76.
Using rule 18.7676 
rounded to 3 significant digits is 8.77. 
Using rule 28.7519 rounded to 2 significant digits is 8.8.
Using rule 392.350 rounded to 3 significant digits is 92.4.
Using rule 492.25 rounded to 3 significant digits is 92.2.
Using rule 4Operations with Significant Digits
When using a calculator, do all of the operations with as much precision as the 
calculator allows, and then round the result to the correct number of significant digits.

The correct number of significant digits in the result depends on the measurements 

and on the operation.Addition and subtraction
Look at the digits to the right 
of the decimal point. Round the
result to the least precise value among the measurementsÑthe smallest number of digits
to the right of the decimal points.
Example:Add 1.456 m, 4.1 m, and 20.3 m.
The least precise values are 4.1 m and 20.3 m because they have only one digit to the
right of the decimal points.
Add the numbersThe sum is only as precise as the least precise number being added.

ment. Perform the calculation. Round the result so that it has the same number of 
significant digits as the measurement with the least number of significant digits.
Example:Multiply 20.1 m by 3.6 m.(20.1 m)(3.6 m)72.36 m
2The least precise value is 3.6 m with two significant digits. The product can only have 
as many digits as the least precise of the multiplied numbers.

absolute values always are greater than or equal to zero.

A number of the form a10nis written in scientific notation, where 1
a10, and nis an integer. The base, 10, is raised to a power, 
n.The term 
amust be less than 10.
Connecting Math to PhysicsPhysicists use scientific notation to express, compare,
and calculate with measurements that are greater than 10 or less than 1. For example,
the mass of a proton is 
written as 6.731028kg. The density of water is written as
1.000103kg/m3. This shows, 
using significant digit rules, that this measurement is 
exactly 1000 to four significant digits. However, writing the density of water as 1000

kg/m3would imply that it has only one significant digit, which is incorrect. Scientific
notation helps physicists keep accurate track of significant digits.
Large NumbersÑUsing Positive Exponents
Multiplying by a power of 10 is like moving the decimal point that same number of
places to the left (if the power is negative) or 
right (if the power is positive). To express a
large number in scientific notation, 
first determine the value for a, 1a10. Count thenumber of decimal places from the decimal point in 
ato the decimal point in the number.

To express a small number in scientific notation, first determine the value for 
a, 1a10. Then count the number of decimal places from the decimal point in 
ato the decimal point in the number. Use that 
number as the power of 10. Multiplying by a number with a negative power is the same as dividing by that number with the 
corresponding 
positive power.

Adding and subtracting numbers in scientific notation 
is more challenging, because the powers of 10 must be the same in order to add or 
subtract the numbers. This means that one of the numbers may need to be rewritten

with a different power of 10. If the powers of 10 are equal, then use the distributive

Order of Operations
Scientists and mathematicians have agreed on a set of steps or rules, called the
order of operations, so that everyone interprets mathematical symbols in the same way.
Follow these steps in order when you evaluate an expression or use a formula.
1.Simplify the expressions inside grouping symbols, like parentheses ( ), brackets [ ],

braces { }, and fraction bars.
2.Evaluate all powers and roots.
3.Do all multiplications and/or divisions from left to right.
4.Do all additions and/or subtractions from left to right.Example: Simplify the following expression.
43(41)2343(3)23Order of operations step 1
43(3)8Order of operations step 2

8Order of operations step 4
Connecting Math to PhysicsThe previous example was shown step-by-step to
demonstrate order of operations. When solving a physics problem, do not round to the

correct number of siginificant digits until after the final calculation. In calculations involving

an expression in a numerator and an expression in a denominator, the numerator and

the denominator are separate groups and are to be calculated before dividing the

numerator by the denominator. So, the multiplication/division rule is used to determine

the final number of significant digits.

When using the square root property, it is important to consider for what you are

use the negative value of the square root. Also, you need to consider if the negative or
positive value gives you a realistic solution. For example, when using the square root

property to solve for time, a negative value may give you a time before the situation 

even started.

A quadratic equation has the form ax2bxc0, where a0. A quadraticequation has one variable with a power (exponent) of 2. It also may include that same
variable to the first power. The solutions of a quadratic equation can be estimated by

graphing on a graphing calculator. If 
b= 0, then there is no x-term in the quadraticequation. The equation can be solved by isolating the squared variable and finding 

the square root of each side of the equation using the square root property.
Quadratic Formula
The solutions of any quadratic equation can be calculated by using the quadratic
formula. The solutions of 
ax2bxc0, where a0, are given byxb2ab24acLike in the square root property, it is important to consider if the solutions to the
quadratic formula give you a realistic answer to the problem you are solving. Usually, 

you can throw out one of the solutions because it is unrealistic. Projectile motion often

requires the use of the quadratic formula when solving equations, so keep the realism 

of the solution in mind when solving.846Appendix AMath Handbook

The Coordinate Plane
Points are located in reference to two perpendicular number lines, called axes. 
The horizontal number line is called the 
x-axis; the vertical number line is called the 
y-axis. The 
x-axis represents the independent variable. The 
y-axis represents the dependent
variable. A point is represented by two coordinates (
x, y), which also is called an ordered
pair. The value of the independent variable, 
x, always is listed first in the ordered pair.
The ordered pair (0, 0) represents the origin, which is the point where the two axes 
intersect.Graphing Data to Determine a Relationship
Use the following steps to graph data.
1.Draw two perpendicular axes.
2.Identify the independent and the dependent variables. Label each axis using the

variable names.
3.Determine the range of data for each variable. Use the ranges to decide on a conven-

ient scale for each axis. Mark and number the scales.
4.Plot each data point. 
5.When the points seem to lie approximately in a line, draw a Òbest-fitÓ line 
through thepoints. When the points do not lie in a line, draw a smooth curve through as many

data points as possible. When there does not

appear to be a trend or a pattern to the dots, do 

not draw any line or curve.6.Write a title that clearly describes what the

849Math HandbookInterpolating and Extrapolating
Interpolation is a process used to estimate a value for a relation that lies between
two known values. Extrapolation is a process used to estimate a value for a relation 
that lies beyond the known values. The equation of a line through the points (the known

values) helps you interpolate and extrapolate.
Example:Using the data and the graph, estimate the
value, in dollars, of 20 pounds. Use interpolation.Locate two points on either side of 20 poundsÑ
15 pounds and 30 pounds. Draw a line (or place

a straight edge) through the graphed points.

Draw a line segment from 20 on the x-axis tothat line. Draw a line segment from that inter-
section point to the y-axis. Read the scale on the
y-axis. 20 
pounds is about 28 or 29 dollars.Example:Use extrapolation to estimate the value 
of 50 pounds.
Draw a line segment from 50 on 
the x-axis to the line through the points. 
Extend the line if necessary. Read the corresponding value on 

the y-axis. Extend the axis scale if necessary. 
50 pounds is a little more than 70 dollars.
Interpreting Line Graphs
A line graph shows the linear relationship between two variables. Two types 
of line graphs that describe motion are used frequently in physics.

between the two graphed variables.

Math HandbookLinear EquationsA linear equation can be written as a relation (or a function), 
ymxb, where mand bare real numbers, mrepresents the slope of the line, and 
brepresents the 
y-intercept, the point at which the line crosses the 
y-axis.The graph of a linear equation is a line. The line represents all of the solutions of 
the linear equation. To graph a linear equation, choose three values for the independent
variable. (Only two points are needed, 
but the third point serves as a check.) Calculate the
corresponding values 
for the dependent variable. Plot each ordered pair (x, y) as a point.Draw a be
st-fit line through the points.
Example: Graph y12x3Calculate three ordered pairs to obtain points 
to plot.SlopeThe slope of a line is the ratio of the change in 
y-coordinates to the change in 
x-coordinates. It is the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change 
(run). This number tells how steep the line is. It can be a positive or a negative 

number.
To find the slope of aline, select 
two points, (
x1, y1) and (x2, y2).Calculate 
the run, which is the difference (change)
between the two x-coordinates,

If there is some nonzero constant, 
m,such that ymx,then yvaries directly as 
x. That means as the independent variable 
xincreases, the dependent variable 
yincreases.
The variables 
xand yalso are said to be proportional. This is a linear equation of the form
ymxb in which the value of bis zero. The graph passes through the origin, (0, 0).

xis the spring displacement, springforce varies directly as (is proportional 
to) spring displacement. That is, the spring force
increases as the spring displacement increases.
Inverse Variation
If there is some nonzero constant, 
m,such that ymx, then yvaries inversely as 
x.That means as the independent variable 
xincreases, the dependent variable 
ydecreases.
The variables 
xand yalso are said to be inversely proportional. This is not a linear equation
because it contains the product of two variables. The graph of an inverse relationship is
a hyperbola. This relationship can be written as

can be used to purify a sample of mixed
uranium-235 and uranium-238 isotopes.

Assume that B5.00103T, 
V55.0 V,
and that each uranium isotope has a 5ionization state. Uranium-235 has a mass

that is 235 times that of a proton, while
uranium-238 has a mass that is 238 times
that of a proton. By what distance will the
two isotopes be separated by the mass

spectrometer?8.A mass spectrometer often is used in car-
bon dating to determine the ratio of C-14
isotopes to C-12 isotopes in a biological
sample. This ratio then is used to estimate

how long ago the once-living organism

died. Because a mass spectrometer is sensi-
tive to the charge-to-mass ratio, it is possi-

ble for a contaminant particle to alter the
value measured for the C-14/C-12 ratio,

and thus, yield erroneous results. When

ionized, C-14 forms an ion with a 4charge, and the mass of C-14 is 14 times

that of a proton. Consider a contaminant
