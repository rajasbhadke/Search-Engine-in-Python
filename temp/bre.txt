Rules for joining the BRE league within GENERIC NET.

1) You must be a member of Generic Net (obvious ehh) and you must also
   have at least the required echo(s) installed and active. 

2) Your BRE game must be set insuring the following items prior to being
   assigned a planet number, etc..
    
     a) In your drop file from your respective menus that start
        BRE, make sure that the REAL NAME is passed to the game,
        NOT THE ALIAS. The game allows all of us to name our realms
        as we choose, so the real name is not known to anyone else.
        What this will do is prevent players logging onto different
        boards in the league under different alias's. Set 
        CHECKDUPES to TRUE in your Resource.dat file. 

     b) Run BRE PLANETARY whenever you receive mail, Not just once
        per day, or several days..... 

     c) Everyone needs to change their respective Ipdata.cfg files
        so that mail IS NOT ROUTED, but CRASH MAILED to everyone.
        Just comment out the route statement and include the
        statement CRASH * ..... This way everything should come
        direct from one board to another.  The only exception that 
        will be made to crashing the packets will be in the event
        you are a long distance  node (L.D.from your BRE hub).
        If this is the case, mail will be routed to that nodes hub 
        so that the node can poll his/her hub for Bre packets. This
        must be done a MINIMUM of once every 24 hours.


Check with your BRE hub or Generic Net hedquarters (555:555/0) for reset
parameters, current game version, and other nec. information...
