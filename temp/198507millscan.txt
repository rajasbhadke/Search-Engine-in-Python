Hi there, Lazer Disk here, here's some Bond Trivia to answer!

   o Who produces the Bond "flicks"?

   o Who directed "A View to a Kill"

   o In the new John Gardner James Bond book, "Role of Honor"
     what was the name of the computer Bond used?

   o In the earlier Bond books and movies, what was Bond's 
     favourite cigarette and drink?

   o How was Jaws killed?

   o What woman played in two Bond films, exactly 10 years 
     apart from one another?

   o In Octopussy, when 009 (wearing a clown suit) was being 
     chased, what color balloon was he carrying?

Good luck to ANYONE who can get all <00>7 of them!
By the way, I'm a friend of The Slipped Disk. He's dragging 
alot of his friends onto the board.

                Yes ... the Thunderclock will be here for a while ...
at least until TM and MIO return. I really like it ... and it limits the 
time the leeches can leech the system!

  I agree Bofe has hit rock botttom, The mistyake you made though was tellin 
g them werte you went so now they will probably follow you here.
Enough of that.

Bush, would he make a good president? I can't really tell I was young when he 
was head of the CIA. Then he became Vice President and has had little chance 
to do anything since then. The only way we will know is if he has to take 
office. In which case Let us hope it is only for a year. Then we can evaluate 
what he has done then vote. Another possibility for Republican candidant (sp)
is Kemp. How many of you remember seeing the Kemp '88 signs at the rallies 
for regan?
                                   Nothing great,

...but I gotta calm down for just a bit...

...upon hearing that those kids got busted, I got a call not three hours 
later, and to my dismay it was one of the dudes that got busted (a personal 
friend...) - at either rate, he'd already warned me that I was NOW *ninth* 
on the list as a target in Central Jersey...I rattled off about twenty quick 
handles and he couldn't place any of them in the near future, which means 
that just about every other 2001 member is safe as far as South/Central 
Jersey goes...

...nonetheless, I'm gonna haftta pull out for quite a while...I realise that 
I have put nothing here in the name of hacks or phreaks, but those who 
know me know I produce when necessary...

...just to tell you that I'm still in business tho, when September rolls 
around I'll begin polling people to see who's worthy of receiving a 
Princeton VAX System PW...I've discovered that any legit System PW on the 
VAX in Princeton will work on Rutgers, Rider, TSC, NJIT and a few others...

...anyone who does me right in the next few months will receive so...i'm not 
gonna ask for anything, just keep in mind that I may need to get my own ass 
out of some deep shit soon, and I'll need some backing...

Take it light...[><]...
(And let's be CAREFUL out there!)

Wait a second vig, it wasn't the Pirate's Chest, it was the Treasure Chest, 
The Hack Shack, The Vampire BBS, and Private Sector.

I saw them on various news programs last night. It's a pretty sick way to see 
what a board looks like.

I'm personallly interested in this story because my name, address,
and phone # were on the Private Sector. Luckily, I listed my non-data line as 
my number, but just to be sure, I'm not going to use that line for anything 
illegal (discussion or otherwise) because I believe that I have a pen register 
on that line.

Slipped Disk..

There were what..200 users on private sector??

They couldn't put pin registers on everyones lines.. Prob. just the people th 
at they saw real nasty posts by..
(assumming you WEREN'T one of the biggest posters..)

Does anybody know what the last bioc realesed was.. I have gotten different 
stories..
it seems to be between 7 and 9.. but the person saying 7 is reliable.. 
anyone know the COMPLETE story?
And, if they went to the trouble to put a pin register on ONE line.. 
they probably could easily find out your OTHER line.. if they want to,
at least.. But, as far as I know.. you shouldn't worry about typing no-no 
stuff onto boards on either line, because if they start to minitor it,
they can't use carriers as evidence, even if they know what id being typed, 
they are too easy to fake..

at least *I* wasn't on ANY of those..
