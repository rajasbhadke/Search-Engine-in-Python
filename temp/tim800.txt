                    rude and often suspends accounts for no reason.  The

                    disk online is Night Owl version six.  The message

FEATURES............MLink BBS is a superb single line bulletin board system.
                    It is very well maintained and includes a large message
                    area as well as many popular online games.  The Sysop
                    of the system is very friendly and personally calls
                    new users for verification.  The finest feature of the
                    service is the FREE Internet/UseNET access provided
                    to all users as NO CHARGE.  It also sports a generous
                    file area.
COMMENTS............800 BBS of the Month [June] - This is an excellent BBS
                    which rises above all others.  It is FREE and very 
                    professional looking.  The SYSOP of the bulletin board
                    is also very nice.  I was greeted with a friendly voice
                    when I picked up the phone on his verification call and
                    it made urge to call back.  And of course, the Internet
                    access is terrific.  It may soon be a support BBS for
                    The Iron Maiden National 800 List.
