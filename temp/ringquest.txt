Ring Quest (Pictire-Text Adventure)
Compatible: 64k Apple II+, //e
Requirements: One disk drive

     The Ring of Chaos has enslaved the noble sorceress, Lisa, and all space-time is threatened by its destructive influence. As bearer of the Ring of Order, your mission is to free Lisa before reality is disrupted beyond retrieval.

     Nominal sequel of The Quest, Ring Quest returns you to the magical land of Balema, accompanied once more by Gorn, your water-swilling strong-arm. Far to the north is your ultimate goal, the sorceress's mountain  citadel. As though its shield of green lightning were not adequate, you soon encounter other obstacles, including trolls, manticoras, amorous ogresses, and greedy seers.

     Good mapping is amply rewarded in this adventure, where Lisa is liable to pop in at any moment to cast a teleport spell, bewitch Gorn into confusion (hard to detect), or dry up your water supply.

     Offering decent graphics, two (optional) arcade sequences, and one of the more creative scene-setter booklets, "Ring Quest" is a moderately challenging, fun to play collection of puzzles. Though experienced adventurers will cut through this one like a piece of cheese, the game is well suited to beginners.
