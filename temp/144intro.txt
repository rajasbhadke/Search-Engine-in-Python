 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 WHAT THIS IS:

 - The 144BBS List is a collection of numbers reported as belonging to
   US BBSes with one or more lines supporting v.32, v.32bis, v.fast
   class and v.34 CONNECTs.
 - 144BBS List is compiled and maintained by Ken Sukimoto, SysOp of the
   DownTown BBS as a service to DownTown BBS subscribers and other
   callers and is published on an irregular basis although we try to
   have a new release on the first of each month.
 - 144BBS List is also available as a comma delimited file for those of
   you using BBS doors for online display and/or in need of info for
   database applications. This file is distributed as 144BBS.DB.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 WHAT THIS ISN'T:

 - This is not intended to be an advertising list. With the way BBS's
   change, there is no way I or most anyone else could keep up with
   software/hardware changes, doorways added/deleted, specialties of the
   BBS and other features that make a BBS unique. This would also make
   144BBS even larger than it currently is and just one more opportunity
   to be inaccurate.
 - Although it is the goal, 144BBS is not comprehensive. I am quite sure
   there are a lot of BBS's that have been omitted - rather than attempt
   to guess at BBS names/numbers/cities and modem types, I am depending
   on reliable sources to submit these missing BBS's and accurate
   information about them.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 COPYRIGHT AND DISTRIBUTION:

 - Since the content of 144BBS is for the most part public knowledge, no
   formal copyright for content is applied for.
 - I'm not even sure that the name "144BBS" isn't already copyrighted;
   if it isn't, then that is the only copyright claimed.
 - Rather than legalese and restrictions, I request common courtesy in
   the distribution of 144BBS List.
 - No fee should be charged for 144BBS List other than normal system
   access requirements.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

 - 144BBS List is dedicated to the SysOps who install high speed modems,
   enabling users to access systems at higher and higher speeds. It is
   also dedicated to these same users who motivated the SysOps to
   install these modems through their contributions; material,
   inspirational and otherwise.
 - Thanks go to the SysOps, Users and Administrators of U'NI Net,
   SmartNet, MajorNet and Intelec for their help and the use of their
   networks to gather information for this list.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 NAMING CONVENTION & MISCELLANEA:

 - When distributing this list, do not rename 144BBS.DB or 144BBS.TXT!
 - Most BBSes don't like unarchived text files, so if archived, name the
   archive "144DB-a#.ext" or "144BBSa#" where:
    a  = alpha designator - A=Jan; B=Feb; C=Mar; L=Dec
    #  = the last number of the year; 1994 = 4, 19955 = 5
   ext = whatever extension the archiving program defaults to.
   The December, 1994 release will be named 144BBSL4.ZIP (using PKZIP to
   archive) as an example of the naming convention.
 - Please note - many systems listed are multi-line or multi-node and
   their inclusion on this list does not mean the number listed has that
   particular setup available. Some BBSes are subscription and reserve
   the high speed lines for subscribers only.
 - The 144BBS archives on The DownTown BBS and those directly uploaded
   by KEN SUKIMOTO are archived using the PKZIP -AV authencity
   validation option. When extracted, the -AV information should display
   The Downtown BBS name and the # AIN871 registration.
 - The DownTown BBS is currently a 6 line MajorBBS system with access on
   your first call to download 144BBS. See the file 144PICK.UP for the
   procedure.
