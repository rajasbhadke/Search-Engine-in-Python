A Song for the Spanish Anarchists

by Herbert Read

(From Thirty-five Poems, 1940)

The golden lemon is not mase
but grows on a green tree:
A strong man and his crystal eyes
is a man born free.

The oxen pass under the yoke
and the blind are led at will:
But a man born free has a path of his own
and a house on the hill.

An men are men who till the land
and women are women who weave
Fifty men own the lemon grove
and no man is a slave.
