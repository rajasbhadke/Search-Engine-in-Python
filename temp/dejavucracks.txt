DejaVu Cracks


Here are a couple Deju Vu cracks from Computist magazine. 
The first one must be credited to Schwarz Adler
and Dan Halfwit.
 
1. Search a copy for the bytes 22 E1 EA 00 B0 07 22 90 E8 00 20 D3 EA.
   They will probably be at block $076, byte $9A.  Replace the first 6
   bytes with AF EA EA EA 80 07.
2. Search for CD BB BE F0 08 A9.  You should find it 6 times.  Each F0
   must be changed to 80.
3. Search for 55 E7 70 CD BB BE D0 6B FF 00.  Probably at block $0027,
   byte $1ED.  Change the 70 and the 6B both to 00.
 
Or block edit these bytes on a copy to $80.  This should let you put it
on your hard drive.
 
block    byte
$00D     $05C
$00E     $15A
$023     $149
$024     $039
$024     $0B4
$024     $190
 

Email me if neither of these work for you.
