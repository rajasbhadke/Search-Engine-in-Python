Wizardry IV Codes


I. File: Wiz4CodesProgram.zip

Wiz4code is a QBASIC program which
accepts the 12-digit "Mordor Card"
codes and returns the correct 4-digit
code needed to continue play.

This program can be run in a separate window
while the AppleWin A2 emulator is running.
I tried starting it while AppleWin was
running a game-- it worked fine and the
game continued running on AppleWin.


To use, unZip using WinZip. You will get a
folder which includes the QBASIC program,
a Readme text file, and other stuff to run
the program.

Follow directions in the Readme file.



II. File: WIZ4CODES.DSK

This is the Wiz4code program in Applesoft
on a bootable ProDOS disk image.

The idea was that the dsk could be booted
on AppleWin started up after AppleWin had
been started up to run Wizardry IV-- i.e.
you would have two AppleWins running at
once and be able to use one to give you 
the codes.

It does not work for 2 AppleWins. (AppleWin
bombs.) It _may_ work if some other A2
emulator is started-- i.e. you run Wiz IV
under AppleWin and boot the dsk on some
other A2 emu program.

Of course, the .dsk file can be transferred
to a real Apple II, converted to diskette
form using DSK2FILE or ASIMOV and booted on
an Apple II. You could get code answers from
your Apple II while playing Wizardry IV on
your PC or Mac A2 emulator.



III. Wizardry IV Codes List

This is the list of codes produced by 
Bob Colbert and printed in Computist
along with directions for using the list.

If you do not mind pencil and paper
figuring, you can use this list.

The Mordor Charge Card number in the
questions consists on three 4-digit
numbers for a total of 12 digits
such as ...

2338-1753-2451


What you do is find the three 4-digit
code numbers (Code #1, Code #2, and
Code #3) in the Left side of each
column. In each case, you jot down
the associated number in the Right side
of the column. This gives you three new
4-digit numbers.

Example:

In Code #1 Col:  2338 -->   6375
In Code #2 Col:  1753 -->   6704
In Code #3 Col:  2451 -->   8981

(The example codes are marked with an *
 in the list.)


Next, you add the three new numbers.

  6375
  6704
  8981
+______

 22060

If the result has more than 4 digits,
you subtract 9000. If this result has
more than 4 digits, you subtract 9000
again-- you keep subtracting 9000 until
you get just 4 digits.

The 4-digit result of all this is the
code you need to enter.

In the example, you need to subtract 9000
from 22060 twice to get a 4-digit number.

What you get is 4060. This is the
code you would need to type in.
