COLD PESTO SAUCE

1/4 cup nuts - pine, walnut, almond - white meat nut?
1 bunch of basil
1 head of garlic
3-5 lbs. of tomatoes
Salt
Olive oil
large pasta - rigatoni, linguini, ziti, percatelli (#15)

Prepare in large bowl
- mince garlic (very fine)
- crush nuts
- chop up basil (very fine)
- cut tomatoes (small pieces)
- a dash of salt
- a pour of oil

Let chill overnight-the food combines and breaks down into a sauce. Cook
pasta-you want a larger noodle so that it retains heat when you pour the
cold sauce on hot nnodles-it is perfect temperature to eat.
