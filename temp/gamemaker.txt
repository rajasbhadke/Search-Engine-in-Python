 Authors note:  This file is a very-much abridged version of the Game Maker 
docs - Most of the important stuff is here, without the "computer illiterate"
garbage... i.e. "to boot: insert disk in drive with label up.. close drive 
door.. turn computer on" etc.. Have fun...

Gamemaker is made up of 5 separate parts.  1) The Scene Maker, which lets you
draw background scenes for the games  2) The Sprite Maker, which lets you 
create characters  3) The Sound Maker for sound effects  4) The Music Maker,
for background music, and 5) The Gamemaker Editor, which ties them all 
together.

          The Gamemaker Editor

Main Commands: 

Menu (back to main menu)
File (Load, Save, Init, Delete)
Make a Disk (write the game to disk)
Prnt (prints out listing of game)
Clr  (clears program area)
Run  (run the program in program area)
Ins  (insert blank line at cursor)
Del  (delete line at cursor)
Find (places cursor next to given label)
Copy (copies chunks of program)
Move (move lines around)

   Watch the Message line at the top for questions and comments... (i.e. Delete
 (y/n) ? )

  The Command window (in the middle) displays all of the commands available to
you when programming.  The list can be scrolled forward and backwards, and the
window itself can be expanded (using the 'tab' at the bottom right corner)

 To place a command, place the cursor in the programming area (bottom) where 
you want the command to go, and press the button or space bar.
  Next, scroll through the command list until you find the command you want, 
and hit the button.  The command will be copied into the program area.

    The Program area (at the bottom) like the Command area, can be scrolled up
and down (by pushing the button while the cursor is on the up or down arrows).
 You can change the information in the program area, select the line you want
to change, go to the command box and select the new command, and hit the 
button. 

             The Scene Maker

The Scene Maker has 4 sub-parts.  The Scene Maker Commands, The Scene Maker 
Paint Box, the Drawing Modes, and the Drawing Board.

  Scene Maker Commands:

  File (see previous section for file commands)
  Quit (back to editor)
  Undo (undo last operation)
  Clear (clears the drawing board)

  The Paint Box:

  To choose a color, move the cursor onto the respective color, and hit the
button.

  The Drawing Modes:

  Draw (Free drawing)
  Circl (draws circles - set the center and radius)
  Line (between 2 points)
  Box  (2 points)
  Fill
  Zoom (magnifies area)
  Copy (cut & paste)
  View (hides the commands to view full screen)
  Move

  You can erase parts already done by drawing over with a different color, or
eliminating the dots one-by-one in the Zoom mode.

             The Sprite Maker

  In the Sprite Maker, you have 3 sections:

Sprite Maker Commands
Sprite Drawing board (where you draw the sprites)
Sprite Positioning Area (where you position the different sprite pictures when
making an animated character)

   In the command area are 6 commands - Quit (exit to main), File, Setup (to
start new sprites), FR (frame #, for animated sprits), SPR (sprite #), and Cmd
(editing commands - flip, animate, shift, quit, clear, copy)

To start a new sprite:  First, go to Setup, and select how many small sprites
are going to make up one whole shape ('sprites' command).  Then you will be
asked to "position" your sprites, which means to place the component sprites on
the sprite positioning area, in the order that they make up the large sprite.
Next, select the color that you want to draw with (by moving to color & hitting
the button twice), then move to the Drawing Board, and place the dots in the 
order you want.  If you are drawing more than one sprite, go to the "SP=1" box
and move the joystick to change it to "SP=2", and so on until you are finished.
If you are animating a sprite, you use the "FR=1" box (frame=1), to select 
another frame, and re-draw the sprites.

Sprite Editing Commands: ("cmd" box)


Flip:  Turns the sprite in the direction indicated
Anim:  Animates the sprite from Frame x to Frame y.  Button stops the viewing.
Shift: Moves the graphics in the area of the current frame.
Quit:  Exits to previous commands
Clear: Erase the entire sprite
Copy:  To copy frames from sprite to sprite.

             Sound Maker

There are three sections to Sound Maker - the Sound Maker Commands, the Knobs,
and the Slides.

The Commands:

Save, Load, Init
Quit (exits to main)
Delete (deletes current frame)
Insert (inserts frame)
Copy  (copies sounds from frame to frame)
Clear (clears the entire screen)

Knobs:  To move a knob, press the button while on the knob, then move joystick
 until it has the correct setting you want.

Reps:  Will repeat sounds (you must also set the Number of times to repeat, and
      the Delay between reps)
Frm:  Indicates which frame you are working on (1-63)
Wave: Chooses between 3 different sound types- Slide, Pulse, or Noise (turn the
      Pulse knob to change pulse)
Frq:  Frequency (pitch) of sound
Spd (knob): Speed of sweep

Sliders:  (push button on, and move it up and down)

Spd: Speed of sound
Dur: Duration of sounds

Other commands:

Hear Sound: Plays whole sound effect
Hear Frame: Plays selected frames
Constant: Repeats sound or frame until turned off
Quiet (or ESC): Stops playing 
             Music Maker

Commands:

File
Quit
Insert  (use arrows to move to note to insert before)
Del     (use arrows to select note to delete)
Top    (takes you to beginning of music)
Play   (playes music)
Clr    (clears all notes)
Stop   (ceases playing song, CONT continues)

To enter a note:  Put marker in note selection box, and hit the button.  Move
joystick until the note you want is in the box, then hit the button.  Move the
pointer onto the music sheet and hit the button.  

Channels-  there are two different voices that can play at once, one on the top
staff, one on the bottom.  When selecting a note, it is specifically for one
channel or the other (depending on wether it is red or blue, which can be
changed by moving the joystick).  To change the channel, select it with the
pointer.

Instruments- There are many different instruments which can be played, to
select a different one, move the pointer down to the box (right next to the
channels) and select which instrument you want.

Tie:  To tie together notes, to smooth out the music.  

Tempo:  (speed of music) Can be set on slow, med, fast.
