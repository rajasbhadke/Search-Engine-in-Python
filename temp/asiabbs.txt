    *** The original list was created by Yukio Iura, Tokyo, in April, 1989 ***
    *** The list was significantly enlarged by Yoshi Mikami in Dec., 1989 ***

WHAT'S NEW IN THE BBSdom IN GREATER TOKYO:

 1. Effective March, 1990, NTT reduced the telephone charges by approximately
    30 percent.  The night time rate (11:00pm-8:00am) of local calls, for
    example, is now 10 yen per 4 minutes, vs. 10 yen per 3 minutes for the day
    time rate (8:00am-11:00pm).  KDD also reduced  our overseas telephone
    charges by about 30 percent.

 2. VBBS, a new BBS host program made by Ray Penas, Yokohama, is running on    The Sanko Mall, Art Balfour, Sysop.  It's a bilingual BBS.

 3. T. "Teddy" Matsumoto, Tokyo, donated LHEXE Version 1.50 to public domain
    in February, 1990.  It unarchives the files in *.LZH storage (archived by
    H. "Yoshi" Yoshizaki's LHarc) into memory and executes them.  The "Dynabook
    generation", who started to carry their notebook PCs such as Dynabook
    (Toshiba J3100SS) or On-Line Note (IBM 5499) with limited physical and VRAM
    disk space from September 1989, should find it extremely helpful.


                       LEGEND:

ACCESS <a> is the access information:
     = Open access
   D = Open access, but validation delay for full access
   R = Registration required; Extended access available
   $ = Registration & payment required

MAXIMUM LINE SPEED <b> is the line speed code in bits per second:
   3 = 300    12 = 1200    24 = 2400
  96 = 9600  144 = 14400  192 = 19200MODEMS <c> is the modem code:
   Mn= MNP Class n (Microcom, Aiwa, Omron, NEC, Fujitsu, IBM, etc.)
   V4= V.42 (Hayes 9600 and 19200 V.42, Aiwa 2400 V.42, Omron 2400 V.42, etc.)
       /Should also be able to connect to MNP 1-4 modems/
   F = FastComm 9600
   U = U.S. Robotics 9600 HST or Dual HST/V.32-MNP5
   T = Telebit Trailblazer or Trailblazer Plus
   V3= (USR V.32-MNP5, Aiwa 9600 V.32-MNP4, Omron 9600 V.32-MNP5, etc.)

VERIFICATION <v> of systems:
   V = Verified
   B = Busy
   - = No answer
   ! = No answer; apparently closed.  To be deleted in the next revision.
   # = New BBS or phone number

TERMINAL PARAMETERS:
      All systems are 8-N-1 (i.e., 8 data bits, no parity bit, 1 stop bit),
      unless (7-E-1) is seen, then set up for 7 data bits and even parity.

HOURS:
      All systems are on 24hrs/day, unless note mentions otherwise.      W/D = Weekdays.   W/E =  Weekends (Saturday, Sunday & Local Holiday)
      W/N = Weekday Nights (approximately, 10:00pm to 7:00am)

NOTES:
    - 7-bit NetMail was started by Tom Jenning's Fido BBS, using 7-bit data
      in the 8-bit frame.  EchoMail is used to exchange bulk messages between
      two nodes.  International NetMail started in January, 1990, on MCN and
      other Fido nodes, with Tokyo (Net 730) defined as part of Far East
      (Region 57) in Western Pacific (Zone 3) under the control of Sydney,
      Australia.  8-bit NetMail is exchanged in Taiwan and Japan only.

    - 8-bit NetMail is exchanged by the BBS's shown by Net xx/y of the above
      list, at 10:45-11:00pm.  It transmits the full 8-bit information (double-
      byte Japanese JISCII characters as well as the 256 8-bit single-byte
      English ASCII characters) over NetMail, not just the 128 7-bit ASCII
      characters as in the Fido or Phoenix NetMail in U.S.  The oversight
      of Phoenix 1.07 of treating ASCII code 227 (hexadecimal E3, Greek pi)
      as end-of-text character in the Message areas (which causes the double-
      byte Japanese characters to split into two single-byte characters in two
      lines) and masking/unmasking NetMail messages to pass only the 7-bit
      information in the 8-bit NetMail (which makes it impossible to send full
      8-bit-based Japanese characters in NetMail) was corrected in August, 1988,      by the so-called "E3 Patch" by Fumio Matsuura, Shinza City.

    Some extremist Sysops in Japan call FidoNet "intolerable" because it denies
    the freedom of speech in the languages written in the characters other than
    the American English alphabet (ASCII codes 1-128), in a way similar to how
    the young Mme. Marie Joliot-Curie was denied to speak her native Polish
    language under the Russian occupation of Poland, and because this situation
    is extremely harsh against the "double-byte" languages of Chinese, Japanese
    and Korean, which are expressed in two sequential characters in ASCII codes
    129-256.  But, a more accurate statement of this subject would be that the
    FidoNet and the FidoNet compatible people networks do have an inherent
    ability to handle this new requirement and that they should start allowing
    transmission of full 8-bit information.  The 8-bit Chinese and Japanese
    message transmissions already started in Taiwan and Japan.

    The problem stated above was discussed by a group of Japanese Sysops with
    the attendees of the RBBS-PC Conference that was held in U.S. in October,
    1988, in a well documented paper (BBSML3.ZIP - "Multi-lingual Requiremnts
    to the BBS Host Programs Made in U.S.").  Unless we manage it carefully,
    it will become another explosive issue in the Japan-U.S.-Europe
    relationship of the 1990s because the Japanese networks will start throwing
    in 8-bit information to the 7-bit based networks in U.S., resulting in    chaos everywhere.

To foster international communication, the legend has been changed to the one
similar to that of "THE ATLANTA BULLETIN BOARD LIST Revision #22" (Copyright
(c) 1989 by OAS, Inc., a non-profit organization of the Atlanta area sysops).
A warm welcome to Shuichi Fujita by OAS at their October, 1989, meeting was
much appreciated.  The Line Speed codes in the OAS list have been made more
"generic" in this list and a few codes have been added.


                 SOME TIPS ON BBSING IN JAPAN

Your modem, say, from U.S., supporting Bell 212A at 1200bps and CCITT V.22bis
at 2400bps, would technically work in Japan, because most BBS host modems here
entertain all protocols: Bell 103/CCITT V.21 at 300bps, Bell 212A/CCITT V.22
at 1200bps and CCITT V.22bis at 2400bps.  Legally, however, you must use in
Japan, like in any other country of the world, a modem authorized by the
industry-wide organizations of that country (JATE and VCCI), for compliance to
the telecommunications, electro-magnetic interference and other laws.  Yes, the
U.S. Robotics 9600 HST modem has its own devotees here; the modems with MNP
(Microcom Networking Protocol) are quite often used; and many Sysop are now
deciding if the new V.42 (2400 bps, MNP4), V42bis (2400 bps, MNP5) and V.32(9600 bps) modems would give any benefits.

Wall outlets for telephone attachment, hitherto mostly hard-wired, are quickly
being converted to the U.S.-type "modular plugs" (RJ11), for easier attachment
of the new, fancier, more expensive telephone sets or modems.  (NTT's 3-prong
telephone plugs never became popular.)  Conversion kits to the modular plugs
are sold at the local radio shops ("denki-ya" in Japanese) or large retail
stores.

We use 100 Volts/50 Hertz in eastern Japan (in Tokyo) and 100V/60Hz in western
Japan (in Nagoya and Osaka), with the actual boundary being on the Fuji River
that flows a little west of Mt. Fuji.  This electric cycle difference should
not bother you because no modern personal computer equipment is made sensitive
to the electric cycle.  (Electric shavers and refrigerators are sensitive.)
The 240/120-to-100 stepdown transformers can be bought at the souvenir shops
of the Tokyo City Air Terminal (TCAT) at Hakozaki-cho, or at the transformer
shops of the Akihabara, Tokyo, and Edison Plaza, Yokohama, districts, for
3-6,000 yen.  Choose the transformers with right wattage capacity: up to 20W for
recharging the battery of your laptop, 50W for your AC-powered laptop or
Japanese "word processors," and 400-1,000W for your personal computer systems.
We use the U.S.-type 2-flat blade plugs on electric outlet on the wall.  The
third round earth pin is used on the plugs in business offices, but rarely usedon the wall outlets in the homes.  3-prong-to-2-prong converter plugs can be
easily bought at the transformer shops if your machine is equipped with the
3-prong pw
Fo information about the BBS's outside of the Greater Tokyo area, contact
in Nagoya City FPUC BBS (Foreign PC User Club) 0563-57-0914 (Toshi Omi, Sysop;
Net 70/1) and in the Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe area MacRadyo 06-765-9680, Aegis BBS
075-954-0118 or Kerry Reuter's BBS (Kansai IBM PC User Group) 0727-66-4410.
They should be able to tell you of more BBS's in their respective areas.

Aside from these BBS's, there are over 700 other BBS's in Japan which are
operated in the Japanese language, according to the BBS Denwacho published
quarterly by Dempa Shimbun-sha (Phone: 03-445-6111) and the BBS directory
included in the "NETWORKER" magazine published quarterly by ASCII Corp., both
available in the local bookstores.  Their computer talks are mostly on NEC 9801
and its clone from Epson which are the dominant personal computers here in
homes and in medium-sized and small businesses.  Toshiba J3100/DynaBook, Apple
Macintosh as used in the Japanese mode, Fujitsu (FMR and TOWNS), IBM (5550,
PS/55 and JX) and AX machines from various companies are also often discussed.
The Japanese characters on your IBM PC would look like full of the special
characters in positions 129-256 of the 8-bit 256-character ASCII code table.Commercial networks with many access points all over Japan, some of them in
special relationship to the U.S.-based networks, are also available.  Contact:

When calling Japan from overseas directly over the telephone network, set your
modem with ATS7=60 to allow the modem to wait 60 seconds after dialing for
carrier detect.  Otherwise, your Hayes compatible modem at default setting will
disconnect after 30 seconds and display a "No Carrier" message, leaving not
enough time for your modem to detect the carrier signal being transmitted across
the Pacific Ocean over the satellite link from the BBS host modem in Japan."PC-Pursuit" and "Starlink" are the services offered in U.S. by Telenet, a U.S.
Sprint subsidiary, and by TYMNET, a British Telecom subsidiary, respectively,
allowing the Telenet/TYMNET users to call in a local Telenet/TYMNET port and to
"remotely" dial up any BBS in the region where such services are offered.
If you are traveling in Japan and want to use PC-Pursuit, use the Telenet ports
in Japan such as 03-794-6381 in Tokyo or 06-365-9188 in Osaka (1200/2400/MNP5)
or contact Telenet Japan, Inc. (Tomoko Furukawa, 03-794-6602).  For Starlink,
call the TYMPAS numbers listed above.

A service similar to PC-Pursuit/Starlink is offered as TYMPAS 777 service by
NIS, a TYMNET affiliate in Japan.  As a user, you can call anyone of the
TYMPAS ports in Japan, key in I at the terminal identifier: prompt and USER-ID;
777;PASSWORD at the please log in: prompt and continue to select from the menus
till you reach, for example, B&B Shimokitazawa.  You can call B&B Shimokitazawa
through TYMNET ports overseas, such as 312-922-6571 in Chicago, 213-578-7514
in L.A., 212-809-9660 in N.Y.C., 3-735-3623 in Hong Kong, 2-906-3473 in Sydney,
3-820-9088 in Melbourne, etc.  You would need to key in O at the terminal
identifier prompt, NISJPN at the please log in: prompt, and USER-ID:777;
PASSWORD at the second please log in: prompt.  Travelling other countries in
Asia, you will find the countries like Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand where
telecommunications is still under the governments' tight control and you must
first get a local company's service, such as, in Taiwan, PACNET from DataCommunications Institute (886-2-344-3117) or UDAS from International Telecom-
munications Administration (886-2-344-3770), and then pass through to TYMPAS by
specifying the DTE address of 44082100010.

Continuing to use TYMPAS as an example, you can call CompuServe from a TYMPAS
port in Japan.  Set your term program to 7-E-1 and type A for the terminal
identifier and USER-ID;3106001133;PASSWORD for TYMPAS service, and then the
regular CIS/user-id/password sequence for CompuServe.  CompuServe, of course,
can be accessed in a variety of ways, such as via NIFTY-Serve or Venus-P.
Yes, TAPCIS (a shareware program) for IBMPC and Navigator (a commercial
program) for Macintosh are used frequently here too, for easier on-line
navigation on CompuServe.

If your are a UNIX or AIX fan and would rather talk about System V, 4.3BSD,
Mach, uucp or OSF/1, rather than the MS-DOS based subjects, my recommendation
for you is to write to:

     Yoh Hitomi, juice administration offce
     c/o J.M.A. Systems Co., Ltd., Nihon Seimei Minami-Azabu Bldg.
     8-12, Minami-Azabu 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo  106

juice (Japan Un*x I* Communication Environment) is a volunteer-operated, UNIX-based, personal communications network in Japan with approximately 30 sites.
You'll meet there the nice people like Norihiro Mita, the UNIX guru.  It is
connected through a gateway to JUNET, a Japanese network of about 300 sites
including major universities and corporations, and through another gate way to
USENET in U.S.  If your interest by the way is in the academic world,
regardless of MS-DOS or UNIX, there are BITNET nodes in Japan, too.  The
contact point of BITNET here is Tokyo Science University (Tokyo Rika Daigaku).

The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications's consultative committee recommeded
in March 1990 to split the giant NTT corporation in 1995 into three entities:
the local access, long distance and mobile communications companies.  (The
further split of the local access company, as in the case of AT&T in U.S., was
not in the recommendation.)  While the Ministry of Finance (which still holds
the majority of NTT's shares) insists on a delay of the split decision till
1995 because of the recent nosedive of the NTT share price and the national
debate continues, NTT itself is in the midst of their ISDN (Integrated Services
Digital Network) implementation.  Their INS (Information Network Service) Net
64 provides two 64K bps data channels and one 16K bps control signal channel
(2B+D) on the existing copper wire and started in the capital cities of Japan's
48 prefectures in 1988.  INS Net 1500 use optical fibers to serve 23B+D
channels since 1989 and, if legally allowed, can provide movie channels etc.
that are now typically served by the cable networks or satellite broadcasts.
As of March 1990, there are 200 cities in Japan that are served by both INS Net
64 and Net 1500.  By March, 1991, this number will grow to 940, which means all
major cities with population of 100,000.  Since my Fujisawa City is as of
December 1989 serviced by INS Net 64, I could convert one of my two phone lines
to ISDN by paying a little over 10,000 yen (or a new line for paying 72,000
yen) and get Net 64 service for the monthly basic fee of 4,600 yen, equivalent
to two tone-dialing lines.  (I am told by the local NTT office that I must,
however, wait approximately six months to obtain a DSU from NTT that is
required for ISDN connection.  Is it why Carla Hills, the U.S. trade
negotiator, has recently added the DSUs in her list of items for the Japan-U.S.
trade discussions?)  NIFTY-Serve since 1988 has demonstrated ISDN connection,
although formal service never materialized.  Should I switch to ISDN?  Will
ISDN offer a solution to this country where the long distance rates are
believed to be three times as expensive as in U.S.?  We'll see!

Alternatives to NTT's long distance service are available since 1988.  Call for
further information the "free dial" (toll free) numbers: 0120-11-0077 for DDI
(Daini Denden, Inc.; microwave towers), 0120-0088-82 for Japan Telecom (Nihon
Telecom; optical fibers along JR railroad tracks) and 0120-03-0077 for Teleway
(Nihon Kosoku Tsushin; optical fibers along expressways).  Their service areas
are now limited to the Tokyo-Nagoya-Osaka-Sendai corridor, but their chargesare 20-30 percent less expensive and service areas expanding.  Prior registra-
tion by mail is required.  My experience with JT shows their lines a lot less
susceptible to noise, not requiring me to use MNP error correction.

KDD (Kokusai Denshin Denwa or "International Telegraph and Telephone") has long
had monopoly on Japan's overseas telecommunications.  Alternatives to KDD's
overseas service began in October, 1989: instead of KDD's 001- overseas prefix,
use 0041- through ITJ (contact 0120-44-0041 for more information) or 0061-
through IDC (0120-03-0061).  Service countries are in December 1989 limited to
U.S., Hong Kong and U.K., but being expanded month by month.  Their services do
not require prior registration, and so can be used immediately.

The non-Japanese speaking people have made a great contribution to the BBS
movement in Japan in its short history.  Japan's first BBS was run by Steve
Bellamy at a small store in the Sanno Hotel, downtown Tokyo, with his Apple
computer (was it in 1983?).  His Kanto Central BBS later at 0473-79-0098,
now out of service, became in 1986-87 the largest personal computer-based BBS
in Japan and also made a big influence to the near-by BBS's such as MacEvent
Network.  Asia Pacific BBS at 03-436-2180, sometimes erroneously called APG
BBS, now also out of service, ran on IBMPC/XT and RBBS-PC with Stovy Brown as
Sysop, and in 1986-88 boasted one of the best collections of public domain
software.  Tokyo PC's superb, first generation BBS 03-374-2774 was operated1986-88 on RBBS-PC by "The Rabbi" (Alan Duboff).  When he left in January 1987,
a multi-node on-line farewell party, the first of this kind, was held for The
Rabbi and his newly-wed wife Satoko, who watched with their lap-top at their
hotel in Tokyo the farewell speeches from Stephen Campbell, then TPC President,
in Tokyo PC, Ed Bracha on INN, and others on the other BBS's in the Greater
Tokyo area.  In March 1990, Ray Penas started open test on his "first made-in-
Japan" bilingual BBS host program, VBBS.
