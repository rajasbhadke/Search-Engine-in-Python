WE Festival
May 23 - 29, 1996
Wilmington NC
"Come Wreck Our Town"

  Join an eclectic gathering of people who do cool stuff at the WE Festival
in Wilmington, NC, Thursday, May 23 - Wednesday, May 29. It's a seven day
smorgasbord of cool stuff: over 50 bands from around the world, a plethora
of independent / underground films, tons of zines, and an unhealthy dose of
microbrewed beer, will be featured during this seven day romp through our
own private wonderland.

  The Wilmington Exchange is a cooperative organization that encourages
independent thought and creativity. The purpose of the WE Festival is to
present an environment where people can come together, interact, and be
inspired; promoting a sense of community by nurturing artists' careers,
rather than exploiting them. Helping them find the tools to do the work
they love without compromise.

  WE Festival attendees will get in to all participating venues and receive
a We Guide(to help them navigate the new frontier). Plus, they'll receive
access to the Wilmington Exchange Center, where they can bring a bigass bag
and fill it with whatever they desire, since tons of free swag will be
theirs for the taking. The cost to attend the week-long WE Festival is only
$15.00. The cost for anyone attending as a representative of any corporate
conglomerate is $1500.00(that is not a joke).

If you have any questions, email us at WEFestival@aol.com, call Rick at
(910) 256-7867 or Kenyata at (910) 256-3791. Web pages coming soon

Poetry Fest 96
Greenport, NY  June 9 all day and night - hundreds of poets and publishers

This is the first national Poetry Fest and anyone in the poetry scene,
either as a poet or a small press/litmag publisher, is encouraged to
attend. This will be publicized throughout the New York Metro area and
southern New England and will attract hundreds of those interested in
buying/swapping zines.

What I'm arranging for is guest speakers and topics will include
self-publishing, free speech, e-zines and e-poetry, the value of the zine
to the poet, what is modern poetry? the future of poetry and the art of the
zine. Also, there will be tons of readings, so bring some poems.

Tables, $30.  Half-table, $18. (You should easily make this money back)

Too, my wife manages a motel in Greenport (a one block walk from the
festivities).  She can arrange for double occupancy rooms for $55. That's
$27.50 if you're willing to split it with someone else.

Please publish the facts of this release in your zine as soon as possible.
All zine and literary publishers are welcome to Poetry Fest 96, whether you
publish poetry or not.

Earth First Gathering
No location Yet

From: Earth First <actionupdate@gn.apc.org>

What is it Robin? Can it be true?

Well holy tree stumps Batman, they want to have an Earth First! Gathering!

But how can that be? Surely they aren't able to organise one without a
large office and international financing? And any way, they're not wearing
tights. How can they save the world without tights?

I can't believe it Batman - it looks like they're going to try and ask for
help.This is too much. If people start taking control of their own lives
they'll stop leaving it up to us to fight the bad guys. Then what'll
happen? It'll be anarchy - the death of super heroes as we know them!

..... we interrupt this program to bring you an announcement. A lone
individual by the name of Luke is proposing that there is an Earth First!
gathering over the Summer Solstice and would like to hear your opinions. We
are now going live to his house for this exclusive interview.

"Hello my name's Luke and I help put the Earth First! Action Update
together. I'm sending this message to a few people I thought might be
interested and you are one of them! As most of you will know, Earth First!
has 'national' gatherings about every 6 months. Normally about 80 people
turn up and there are talks by different campaign groups, discussions on a
range of issues and generally a good party where we all chill out together.
At the last gathering in Lancashire I agreed, along with 2 others to sort
out the next one for Easter. However, Easter is rapidly approaching and the
other 2 are rapped up at Newbury. Having talked to  a few other people
about this we arrived at the decision that maybe we should put on a really
sorted summer gathering rather than a half sorted Easter one. South
Somerset EF! proposed holding the gathering over the summer solstice. They
proposed that the site should be the single most important priority and
that it should be in  a beautiful area, away from development and
preferably with a stone circle or hill fort. I've also talked the idea over
with Reclaim the Streets and A30 Action along with several other active
people.

What I'd like to know is -What do you think? Would you like to be involved
and what do you think is needed? (Please note that  Earth First! is a doing
word. It is not an exclusive club. All ideas are welcome)

I propose that the gathering is much larger than normal and is geared up
not only as a meeting point for people in the movement, but also as a good
introduction and training for people new to direct action campaigning.
There could be: presentations on ALL direct action campaigns (Roads, Shell,
JSA); a full training in all aspects of direct action campaigning (from
building tree houses to writing press releases); a debate/ speakers forum
(covering any topics people wish to raise from splits in the movement to
life on mars!) ; and also a full range of introductions to positive
alternatives to mass consumerism and generally staying chilled out in a
hectic world (yoga, permaculture, spiritualism etc). These 4 areas could be
placed in 4 separate marquees/large benders and be running continuously
over the length of the gathering. We could also have a lot of drummers,
theatre groups, entertainers for the evenings to ensure it's one hell of a
party!

I'm basically looking for ideas from people and offers of help. There are a
lot of things that could be done with this gathering, especially as it is
not until June. However, I won't keep ranting on about all the ideas I've
got as for it to work really well it needs to be thought about be a lot of
people (get that morphic resonance going!) - we could get someone to give a
talk on that as well.

Firstly I need to know whether people think it is a good idea. How about
the 19th to the 24th of June?If people are intoit, the second area needing
to be sorted is a site. We need a friendly land owner who will let around
300 people camp on her/his land for 5 days. We'll also need running water
and the site needs to be at least football pitch size with space for
vehicles to park away from the tents/tepees etc. Does anyone know the owner
of the site for the Big Green Gathering? That has a stone circle as well.
Or maybe someone knows the owner of Glastonbury and we could get a field
there? Do you know of anywhere we could have? What area of the country
should it be in?

If I get a positive response to this mailing then I'll put a flier out
about it with the next Earth First! Action Update, giving a clearer idea of
the options and what help will be required to get it off the ground. As
with most Earth First! events it will probably be put together in a weird
sort of organised chaos sort of way - but when they come together they're
the best (witness the Whatley Quarry Action). Like I said, if people think
it is a good idea and a few people start offering to help out then I'll set
a meeting for early March and those interested can then start thrashing out
how to get it sorted.

All comments / offers of help to Luke on 01222 383363 or email
'actionupdate@gn.apc.org' or write to PO BOX 7,Cardiff CF2 4XX. Please note
that I'm not 'in charge' ofthe gathering, although I'm prepared to put a
lot of work into ensuring it happens. If the gathering idea gets a good
response then I'll ensure we get a team of people together to make sure it
happens. Anyone is welcome  to be part of that team. Enthusiasm is much
more important than experience. Burnt out experts should help out on a
consultation basis only!"

Resist and Exist
Eugene, Oregon

WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT: Resist and Exist is intended to be a large,
eclectic gathering of punks and activists from all different "scenes" and
walks of life. the focus of this gathering is on unifying the punk
community for positive change through music, cooperation, and activism.

BANDS CONFIRMED AS OF 4/1/1996:(my "official" list was lost in the flood,
so this list is not complete, but rather what I can pull off the top of my
head. If you are playing and are not on the list, pounce on me so I can add
you....sorry...)

Hilt(tx), Absence(mi), Apeface(ca), Terminal Disgust(tx), Orange 42(wa),
Flux of Disorder(co), Brother Inferior(ok), Submission Hold(Vancouver BC),
Defiance(or), Dystopia(ca), Whorehouse of Reps(wa), Resist and Exist(ca),
Divisia(ca), Bristle(wa), Decay(mi), working stiffs(ca),Lowdowns(ca),
Filthy drunks(ca), Rash of Beatings(ar), Free verse(ks),
Carsgetcrushed(ca), 4Q(or), The Fanatics(co), PayNeuter(az),
Christdriver(wa), ungrateful(ky), Pawn(oh), The Skandals(or), No Class(wa),
The Impossibles(az), Mickey and the Bigmouths(ca), Coathangerkids(?), Fury
66(ca), SKAVEN(ca), Armistice(ca), Subject Mad(az), Not My SON(tx&wa),
LeadfootBroadcast(ca), Reform Control(co), Shitbastard(az), Laughing
Stock(ca), The Obliterated(or), Heckle(?), Black Label(ca), The
Readymen(or), Bob of Tribes(ok), and there are probably 15 more I spaced,
but you get the basic jist of it.

We also have workshops planned on subjects like Central american
Solidarity, Prison support, scams, EARTH FIRST!, The Chiapas Rebellion,
pressing records, silkscreening, stenciling, Food Not Bombs, pirate radio,
active resistance, veganism, copwatch, bike repair, internet literacy, and
a bunch more tenative ones.In addition, there will be daily picnics,
women's groups, and anarchist discussion forums, and other fun things like
soccer games, store takeovers, barter fairs, and the like.

As for food and lodging, we at FNB Eugene are planning to do massive
servings twice a day, and there should be enough organized dumpster raids
to fill the gaps. Food stamps are super easy to get here(3days) and are
pretty much legal tender everywhere in town. Although housing is in rather
short supply, there is ample camping, tons of cheap motels, and  a tent
city planned to protest the matrix progrmas springing up all over the
place. The weather is sunny and nice here in the summer, so not having a
place to crash isn't such a big deal.

The gathering itself is totally free, although many of the shows will have
door prices to cover expenses(never more than $5, usually $2) and it is
entirely all ages.

HOW TO GET HERE:Eugene is right on I-5, smack dab an hour from the Pacific
and an hour from the mountains, easily accessible by car, bus, train, or
plane.

Girl Convention
Seattle WA

hi, a few other girls and I are planning a girl convention for next summer.
It is going to be in Seattle on July 5/6/7 that's a friday/saturday/sunday
and it will be a kicking blast so every girl in the whole entire world
should come.  There will be radical workshops where you can learn how to
silkscreen (oooohhhh!!!), how to fix yr leaky faucet so so you don't have
to hire some buttrock guy who charges you a bajillion bucks, self-defense,
etc., discussions about classism, sexism, racism, otherisms  and there will
be good rock shows too with all your favorite girl rockers and zine trading
and an art show and if we can figure it out, there might be a skating
party, too, so don't forget your roller skates or your skateboard!  It will
be really fun.  And two weeks beforehand there will be a similar thing in
Santa Barbara and one week beforehand there will be a similar thing in
Portland so you could  turn it into a big adventure and go to all 3.  And
if you or anyone you know wants to lead a workshop or discussion or
something, that would be rad.   my address is -- Ann McNally/Xavier
Hall/1110 E. Spring/Seattle, WA 98122 and my phone number is 206-220-8592
but e-mail is easiest.  And you can tell everyone about this! /

Goleta Hardcore Festival 1996
Goleta California

Reprinted from Heart AttaCk:
"This summer we're hosting a four-day hardcore festival here in Goleta.
It will start Friday night with five or six bands.  Saturday morning and
afternoon there will be some sort of non-musical activity, followed by
another six or seven bands that night.  Sunday there will be a longer
show with maybe nine or ten bands.  And then on Monday afternoon we're
planning a trip up to the mountains to lay around, eat, swim, jump off
rocks, and hang out.  Hopefully everyone left in town on Monday will be
able to go.  The only bands confirmed to play at this time are Seein' Red
and Torches To Rome.  In the next issue we'll print the complete list of
bands as well as any other pertinent information."

SISTER SUBVERTER  DIY RADICAL WOMEN'S GATHERING
Wisconsin
September 5-8

EVERYTHING YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW:

VISION:  This originally started with two of us talking about women's music
festivals and our non-hierarchical, create n' subvert, politics/lives.  We
wanted to be able to create the fabulous experience of women-only-ness with
the fluidity of more anarchistic gatherings.  We imagined no seperation
between workers, attendees, performers and producers; no lifestyle caste
system (all women welcome); minimal cost; fresh air; play; skill sharing;
networking; lots of space for women to share what's really going on in our
lives; and lots of active participation from everyone involved (ie. YOU).
This is political only in the most personal sense and it's all open to
interpretation. . . .

PLACE:  Daughters Of The Earth (D.O.E) farm is 80 acres of cooperatively
run women's land in  wisconsin.  Ther'e a big barn, a sauna, fire circles,
a lodge, outhouses, trails and all the nature you really need.  There's
plenty of camping space, some trailers, and a few rooms in the lodge. It's
super important for us to respect D.O.E.  These are some of their
considerations:  Drug use of all kinds (except maybe sugar and coffee) is
limited to certain parts of the land.  Pets should only be brought if
you're willing to be super responsible for them.  General respect for the
land like using trails and good manners when dealing with folks in the
surronding area will also be expected.  W'ell send maps and directions at a
later date.

MONEY:  D.O.E. farm requests $16 to $30 for each woman who is camping.  $6
extra per night will be requested for those who would like to stay in the
lodge and an extra dollar or two would be appreciated for women who want to
use the shower in the lodge.  There is oppurtunity for work exchange.  All
money goes directly to D.O.E. farm and you need not give anything to Sister
Subverter in order to attend the event.  We could, however, use any
donations you could give.  Any day now, we'll have T-shirts and patches
with Sister Subverter logos on them, so send us $1-$2 if you want patches,
$8 for t-shirts (let us know if you need more specifics).  All this money
will go towards compensating bands and other expenses.

FOOD:  Vegan meals will be provided, well, with everyone's help.  Everyone
should bring vegan ingredients (veggies, grains, soy products, fruit, etc),
about enough quantity-wise to cover one person.   If you're not sure what
to bring, ask us (or kick in some money instead).

THE SHOW SO FAR:   We are planning workshops and discussions on: women's
land & rural collectives; women working in radical/anarchist networks;
d.i.y. radical sex; and (hopefully) self defense.  There will also be a
dance in the barn, play space, play fighting, sauna, fire.  Bands are still
T.B.A.

DIY:  This means Do It Yourself, which means everyone is encouraged to
contribute her visions, talents, resources, and efforts.  We (Sacha, Mat
and Amara) are not producers; we're just getting things rolling and doing
our best to coordinate everyone's efforts.  Let us know if you want to form
a committee, facilitate a workshop or discussion, plan an event, or share a
skill or resource.  If you're in an all girl band  that would like to
perform, or if you do performances, make films, are a good organizer, can
get free copies, know about PA systems, have access to food or non profit
status. . . LET US KNOW!

CONTACT US:  We'lll put you on our mailing list, answer questions, and
organize the info. you send us about how you'd like to get involved.
