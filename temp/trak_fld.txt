  Track  and  field is one of the most popular arcade  games,  and 
finally came out for the apple ][ series.  The graphics are pretty 
good and it is fun to play.   We hope that this doc file helps you 
to play the game, and get better scores.  On with the info.

[\]Starting[\]

  When  you  boot  up and get to the main menu,  you  have  a  few 
choices.

1-4 Players:   This lets you choose the number of players that you 
want to participate.

Handicapped:   This  allows a player to continue on after he  does 
not qualify for an event.   This is not in the arcade game and can 
be changed for each player in a multi player game.

Level:   This changes the skill level of the game.  The higher the 
number, the longer jumps, lower times etc. Are needed to qualify.

Sound:        This turns on and off the sound

[Space Bar]:  Starts a normal 1 player game.

  After  you  start  the  game you will be  asked  to  input  your 
initials.   These will be used to save your high scores and  world 
records, if you get any.

(%> The Events

\[1]\  The 100 Meter Dash:

  This  is a basic event that you run against your  opponent.  You 
must  press button # 0 as many times as you can and as fast as you 
can to speed you up.  If you are playing more that 1  player,  the 
opponent will press button # 1.

\[2]\  The Long Jump:

  This event uses button # 0 pressed as fast as you can to run, as 
do  all events,  and uses a combination of button # 1 and pressing 
the joystick to the <- [left] to let you jump.

  After  you have run as fast as you can and have arrived  at  the 
line  [which will approach from the left and has an official right 
above it and a sand pit right behind it,  you cannot miss it]  you 
press button # 1 and hold the joystick to the <- until the desired 
angle in reached.

  The  angle  measure  will appear to your -> [right] as  you  are 
holding down the joystick.   The longer you hold the joystick, the 
higher the angle.   We have found that if you jump at 45  degrees, 
you get best results.

\[3]\  The Javelin Throw:

  In  this event,  you press button # 0 as fast as you can to  run 
and gain speed, and then press button # 1 and hold the joystick to 
the <- until the desired angle is reached.

  Similar  to the long jump in the way you control  yourself,  but 
you  have the throw the javelin instead of jumping....You can  hit 
the bird like in the arcade.   We suggest a 45-48 degree angle for 
best results.

\[4]\  The 110 Meter Hurdles:

  In this event,  you have to outrun your opponent,  who is either 
the computer or another player.  To run, you press down button # 0 
as  fast  as  you  can and to hurdle the  hurdles,  you  hold  the 
joystick to the <- [left].   Every time you press to the  <-,  you 
jump and if you hit the hurdle, you lose time.

\[5]\  The Hammer Throw:

  In  this event,  you have to throw a ball tied to a chain as far 
as you can.  To do this, hit button # 0 once and you will start to 
rotate.   After about 5 beeps [revolutions] you have to let go  of 
the  hammer by pressing button # 1 and holding the joystick to the 
<- [left]  to get the desired angle.   You want about a 45  degree 
angle to throw the longest distance.

\[6]\  The High Jump:

  In  this  event,  you  have to jump over a bar set  at  a  given 
height. To do this, you have to press button # 0 once and you will 
speed up.   When you get to the bar,  hold the joystick to the  <- 
[left] until you get the desired angle.  You will start to jump as 
soon as you move the joystick.

  We suggest that you just touch it before you jump to get height, 
and then hold it down to move horizontally.

  By  the way,  you finger will experience great pain if you  play 
this game to much...Beware!

  The  open-apple and close-apple keys can be used instead of  the 
joystick buttons on the apple ][e.
