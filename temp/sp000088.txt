                                                 while waiting to walk her home}
Melodies of words drip
>From the pages - washed
         Clean
By waking thots;
         Blink...
   It was all a dream.
   The freedom of words
   An illusion.  Soaring
   High on a phrase, diving
   To the punctuation.  The
   Power was untrue.  Reality
   Is here now.  Go back to
   Work-
WAIT!
       -and pay no heed to
   Those
Hear Me!
         distracting
Wake Up!
                     murmers;
   You are sick - see your
_This_ is the dream!
   Supervisor...come, we've
   Made
Quick! Remember the Words!
NOW! Before
        the Appointment 
   For you.  Go to Room
   27A
            it's too late!
Capture the feeling in the
Flight of the phrases as
They flow into a stream
      ...and see Doctor
   Weishaupt...
Yes! Dance in the light!
We are
     -Free!-
Once more!  Do not
Look back... -so
    they have 
    your shell;
Where WE are headed,
It matters not.
On the wings
  of  Our
          Soul
We   glide
   to
      what lies 
Beyond the
     Rim of
       Our
           Love.
