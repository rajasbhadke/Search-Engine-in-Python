SOME NOTES ON SUBMARINE COMMAND:
CALL ----> TREASURE ISLAND
      <512>-441-3325
TE YOUR SUB CLOCKWISE OR
COUNTER-CLOCKWISE.

M SHOWS YOU THE MAP.
S SHOWS YOU THE SONAR.
P SHOWS YOU THE PERISCOPE VIEW.

0-9 USUALLY CONTROLS YOUR SPEED.
I SAY USUALLY, BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE
SUB GOES SLOWER WHEN DAMAGED, AND
SOMETIMES GETS UP TO SPEEDS OF ABOUT
20, WHICH I DONT KNOW HOW THAT WORKS.

ALSO SPACEBAR FIRES TORPEDOES AT A
SHIP.

IF YOU FIND ANYTHING ELSE, PLEASE 
UPDATE THIS.

   KILROY
