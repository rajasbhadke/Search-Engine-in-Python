why do you think that Adam?  USAlliance get ragged on more and more every
day. hell.....i just logged onto some fucking board in Maryland and it said
USAlliance board.  I see people everywhere in the goddamn country saying that
they are part of this fucking group.....GOD....how many people were in this
damn thing?....  I don't think that we should announce that we are going out
and coming back as a new group.  I think that we should just go out quitely
and start using a totally different name and start doing things right.  I
just put out 816paint by our group and am getting sedroiusly better at
prodos.  I also seriously don't like the name Iron Legue...makes me think of
baseball... and I hate baseball.  I also think that we should definately
start tlaking on Razors edge again.  Everybody except adam still calls their.
I think that it is a better base for operations than the curse because it
isn't as hard to log onto and it has an easy transfer section.  soooo......
I also think getting a new group and adding some members or just putting out
Good warez instead of puting out every fucking thing that comes along would
be cool.

i like the idea.  it would take more than a little planning.  You don't just
get people to shell out money for a mag....it takes doing.  Maybe we could
make it an electronic mag though...like on disk or something.  i don't know.
I think Apple Assassin should be axed.  I wrote him a letter in E-mail on
Club Zero couple days ago.  He never responded.  But he shoves the USAlliance
thing with his name and his group name and all sorts of shit.  Is this guy a
loze or what?  i don't know him.  I told him to ring up the curse or Razors
Edge to get in touch. also.  Body Glove has been very closely in touch with
ralph lately. And lately told ralph some shit that I would rather not repeat.
anyway.  That is only rumor and nothing else.  I am not sure if he did or
not.  He might be getting out of comptuers here soon.  I see him getting
tired of it right now.

Let Apple Assassin keep releasing IBM wares...this pirate mag sounds pretty
good. The only problem is being able to find new articles to use. I guess for
the programming articles, we could have people cover different aspects of C,
Pascal, assembly, etc...I could write a ware review, and a "Pirate World
News". We could also have a special "pirate history" future like the Curse
history. It's a great idea...all we need now is a name.

how bout asking tom to give us the files on the assembly tutor he is running

They are really basic and understandable.  I will ask him.

Gather as many files as everybody can.  We will use the best.  Also.  I have
the format thing started.  Won't take long to finish.  I totally disagree
with just a bunch of t-files.  I think that would be stupid.  Anyway.  A REL
disk with menu and shit and a cool boot screen will kick ass.  Also.  The
file reader that I am writing is superfast.  It puts the file in memory and
lets you scroll through it at your own pace.  Or page through it....lotza
other mods also.

We start out with one big text file, with everything together, and then ask

Date  :Tue Mar  1st 8:49 pm

Ok, Alan gave me a cal last night and filled me in with the latest.  the only
boards i've been bothering to call are Razor's Edge and MAD, and not much
talk about the group has been going on on the former.  SO, Alan told me the
new ideas about starting theMag and I think it's an excellent idea if we do
it right it will probably be a major success.  I think we should have it all
in a disk, not in stupid, little dinky separate files.  I would picture it as
one loading up the disk<having unpacked it> and seeing a title screen with
the name of the Newspaper and the group and credit, and then striking a
button and a Table of Contents would be displayed on the CRT along with
feature articles (such as the Curse history) I like the idea about having it
menu driven Alan, is there any way you can make it where the user controls
the speed of the scrolling via arrow keys?  Basically we can have the usual
ingredients for example a review of thelatest wares that have been released,
and who cracked them, then for example a bbs review where we select a bbs and
we give a review and rating, also..let's not make it a habit, but we can do a
rag on someone or a group once in a while on someone that we all, and the rest of the modem media hates.  We can have letters sent in from different
users stating their opinions on certain things in the computer/pirate/modem
world. and then select a few letters to publish.  The idea on the tutorials
sound great... also, why not have a little article on phreaking?  No posting
of codes of course, or anything that might land us in trouble, just normal
discussion. Then a section on upcoming software/hardware in the apple
industry. Then the feature articles such as a Curse history...or for example
Pirating back in 83/84, etc etc...Maybe advertise a bbs or two.
At the menu you can chose to what page you wish to turn two, or you can go
through the entire newspaper from begining to end(with an option to quit by
pressing the appropriate ke).  Kinda' like a Newspaper, eh?
I like the name Alan suggested, 'USA Today'.  Anyways, let's hear YOUR
ideas.

If you guys need a temporary homebase until my board goes up, then i can get
a //gs board thats 12/24/96 baud, 20 megs to give us a temporary homebase to
stay at.

Layders.
Body Glove/Sonny

P.S.  Alan, is there anyway you can make animated graphics, for example,
i think it would be cool if we had an advertisement in every newspaper,
advertising a bbs and make it totally awesome with moving pictures etc

Date  :Wed Mar  2nd 1:15 am

i havn';t received a reply from ubik yet.  OK.  The text file reader will
alow people to not only scroll at their own speed but it lets then scroll up
and down.  And quit out anytime they please.  And YES it is extremely small
program.  Something that will make it even smaller is the fact that I have
figured a way to cut the room a text file takes up by 1/4.  You would loose
inverse charecters and SOME special but not too many.  Anyway.  I am writing
a convert program which will put any file easily in that format.

As for the format.  It seems we have us a little disagreement.  I definately
want some phreaking tips and stuff in it.  No codez of course but just like
the numbers to diferent LD services and tips on hacking and shit.  Also.
Other things I would like to see in it that seem to clash with RA's...but
thats life, eh?....anyway.  I think we should put 1 --->GOOD<--- rag file in
each issue not written by us of course.  but like that livin on a ware thing
on Digital Gang.
The thing would be to have it be a tasteful rag....(thats just an idea)....
Also...I think we would do good to let others submit articles to us freelance
if they want.

As far as the protection I think 2 things will fix that.  Copy protection
would be stupid of course but the things I have would not be.  First, simply
change the catalog track.  Secondly the format that some of the files would
be in would obviously keep them from being ousted.

Some other things that would be nice would be to have a HOT BBS list.
Listing the best current bbs's and also have a pirate of the month and l0zer
of the month.  Have the pirate write something about themselve maybe?...who
knows.
Everybody start putting together files.  When you get them done we need to
find a way to get them to me so I can put them together and set the disk up.
Of course it wouldn't go out until we had all looked at the final product.

graphic screens....yeah.  I am already plastering USAlliance animated all
over it.....personally I like the idea.....heh heh......this is still in the
drawing room of course though so nobody get their panties in a wad.....

from him.  I am sure you are very loyal to phrack but personally I think we
need to have it in their.  I think people will read the full disk because it
will be extremely easy to use and FAST.  The reader will have scrolling up
and down and shit.  And YES USAlliance.  I mean christ.  What are we doing it
for in the first place?  Because we love our fellow modemers and want them to
enjoy life by our good bountiful things we provide anonomously????  hell no.
Everybody in this damn group as well as all others have egos that would float
a hot air balloon...seperately!....  As far as a hot BBS list.  not just
9600bps.
 We can have that...and I am sure a lot of em that are 9600 are hot.  But
more on the ilnes of The Curse/Razors Edge/MAD/The Bombay/ and others that
are hot.
anyway.  Everybody isn't as excited about this in the modem world as we are
because some people have tried it and failed.  The only way this will be cool
is if it IS cool.  And that will mean ore than just putting some files
together.

any other opinions???  also.....we need some more suppliers on the other side

Generally I don't usually, and i'm sure y'all agree on this, that we should
all have a say in things and not take orders from just ONE person.  Opinions
and ideas shared is the key to good communication between a group.
Few things I disagree with that have been said so far...I agree with Alan
that their should be a small section on phrack.  Beleive it or not a lot of
the Pirates out there are very much intrested and want to learn more on this
topic, I can name quite a few, Dave/SA, Ubik, Me, Hansel etc etc, there's a
lot of 'em.  Just look how active the phreak section is on MAD515(It's the
most actice sub board there, and that's a "PIRATE" board!)  Nevertheless, we
reiterate that there shall be no posting of codes/accounts, pure discussion,
instructional material only.  Nothing illegal in that.  Also, if we have a
phreak section it will 'bind' the apple modem world together, phreakers as
well as pirates will be reading this and gaining a better understanding in
the subject that they have been left in the dark with.  Putting up USAlliance
on the title page and on the main menu?  Well, there shouldn't be a problem
with that as long as we give credit when credit is due, after all, it is OUR
production...and as long as we give credit to the feedback we get from the
users it shouldn't pose as any problem.  Having a rag file on the first issue
is kinda' sketchy, we should try to get a good impression, but the choice is
yours(If we find something REALLY good with a touch of class to write about
someone).

As far as old pirates go, I can get some things from Electron and Chief
Surgeon, but what kind of material do you want?

Alan, since your doing the majority of the programming, and when have our
ideas sorted out why don't you list the topics that'll be in our first issue
and assign different people in the group to gather information on THEIR
topic(s) and who will be interviewing who on what.

So far we have...

Curse History
Ware Reviews
Tutorials/Instuctional
User Feedback
BBS Review
New Apple Updates(upcoming hardware etc)  <???>
Commentary (Rag)                          <???>

personally I think everybody has their shit down but I would like to ask
certain people to cover certain shit.  Right now I want to reiterate
something though.  One of the reasons for the action about the leadershit is
to make the group more a group and not a dictatorship.  Sonny is chill about
things and this makes us pretty much all equal.  I like our group and
everybody in it is extremely important and has his shit that is obviously
needed.  their...thats said.

I havn't gotten a response from Tom yet about the tutorial but thats probably
because I keep forgetting to ask him on this board...(I e-mailed him on
another board he dosn't call much....keep forgetting for this board..ugh)....

BG...I thought you would do real well writing part of the phreak thing since
you and Adam are the best on that subject in the group.  And Adam is putting
out the review and some other shit.  It would be alright to even put some
stuff from phrack itself as long as we gave the author credit.
The hot BBS list I think should contain the obvious hottest BBS's PLUS one
board number from each member.  In other words.  Each member can advertise
his favorite board.

About the RAG thing.  What I mean about that is like c00l shit like 'Livin on
a Ware' and excellent rags like that.  Not some....'Yo DG....ram your
computers up your asses' rag....c'mon now...be real....

I also think we should let it be known where any of us can be reached (a
board) if somebody has a freelance article they would like to put in.

Also.  I think we should all vote on the pirate of the issue and the l0zer of
the month kinda thing.  This will be fun......everybody get your articles
together though and start getting them to me.  I would even like to include
that text nude in the tfiles section of this BBS.  Lotza stuff to put in.

We can also put the dox to 1 ware in each issue.

the warez that we get from nwo on that I have anything to do with will have

No text nude.  No L0zer of the month.  No printing dox until we have

I think the text nude would be kinda funny and diversified.  I think the
l0zer would be somebody from Mt. Olympus or of course somebody everybody
ahtes.  I think the 1 dox per issue would be great.  And fuck whoever put
them out.  We won't take their names off the dox anyway.  We will just be
distributing it all the more.

of course the whole group will get to see the final product before its put

here. Then you two gathered some dudes and bang.. USAlliance. The way I look
at it both you and killer had an equal share in the formation. Anyway, who
cares, this is about as exciting as Emdy pirate news..

About Necromancer: A) Somebody has been giving slightly wrong info to him
about Alan which has got him in all the wrong impressions. I dunno if anyone
will be able to untangle him from all these screwed up pieces of info he's
been getting.Also, a MAJOR thing is that there is another Blue Adept on his

that we have gotten the ball rolling again. Let's not put ANY bumps in our

Ok, finally gotten through to this damned place, it's always busy.
From what I have seen the last few days on this sub, thing are starting to
deteriorate.  People are arguing, throwing futile threats at each other,
that's not the way to run a group.  Nor is having a dictator stating what
will be done and what will not, because if the group doesn't want it that
way, they will revolt against the leader for obvious reasons.  Basic
Machiavellian principles.
Anyhow.  TO sum up the Newsletter, and to give my two cents worth,
i think that putting up the docs to just one ware would be a waste due to the
fact if that person actually wanted the docs, all he had to do was to call up
a local AE and get them, instead of downloading a whole news letter just to
get 'em.  Don't you agree Alan?, or did you have some other ideas in mind?
Post 'em.  I don't see any problem with Nude Text pictures, who gives a
flying fuck?
 If their done well, people will like 'em, if not, then don't do them.
Right? Putting out a rag file is what everyone wants to get.  Face it.  If a
file is well written graced with a touch of class and intelligence, people
will love to read the scandals that we write abut on different people that
'we' all hate, such as someone's earlier suggestion on Mt Olympus, (We could
save that as a bbs review and give it a poor review).  I have been trying to
contact a few people to help me with some files...with regards to the phrack
section, if I can get on this bbs and contact some older friends I can
>maybe< get some users from Legion of Doom to write some phreak/hack articles
for us.  Sound good?
I think so.  Also, another friend of mine that I am trying to contact is a
guy called 'Swamp Ratte'.  If you've gotten around you will have read some of
this guy's material, funny as hell, he's a good writer and can really get
into someone and change their emotions.  I'll get him to do some stuff for
us.
