                          MEMBERSHIP FORM 

Membership is open to ALL firearm-owners and to ALL law-abiding persons
who believe that ownwrship of firearms is a civil right, not a privilege
- as is a (driver's license) - that the government can revoke. 

JPFO is unique among pro-firearm ownership organizations: no one can 
label JPFO as "anti-Semitic". As a result JPFO confronts Jewish 
politicians and organizations who urge disarmament of law-abiding 
Americans. JPFO also exposes non-Jewish gun-prohibitionists - Sarah 
Brady, etc. - whose falsehoods erode the Constitution's protections
that are most vital to Jews and other minorities. 

The time has come for the huge majority of law-abiding, firearm-owning
Americans to put an end to gun-prohibition. Join others who have made
a commitment to defend the civil right of the law-abiding to own 
firearms. We will press our offensive against all those who, by 
disarming the law-abiding, want to make life easier for criminals or
to reduce obstacles to a genocide, as happened in Germany during the
1930s. If you agree, then JPFO is for you. 


   HELP JPFO BURY "GUN CONTROL" - BEFORE "GUN CONTROL" BURIES YOU!   
     
                           JOIN JPFO TODAY.

                Less than fifty years ago, a broad-based group of

                Rule of Law - honest government - to their county,
                in the iron grip of corrupt and brutal officials. This
                is a shining example of the critical importance of 
                the civil right to be armed. These events were national
                headline news.

                attacking the emotionalism and misinformation of 
                the much ballyhooed "public health approach" to guns
