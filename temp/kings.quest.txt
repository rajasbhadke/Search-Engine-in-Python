| unicorns still roamed the forests   |
| and the merfolk still dwelt in the  |
| shallow wares frequented by men,    |
| there ruled in the kingdom of       |
| Daventry King Edward and his lovely |
| Queen. The people of Daventry were  |
| prosperous and happy, and everywhere|
| peace reigned. But the King and     |
| Queen were sad because they were    |
| childless. They had no son to       |
| inherit the throne, nor a daughter  |
| to gladden their hearts. One bright,|
| sunny day King Edward the Benevolent|
| (for so he was called) and his Queen|
| were walking in the castle garden   |
| when suddenly before then appeared a|
| powerful sorceror. "I know your     |
| problem and I can cast a spell that |
| will bring you a child," he said.   |
|                                     |
| "Oh, great sorceror, if you can help|
| us, we will be everlastingly        |
| grateful," said the Queen.          |
|                                     |
| "We will bestow upon you many       |
| honors, and great riches," said the |
| King.                               |
|                                     |
| "I have no use for honors or riches.|
| My payment will not be so great. All|
| I ask in return is the mahogany-    |
| framed Mirror that hangs in your    |
| private chamber.                    |
|                                     |
|     The sorecor's words game them   |
| pause, for that Mirror was          |
| priceless. It had the power to read |
| the future, and helped to keep      |
| Daventry prosperous. The royal      |
| couple used it to foretell the      |
| weather for planting and harvest, as|
| had the kings and queens before     |
| them. It had been hundreds of years |
| since a crop had been planted before|
| the last frost, or had been ruined  |
| by autumn rain. what the sorceror   |
| desired was indeed valuable. The    |
| King and Queen retired to their     |
| chamber to consult the magic Mirror.|
|     King Edward and his wife gazed  |
| int othe Mirror's depths and saw a  |
| young princely figure with a gold   |
| crown upon his head. Imagining the  |
| youth to be the son they yearned    |
| for, the royal couple gladly        |
| bestowed the Mirrow upon the        |
| sorceror. He took it to his dwelling|
| where he set one of his beasts to   |
| guard over it.                      |
|     The months passed and the Queen |
| did not conceive a child. For the   |
| first time in four hundred years,   |
| Daventry lost the harvest to an     |
| early autumn rainstorm. The King and|
| Queen wept, and everyone tightened  |
| their belts. Instead of having      |
| excess produce to sell to           |
| neighboring kingdoms, the people of |
| Daventry had to supplement their    |
| stores with food bought elsewhere.  |
|     With famine came the dreaded    |
| Plague, and the Queen was stricken. |
| For three days she lay in the grip  |
| of a great fever, and Edward        |
| maintaining a constant vigil by her |
| side.                               |
|     On the fourth day of the Queen's|
| illness, a diminutive figure pushed |
| his way between the legs of the     |
| castle guards. "I have a cure for   |
| the Queen," he claimed. Quickly the |
| courtiers ushered him into the      |
| Queen's chamber, where the King     |
| despaired.                          |
|                                     |
| "I have traveled a great distance to|
| bring relief to your dear wife. This|
| powerful root known only to dwarves |
| will cure any plague."              |
|                                     |
|     The dwarf leaned over the Queen |
| and touched the root to her lips.   |
| Her eyes fluttered open and she     |
| smiled at Edward.                   |
|     The Queen's attendants looked at|
| each other in wonderment. "Only a   |
| touch revived her," the wispered.   |
| "Imagine how fast she will recover  |
| when given the whole root!"         |
|                                     |
| "Ask any reward for this miraculous |
| gift, oh small one," exclaimed King |
| Edward.                             |
|                                     |
| "I ask in repayment the Shield left |
| you by your father when he died,"   |
| said the dwarf softly.              |
|                                     |
|     The King paled at the thought,  |
| The Shield, made of titanium and set|
| with emeralds, was traditionally    |
| carried in battle by the ruler of   |
| Daventry. Legend held that he who   |
| bore the Sheild was invincible, and |
| his army always victorious. Thus    |
| there had been no successful attacks|
| on the kingdom of Daventry for over |
| five hundred years.                 |
|                                     |
| "Ask again little man. I will give  |
| you your weight in gold, but please |
| do not ask for the Shield," said the|
| King.                               |
|                                     |
| "You do not appear to value your    |
| wife's life, your highness," said   |
| the dwarf. "I will take no other    |
| reward than that which I have       |
| requested." Haughtily he turned to  |
| go.                                 |
|                                     |
| "Come back," Edward called. "I'll   |
| give you the Shield." The Dwarf too |
| the shield, and secreted it away in |
| a hole in the ground, in the way of |
| Dwarves.                            |
|                                     |
|     The Queen partook of the root,  |
| but to no avail. She worsened and   |
| died. Daventry's church bells tolled|
| in mourning, and the King vowed     |
| vengence against the false dwarf.   |
| Years passed, and the news of the   |
| loss of he Shield spread. Armies    |
| attacked the weackened Daventry, and|
| the King went out to lead his armies|
| without the Shield. Never before did|
| they have need of the Mirror to     |
| foretell enemy moves. Now, that too |
| was gone.                           |
|                                     |

| the King was very lonely. One day,  |
| while out riding with his courtiers,|
| Edward came upon a pack of wolves   |
| tearing at the lower limbs of a big |
| tree. When the group approached, the|
| wolves scattered to reveal a        |
| beautiful young woman perched in the|
| tree.                               |
|     She descended regally. "I thank |
| you for the rescue, kind sirs. I am |
| the Princess Dahlia, of Cumberland. |
| I was traveling through this land   |
| when that pack of wolves fell upon  |
| my group. My bodygaurd fled in      |
| terror from their fangs, leaving me |
| quite alont. I owe you my life, and |
| my heartfelt gratitude."            |
|     The King was charmed with the   |
| Princess Dahlia, and brought her    |
| back to his castle to visit. He felt|
| new life coursing through his veins,|
| and knew it was because he had met  |
| someone who might fill the          |
| loneliness left my his late Queen.  |
|     In due time Edward asked Dahlia |
| to marry him, and she accepted. The |
| people of Daventry were wildly      |
| excited at the prospect of a new    |
| Queen (and hopeful again of an      |
| heir), and made preparations for a  |
| glorious wedding celebration.       |
|     One the night before the        |
| wedding, when the air was thick with|
| toasts and merriment, Princess      |
| Dahlia bid Edward good night. He    |
| never noticed her hand stealing up  |
| to his belt and extracting the ring |
| of keys hanging there. Much later,  |
| the Royal treasurer approached the  |
| King with alarming news.            |
|     He had discovered the treasury  |
| door standing open, withte King's   |
| own key in the lock. The Princess   |
| Dahlia had been inside, holding a   |
| small Chest of gold.                |
|     The treasurer stood frozen to   |
| the spot. The Princess' bright      |
| laughter changed to a witch's cackle|
| as her form grew old and withered.  |
| She grasped the Chest and mounted   |
| her broom to fly out the open       |
| window. The treasurer watched in    |
| dismay as she swooped up through the|
| clouds and disappeared.             |
|     When the King heard the news, he|
| wept in despair. That Chest was     |
| magic, and the last great tresure   |
| remaining in Daventry. No matter how|
| much was taken from it, the Chest   |
| always remained brimful of golden   |
| coins. Without the Chest he could   |
| buy no more food, pay no more       |
| soldiers.                           |

| charting your progress. Create a map|
