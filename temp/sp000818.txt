"for the liberation of the intelligence"

This zine was born in 1992 in Italy, on a project carried out by some
anarchic guys in order to investigate the subject of communication and its
relationship with revolutionary action.

The idea was to produce a publication for those who have learned, from daily
experience, that this subject is very important; however, the term "communication"
is intended in a wide sense, having in mind not only the language, but also
the behaviour, the symbols, the myths, the cloths and so on. We have
focused our attention on the revolutionary movement and on the anarchic
area in particular.
We often translate materials from languages different from italian (french,
spanish and english) and all collaborations are welcome.
An issue - 20-24 pages - is made around a central theme developed by some
articles with contributions on other subjects, some pictures and nice
graphics and a series of small comments that we call "gocce" (drops). "rAn"
is published  every 4 months.

The zine's name, "rAn", comes from the Kurosawa's movie and means "riot",
but sounds like the computer instruction "run" launching a program.

The following are not the electronic versions of "rAn", but only a series
of texts files corresponding to the articles of the original issue. The
files are in italian, but each one of them is preceded by a small text in
english that summarizes the contents.
