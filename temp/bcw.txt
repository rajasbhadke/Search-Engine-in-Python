=====================================

           INSTRUCTIONS
           ------------

     NOW FINALLY FOR THE INSTRUCTIONS.
    WHEN YOU FIRST WALK INTO A ROOM
    A GUARD WILL ASK YOU FOR A PASS.
    YOU CAN EITHER ENTER A NUMBER
    FROM 1-5 OR BRIBE HIM BY USING
    THE "M" COMMAND. WE FOUND THAT
    THE BEST METHOD OF DISCOVERING
    WHICH PASS TO USE IS BY DOING
    THE FOLLOWING:  

      GIVE THE GUARD THE FIRST PASS,
    THEN IF HE DOES NOT ACCEPT IT
    HE WILL TAKE THE PASS AND ASK
    YOU FOR ANOTHER ONE. YOU SHOULD 
    THEN BRIBE HIM. GO ON TO THE NEXT
    ROOM REPEATING THE ABOVE STEPS 
    UNTIL YOU FIND THE CORRECT PASS.
    (NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE
    ENOUGH MONEY TO BRIBE THEM WITH.)
    ALSO WHEN YOU GO INTO A ROOM MAKE
    SURE THAT YOUR GUN IS OUT OF SIGHT.
    
     TRAVEL THROUGH THE MAZE OF ROOMS
    BY EITHER USING THE MAP OR GOING
    THROUGH IT AT RANDOM PATTERN COL-
    LECTING THE DESIRED SUPPLIES NEEDED
    TO KILL HITLER. IF YOU COME UPON
    A LOCKED CLOSET YOU MAY EITHER
    SHOOT IT OPEN (A DANGEROUS METHOD)
    OR OPEN IT BY DOING THE FOLLOWING:

      EACH DOOR HAS A 3-DIGIT CODE.
    TO UNLOCK THE CLOSET YOU MUST ENTER
    THE PROPER CODE. THIS IS ACHIEVED
    BY RANDOMLY SELECTING THE FIRST 
    DIGIT (EX. 4). IF YOU HEAR A 
    "CLICK" YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS THE
    FIRST DIGIT OF THE CODE. YOU THEN
    GO ON TO THE NEXT DIGIT BY FIRST
    ENTERING THE CORRECT FIRST DIGIT
    AND THEN ENTERING A SECOND NUMBER.
    IF YOU DONT HEAR A CLICK TRY 
    THE PROCEDURE AGAIN BUT WITH A
    DIFFERENT DIGIT. YOU THEN DO THE
    SAME THING WITH THE THIRD AND 
    FINAL DIGIT.

     IN THESE LOCKED CLOSETS YOU MAY
    FIND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS.
    FROM SECRET PASSAGES TO THE BOMB
    ITSELF (WHICH WILL BE LATER EX-
    PLAINED.)
    
     YOU MAY ALSO FIND A DAGGAR INSIDE
    ONE OF THE LOCKED CLOSETS. THE
    DAGGAR IS A VERY USEFULL WEAPON.
    IT ENABLES YOU TO KILL GUARDS 
    WITHOUT WASTING BULLETS. ALL YOU
    NEED TO DO IS WALK INTO A GUARD
    WHILE HIS BACK IS TURNED AND HE
    WILL INSTANTANEOSLY DIE. TO SWITCH
    WEAPONS FROM THE GUN TO THE DAGGAR
    OR VISA VERSA YOU TYPE A COLON.
  
     YOU MAY ALSO FIND A MEDICAL KIT
    INSIDE ONE OF THE LOCKED CLOSETS.
    THIS IS VERY USEFUL IN CASE YOU 
    ARE WOUNDED. TO USE THE MEDICAL KIT
    TYPE IN "F" AND THE COMPUTER WILL
    REPLY WITH "BANDAGING...".

     THERE ALSO CAN BE FOUND A TOOL
    KIT, BUT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE
    IS NO APPARANT USE FOR IT.

     ANOTHER FEATURE OF CASTLE WOLF-
    ENSTIEN ][ IS THAT THERE ARE SEAT-
    ED GUARDS IN VARIOUS ROOMS. THESE
    GUARDS WILL ALSO ASK YOU FOR A
    PASS, BUT IT IS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE 
   TO BRIBE HIM. BY DOING THIS, HE WILL
    GIVE YOU VALUABLE INFORMATION WHICH
   WILL COME IN HANDY IN LATER PARTS OF
    THE GAME. HE CAN GIVE YOU FOUR
    TYPES OF INFORMATION:

     A) HE TELLS YOU WHAT PASS TO USE
        ON THAT CURRENT LEVEL.

     B) HE GIVES YOU A COMBINATION
        WHICH MAY BE USED ON ONE OF
        THE CLOSETS.

     C) HE TELLS YOU THE CIRCUIT BREAK-
        ER NUMBER THAT IS USED TO TURN
        OF THE ALARM.
   
     D) HE GIVES YOU CERTAIN HINTS 
        ABOUT THE GAME.
     
     INSIDE A HEAVILY GUARDED ROOM,
    ABOUT 4 OR 5 GUARDS, THERE IS A
    CLOSET IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
    WHICH CONTAINS A METAL BOX. ON THE
    BOX THERE IS A LOCKED PANEL AND THE
    CIRCUIT BREAKERS. USUALLY TO TURN
    OFF THE ALARM, YOU MUST ENTER THE 
    NUMBER OF THE CIRCUIT BREAKER. THIS
    ACTS AS A TOGGLE SWITCH WHICH WILL 
    TURN THE ALARM ON AND OFF.

              THE BOMB
              --------

     ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS
    OF THE GAME IS THE BOMB. YOU FIND
    IT IN A LOCKED CLOSET AND USE IT
    TO ASASINATE HITLER AND THE CABINET
    MEMBERS. WHEN YOU PICK UP THE BOMB
    A BUILT-IN TIMER AUTOMATICALLY 
    STARTS. IT STARTS AT 1002 AND WHEN
    IT REACHES 0 IT BLOWS UP. TO PRE-
    VENT THIS FROM HAPPENING PREMATURLY
    YOU MAY HAVE TO RESET IT PERIODIC-
   ALLY. THIS IS DONE BY FIRST DROPPING
    THE BOMB (TYPE "B") AND THE HITTING
    "R". YOU WILL THEN SEE THE MESSAGE
    "RESETING TIMER...". WHEN THIS IS 
    DONE YOU PICK UP THE BOMB (TYPE "B"
   AGAIN) AND THE TIMER WILL RESTART AT
   1002.(NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT NO GUARDS
    SEE YOU WHEN YOU PERFORM THIS PRE-
    CEDURE.) 

     TO KILL HITLER YOU MUST TAKE THE
    BOMB TO HIS CHAMBER, PLACE IT NEAR
    THE DOOR, AND RETURN BACK TO PLACE
    WHERE YOU STARTED FROM.
