History
-------
   In the galaxt if Alaxis, a game of strategy and cunning is played which has come to be known as the Beast War.
   Inhabited by several strong but warring races, their constant conflicts had reduced their population to where mutual destruction would result. In 3853 QA, the tribal leaders called a temporary truce, and formed the Council to find a nonviolent means for settling disputes. It was decided that disagreements would be settled by a tournament which would be won through the use of clever strategy. To avoid Alaxian bloodhsed, the tournaments would be fought using semi-intelligent beasts controlled by their Alaxian masters. Any disagreements between the tribes would be settled with a Beast War tornament. 
   Due to racial differences among its members, the Council agreed to three tournament standards. The Terran Common rules were facored by the Humanoid member of the council. These rules enabled the slower-thinking humans to devise innovative strategies. The Alaxian Universal rules were favored by most of the council members. These rules demanded rapid numerical analysis of your position, your strengths, and your opponents weaknesses. To compromise between the desires of the Humanoids and the Alaxians, the Galactic Standard was agreed upon.
   The rules were refined over the centuries. Advancements in holographics technology allowed the destruction of innocent beasts to end.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Object:
------
To capture more sectors than your opponent(s). The game consists of a series of rounds. During each round, you control an army of six beasts. A sector is captured by moving one of your beasts into the sector. Captured sectors will contain one of your beasts, or a small satellite in your color. Each round ends when only one players beasts remain on the galactic grid.

Options:
--------
After you enter your name, the question "Would you like to play against the computer at novice level?" will appear. You canb see the letter Y in a white box. This is the "default condition" and the computer will automatically accept this as your answer if you press return. If you don't want to play the computer at this level, press N for NO and hit return.
   There are four different sets of rules to choose from: novice challenge, terran common, galactic standard, and alaxian universal. Each set changes four factors. A fifth rules set will allow you to set the factors.
  The factors are:
    *the number of rounds to complete a tournament
    *time limit f~or each round
    *the energy recharge time for creatures on the plexus(center of the board)
    *whether or not you want random starting positions

Number of rounds for each tournament: a tournament consists of one to five rounds. At the end of each round, the scores are totaled based upon the number of pieces in play and how many sectors each player has captured. At the end of the tournament, the one with the most points wins.

Number of minutes for each players turn: each player has a timeclock that is turned on each time it is that players turn. Each player must make all of his moves within this time period. Failure to do so automatically ends the game, with that player losing all his pieces.

Plexus recharge time: this is the amount of time it takes for a beast on the plexus(center sector on board) to regain one unit of energy. Energy is lost by moving and by attacking.

Random starting positions: changing the starting positions of the beasts makes it more difficult to predetermine the opening moves of the game.

The Grid:
---------
The galactic game grid has 41 sectors around the plexus. They are arranged in three orbits: the outer, middle, and inner orbit. Surrounding the grid are four colored fields. In the field of your color is a counter showing how many sectors your beasts have captured. When your start a round, you have controlled six sectors, the sectors your beasts are occupying. 
   The beasts move from one sector to another by jumping through hyperspace. Jumping is done by setting up two windows. A home window is built around the beast selected for movement. and a destination window is formed at the sector you want the beast to move to. Once the windows have been built, the beast jumps through hyperspace from the home window to the destination window. Each beast has its own unique movement pattern, as explained in the Beasts section.

When it is your turn to move, the information box in the upper right corner of the screen will display:

(your name)
SELECT
BEAST
USING
(keys or paddle)

Depending upon whose turn it is, and whether you are using paddles or the keyboard, the fourth line could be PDL 0 or PDL 1. A AND S for the A and S keys, or K AND L for the K and L keys. Keys A and K are used to select a beast or sector; keys S and L enter your choice into the computer.
If you want to take back a coice press the ESC key.
   If your are using paddles, rotating the paddle back and forth across the middle area will move the source and destination windows. Pressing the paddle button will enter your choices.

The Graphs:
-----------
To the right of the grid are three graphs showing energy, time and power.
   The Energy and Power grpahs show the condition of the beast the window is on. Energy can be replenished by occupying the plexus sector and by defeating other monsters. When a beast runs out of energy it perishes.
   The power of a beast is determined by its strength, the amount of moral support it has, and its combat bonus. For more info see the Strategy section.
   The Time graph shows how much time you have left to make your moves. If you run out of time, the tourney ends and your beasts perish.

Beasts:
------
There are six different beasts. Each has strengths and weaknesses and a unique movement pattern. In addition any beast can jump into the plexus from any sector in the inner orbit and vice versa.
   Movement consumes energy. Each beast moves to an adjacent sector, but some canb only move to a certain color or direction. Jumping to a sector containing your own satellite(left by a previous friendly beast) consumes two energy units. Entering an empty sector uses four units. Jumping into a sector containing an enemy satellite consumes 12 units of energy. If your beast uses up all of of its energy in making the jump it perishes but leaves one of your satellites in the sector.  The plexus is the center of the grid. As a focus of energy, it will channel that flow into any beast occupying that sector. The rate of flow is set at the beginning of the game. For example, if the recharge time is four seconds, that means that every four seconds, a beast on the plexus will recieve one unit of energy until it is totally recharged.

The Aeroctus:

The aeroctus is the only winged beast chosen by the Council for Beast War. It has 44 energy units. When attacking its prey, the tentacles of the aeroctus close together to form a spear tip which can easily puncture the thin metallic skin of a mechanos. However, the light bone structure and musculature of the creature does not provide it with enough power to easily damage the thick plating of an arachnid. The aeroctus have a strength of four units.
   Movement pattern: the aeroctus can move only to an adjacent sector that is in a different orbit and color.


The Dracon:

The dracon is a fearsom inhabitant of Alaxis. Its awesome flame breath makes it extremely dangerous. The dracon has a strength of nine and its far reaching flame is especially effective against the light bone structure and musculature of the aeroctus. However, it has little effect on the metallic structure of the mechanos. A dracon begins with 16 energy units.
   Movement pattern: the dracon can move to any adjacent sector.


The Arachnid

The arachnid has a highly evolved neuromotor system to control its many legs. It can have up to 38 energy units, and has a strength of 5 units. The great dexterity of this beast enables it to slip its pincers under the protective scaling of a saurus, inflicting especially grievous wounds upon the beast. Only the mighty dracon appears to be resistant to the attack of an arachnid
   Movement pattern: the arachnid can move diagonally only.


The Wraithil

The unique appearance of the wraithil is responsible for its association with a mythological group of hominoid creatures called the Undead. It strikes a chord of superstitious fear in many creatures. This effect is very much noticeable in the saurus, which seems to be afraid to bite down upon a wraithil with any degree of force. The energy field projected from a wraithils hands during combat is known to be especially effective against the highly evolved neuromotor system of the arachnid. However, the diversified nerve net of the aeroctus is resistant to this attack. Wraithils can have up to 30 energy units and have a strength of 6 units.
   Movement pattern: the wraithil canb move to a different colored sector.


The Saurus

The fearsom saurus is believed to be a distant relative of the dracon. Strong competitions for the same ecological niche is suspected of being the basis for the intense hatred sauri have of dracons. In combat, a saurus becomes quite frenzied the moment he bites into a dracon. Although the saurus recovers almost immediately, this results in especially serious wounds being inflicted on the dracon. Known for their bad tempers, sauri turn green with rage when attacking each other. A saurus can have up to 24 energy units, and has a strength of 5 units.
   Movement pattern: the saurus can move to any adjacent sector of the same color.


The Mechanos

The mechanos is the only silicon-based lifeform in Beast War. It is therefore the only beast capable of using a gravgen propulsion system. A mechanos is not intimidated in the least by a wraithil, and is effective against one in combat. A mechanos can have up to 20 energy units, and has a strength of 8 units. The laser weapon of a mechanos is largely dispersed by the reflective scaling of the saurus and thus is less effective against the beast.
  Movement pattern: the mechanos can move to an adjacent sector in a different orbit.


Combat:
-------
If you select a destination sector which  contains an opponents beast, its power and energy will be shown alongside your beasts ratings. If the move is made, combat occurs.
  The top view of the grid is replaced by a side view of the sector with the two beasts facing each other. At the top are their energy and power graphs.


Controlling the Beast
---------------------
If the keyboard controls are being used, the following keys are used to control the beasts:

Left group:
  A:move left
  S:stop
  D:move right
  W:flee
  X:attack

Right group
  K:move left
  L:stop
  ;:move right
  O:flee
  .:attack

If paddles are being used, turning the dial to the right will move the beast to the right and turning it left will cause it to move left. Centering the dial will stop movement. Pressing the paddle button while the beast is advancing or standing still will cause the beast to attack. Pressing the button while youu beast is backing up near the edge of the screen will cause it to flee.
  A beast can flee only to its original position, and then only if it contains one of your satellites. If it is already occupied, it cannot flee. If it doesn't have enough energy to make the jump, then it will perish when it emerges from hyperspace. Fleeing from your opponent will allow your enemy to move again.


Scoring:
-------
The round ends when only one players beasts remain on the galactic grid. At the end of the round, each player receives 300 points for each beast remaining on the field, and 150 points for each captured sector. At the end of the tournament, the player with the highest score wins. If you have been playing against the computer using one of the standard rule set, your name and score will be saved.


Special Features:
----------------
PAUSE
 Holding down the CONTROL key and the P key will stop the game. Press return to continue.

SOUND
 Pressing CTRL-S will toggle the sound.

QUIT
 Pressing CTRL-Q will end the tournament.

RESET HIGH SCORES
 Press CTRL-R and the high scores will be reset back to 0.

SELECTING A DIFFERENT BEAST
 If you have selected a beast and change your mind, pressing the ESC key will allow you to choose another beast.

                            Strategy for Beast War
                            ----------------------

The bjective of Beast War is to capture more sectors than your opponent(s). To do this you should consider your beasts movement patterns, energy, power, combat capabilities and strategic positioning.   The movement patterns of your beasts need to be carefully considered to enable you to capture sectors, attack your opponents, and defend your terrain. For example, certain beasts will only move on one color. Moving it through the plexus canb change the color of the sector it is on. Moving a beast through the plexus also enables it to regain energy. However, trading beast positions can cost valuable time, allowing your opponent to takle the initiative.
  Moving to a sector containing an enemy satellite uses much more energy than moving to a free sector. It is advantageous to block your opponents moves with your own satellites. If your opponent captures a sector containing your satellite, his beast will be weakened and open for attack.
  This strategy calls for using your energy efficiently. Your beasts canb gain energy by capturing and defending the plexus against your opponents, and by defeating them in combat. Since beasts lose energy through movement, any move that does not enhance your position is a wasted move.
  If your beasts energy is less than three units it will perish on the next move. There is little you canb do with it in combat unless it has a very long weapon range versus its opponent.(such as the dracon fighting the aeroctus) The kamikazee strategy is recommended: move into a sector containing an opposing satelitte and (poof!) your beast is gone but leaving a friendly satelitte behind.
  But to be a successful Beast Warrior, you have to fight well. The amount of power a beasthas is determined by its strength, moral support, and combative relationship with its opponent. The strength is determined by its nature; it cannot change. If the adjacent sectors contain friendly forces, your beast will be strengthened by their presence. Each friendly beast will increase the combatants power by one unit.
  Finally each beast is especially effective in fighting one other beast, and resistant to attacks by one other beast. These factos provide combat bonuses which canb increase or reduce a beasts power by 2 units. The Beasts section provides more info on this.
  The power graph reflects the sum total of these factors. In combat, the amount of damage a beast does is determined by a random number that depends upon its strength, moral support, and combat bonus. The minimum amount of damage inflicted upon your opponent is determined by your beasts moral support and combat bonus. So a beast which has a combat bonus and moral support can often be quite successful in deafeating an apparently more powerful opponent by repeatedly striking with an above average amount of damage.
  Your positiin becomes greatly improved when you defeat an opponents beast, and greatly weakened when one of your beasts are defeated. If your beast is defeated, you lose a sector and a beast, your total energy pool is reduced, and the victors pool is increased. It is often the better part of valor to retreat when threatened by a superior force. Fleeing from combat is also costly, though not as much as being defeated. Recovering from a flee will lose time and energy, but it will preserve your beast.
