SPECIAL NOTE: BEFORE YOU START TYPING YOUR TEXT------GO TO #4 - FORMAT SUBSYSTEM ---- SET MARGINS,TEXT LINES,& ETC.    ****VERY IMPORTANT IF YOUR GOING TO USE 80 OR 132 COLUMNS ****




SAVING FILES:                             
    Normal saving routines as in APPLESOFT, these saved files are TEXT files and are SEQUENTIAL ACCESS TEXT FILES.



BOOTING THE SYSTEM:   

    Two diskettes - MASTER & DRIVER

    Boot MASTER disk first
    When prompted insert DRIVER in DRIVE 1 or type: ,S(slot#),D(drive#),V(volume#). You must begin this command with a ",". It's not necessary to include all three commands if locations are normally installed drive slots-- ",D2" is enough and then hit RETURN.



SYSTEM MENU:   

    1.EDITOR SUBSYSTEM--
            This  is the subsystem in which you create the text. If you select the Editor, a blank video "page" comes to the screen.This is the space in which you type, and it simulates the document.

    2.FILER SUBSYSTEM--
            This  subsystem contains all the functions for creating data diskettes and saving and retrieving data from disks,including giving a file a name, deleting a file, and clearing the file that's on the screen. When you select the Filer, another menu comes to the screen.

    3.PRINT SUBSYSTEM--
            This  is the subsystem that allows you either to print your document on paper (hardcopy) or copy it onto another disk for transmission to another terminal (softcopy). When you select the Print Subsystem, another menu comes to the screen. This menu allows you to select the kind of copy (soft,hard), the number of pages to be printed, whether the printer should stop at the end of each page, the number of copies to be printed and etc.

    4.FORMAT SUBSYSTEM--
            This  lets you define for the system the physical size of your form and text by setting text length and width, margins, and vertical spacing. When you select this Subsystem,another menu comes to the screen.

    5.CONFIGURATION SUBSYSTEM--
            This  allows you to adapt MAGIC WINDOW II to your hardware. By answering the menu, you can tell the system such things as whether you have an adapter to show lower-case letters on the video screen, any video or printer drivers and whether you can use the Shift key rather than ESC for upper case.

    6.EXIT TO BASIC--
            This command gives you a convenient way to exit without having to turn off the power.

            
SELECTING A SUBSYSTEM:   

     To select each subsystem in the menu just type the number that corresponds with the function you wish to run or use the cursor arrows to move to the correct function.


CHANGING SUBSYSTEMS:   

     You must return to the MAGIC WINDOW II System Menu to change subsystems. To exit any subsystem except the Editor and return to the MAGIC WINDOW II System Menu, you can either press ESC; or position the indicator on function 1.MAGIC WINDOW II SYSTEM MENU, then type 1 or press RETURN.

     DO NOT USE RESET TO RETURN TO MAGIC WINDOW II SYSTEM MENU !!!!!!

EXITING THE EDITOR:   
     The Editor is the only subsystem that requires a sequence of keys to be pressed to return to the MAGIC WINDOW II System Menu. The Editor's function is to provide a space in which you can type and edit a document. When you enter the Editor, all you see is a blank "page". You can only exit the Editor by pressing "CTRL,SHIFT,@".








OPTION SELECTION:   

     In order to change any values, you first have to position an indicator on the option you want to change.
            1.The simplest is to just press the letter of the option you want to change. This causes another indicator to appear in the upper, or options section of the menu on the option you selected. If there is already an indicator in the options section, you can move it to the one you want by typing the appropriate letter.
            2.The other method is to move the indicator to 2.CHANGE OPTIONS  by either typing 2 or using cursor arrows. Then either type 2 again or press RETURN. This will also cause an indicator to appear in the options section. However, with this method, the indicator will always appear on the first option listed. If you want an option other than option A, you have to move the indicator either by typing the appropriate letter or using cursor arrows.
     You can use ESC to exit the options section of any menu. When you press ESC, the indicator in the options section disappears, and the indicator in the functions section automatically returns to 1.MAGIC WINDOW II SYSTEM MENU. You can also exit by typing the number of the function you want; the options indicator will disappear, and the functions indicator will move to the function you selected.
     To change a numerical option, position the indicator on it, then either type its letter again or press RETURN. The prompt ENTER VALUE FROM -TO- will appear, followed by a flashing cursor. Type the value you want (within the limits given) and press RETURN. The new value will be recorded by the system, and the number on the option line will change.
     To change a logical option, position the indicator on it. Then either type the letter again or press RETURN to change to the alternate answer (YES to NO or vice versa). This is called "toggling". It means that with each press of the key (either the letter or RETURN), a circuit is opened and closed in sequence. When it's open, the system receives a signal meaning YES; when closed, a signal meaning NO.

     HINTS:
            Page length- change from 66 to 12. At 6 lines to the inch, this would make a good-sized mailing label (2" high).

Summary of Menu Selection;
     1. To select and execute a function, type the number of the function twice.
     2. To select and execute a change in a numerical option:
            a. Type its letter twice.               b. Enter the desired value.
            c. Press RETURN
     3. To select and execute a change in a logical option, type its letter twice.
     4. To exit the options section:
            a. Type the number of the function you want, or
            b. press ESCape.
     5. To exit another menu:
            a. Type 1 twice to select and execute the 1.MAGIC WINDOW II SYSTEM MENU command and re-enter the System Menu.
            b. Select and enter the subsystem you want by typing its number twice.


FILER SUBSYSTEM:   

     The Filer Subsystem, appropriately named, provides all the functions necessary for handling document and text files- from initializing a data diskette so you have a storage medium; to saving, loading, deleting, and clearing a file from memory. Also you can tell the system about your disk drive configuration.

     File types-
            FORMATTED-- A formatted file is an exact duplicate of the document as you typed it, including margins, spacing, and tab stops. When written (saved) to disk, a formatted file retains the format you specified in the Format Subsystem. When read (loaded) into memory from disk, you get back exactly what you saved.
           UNFORMATTED-- An unformatted file looks exactly like a formatted file when you type it and when you load it into memory from disk. However, it is stored without the format information (margins,tabs, and so on), and each line is considered a separate unit. This means that you can save as an unformatted files any portion of text in memory (available to be seen on the screen), without having to take the entire file. You can also load any portion of an unformatted file that you wish. And, finally, you can transfer any amount of text in an unformatted file - from one line to the entire file--and merge it into a formatted file.

     File Names - Each file you save, whether formatted or unformatted, must be given a name. It can't exceed 15 characters in length, and it must start with an alphabetic character, but may include spaces, numbers, and special characters.

DISK SPACE:   

     A disk has 560 sectors (16 sectors per track, 35 tracks). For storage purposes, it is wise to figure on about 400 available sectors.


FILER MENU:   
        
Options Menu--
     A.DISK SLOT- This tells the system the number of the slot the disk drive interface card is in. The default is 6, since that's the slot most often used. The limits are 0 to 7.
     B.DISK DRIVE- This tells the system the number of the disk drive you are using. The default is 1, which tells the system to access the disk in disk drive 1. If you are alternating between disk drives, you must change this option accordingly, each time you change disk drives. The range is 1 to 255 to accommodate hard disks.
     C.DISK VOLUME- While it varies from brand to brand, the amount of storage on a hard disk may be equal to that of 100 or more floppies. Volume is a numerical address used by a hard disk. The correct volume must be entered to access it. There are no volumes, as such, on floppies, and the default value of 0 acts as a "wild card". You never change the value when using them.

SAVING FILES NOTES:   
     If the file you want to save was loaded into memory from disk, when you execute, the prompt UPDATE AS "FILE NAME"  comes to the screen. This prompt asks if you want to save the file under its original name. If you want it saved under its original name, type Y for YES. The system will automatically save the file over the original, and give it the same name. (This only occurs if you are saving on the same disk as the original was on.)

FILES DIRECTORY- This command brings up a listing of all the text files stored on the disk in the disk drive--formatted and unformatted. Each item with F for formatted or U for unformatted and includes the number of sectors.

UNFORMATTED FILER SUBSYSTEM:   
     When you select and execute this command, another menu comes to the screen with the options and functions needed for saving, loading and/or transferring all or part of unformatted files.

DOS COMMAND:   
     This system provides instructions to the disk, so that it knows how to save or load files.
     NOTE: Whenever you have to enter a file name, you must include the .MW suffix. That is the way the name is listed in the DOS catalog, and it is considered part of the file name. If you omit .MW suffix, you will get an error message FILE NOT FOUND.

     INIT-- To initialize a data diskette, type INIT FILE NAME and press RETURN. This transfers a file with the formatting data onto the diskette. Just like text files, however, you have to give the formatting file a name. The .MW suffix is not needed because this is not a MAGIC WINDOW II text file (that is, no text created in the Editor is stored in it).
            EXAMPLE: DOS COMMAND -> INIT HELLO

     CATALOG-- Type CATALOG after the prompt and press RETURN.
            EXAMPLE: DOS COMMAND -> CATALOG
     
     DELETE-- To delete a file, type DELETE FILE NAME, then press RETURN.
            EXAMPLE: DOS COMMAND -> DELETE FILENAME.MW

     RENAME-- To change the name of a file, type RENAME FILE NAME a comma (,), new FILE NAME. Don't forget the COMMA (,) or you'll get an error message. Also be sure to add .MW after the second name.

     LOCK-- Type LOCK FILE NAME to "lock" a file against being saved over or deleted.

     UNLOCK-- Type UNLOCK FILE NAME to open a locked file so you can save over it or delete it.

CLEAR FILE IN MEMORY:   
     When you select and execute this command, the text stored in memory is erased. Also, loading a file from disk automatically erases the text in memory.


ERROR MESSAGES:   
     
     DISK FULL-- This comes up when the disk you're trying to store a file on runs out of space. The system will store as much of a file as it can before the message appears. This in no way affects the text in memory.

     FILE NOT FOUND-- This error message comes up when the system can't find a file with the name or number you have specified. If trying to load a text file, check the number and enter the correct one. If trying to use a DOS command, check that the spelling and spacing are correct, and make sure you've included the .MW suffix.

     I/O ERROR-- Disk drive door open or not having a disk in the specified drive.

     FILE LOCKED-- Same as Applesoft error.
     
     WRITE-PROTECTED-- Same as Applesoft error.

     FILE TYPE MISMATCH-- Same as Applesoft error.


PRINT SUBSYSTEM:   

Options Menu:
     A. STARTING PAGE NUMBER-- This option lets you tell the system what page number to print on the first page or hardcopy. This has nothing to do with asking for the number of the page you want the printer to start printing. It has to do with assigning a page number that will be printed on the page. There is a function in the Editor that allows you to assign a title line (a special line to go on the top or bottom). You can assign both a title and a page number.
     B. NUMBER OF COPIES-- This option tells the system how many copies of the same file you want printed. As many as 255 copies.
     C. SINGLE SHEET FEED-- This command tells the printer to stop at the end of each page. Then you can put a new sheet of paper in.
     D. MARK PERFORATION-- This command tells the printer to mark the end of a page of roll paper. The default value is NO, because form perforated paper is the most common. If you are using roll paper, however, toggle the answer YES, so a perforation line will be marked at the end of each page. DON'T USE FOR PERFORATED PAPER ALWAYS ANSWER NO!!!.
     E. PRINT ALL PAGES-- The default value is YES. This means that the system will start on page 1 and print the entire file. If you want to print only part of a file, you must change this answer to NO. Then, when you select PRINT HARDCOPY, the system will ask START AT PAGE # and HOW MANY PAGES so you can define which pages you want.
     F. PRINT FROM FILE LIST-- Using function 5 in this menu, you can create a list of files you want to have printed in any order you specify. This command tells the system to print from that list. The default is NO, since you will probably be printing individual files separately most often. The files you want to create must all be on the same disk. This function is useful if you have one document saved in several files. When prompt FILE LIST appears then give the list file a name, then type the numbers in the order that you want the files, the system will then show you the list and ask for an O.K.


STOPPING THE PRINTER:   
     Hit ESC, the printer will complete the line it was printing then stop.

     PRINTING SOFTCOPY-- This command allows you to make an exact copy of the file on disk and can be transmitted by electronic mail (i.e. via a modem or phone line). 





EDITOR SUBSYSTEM:   

     Whatever document or letter that is in memory will be partly visible on the screen in the Editor. Partly because you can only see 22 lines at a time.

VIDEO DISPLAY:   
     UPPER AND LOWER CASE-- A standard display shows all characters in upper-case block letters. A true upper-case character is inverted, that is, a dark letter on a light rectangular background.
     CURSOR-- The cursor is a flashing rectangle of light that shows where on the screen a function will begin or occur.
     When you press ESC for upper case or use the Shift Key, the flashing cursor has a colon in it to distinguish it from the cursor, so you know the system has recognized the signal for upper case.

DISPLAY WIDTHS:   
     The standard Apple display is 40 columns wide. If you have a 70 column video driver, you will see 70 characters across, if you have an 80 column board you will see 80 characters.
     
     HORIZONTAL-- The left edge of the screen is the inside of the left margin.

     VERTICAL-- If your text length is greater that 22 lines, the screen will update vertically. A dotted line across the screen marks the end of one page and the beginning of the next.


MESSAGES AND PROMPTS:   

     There are a number of messages displayed at the top of the screen to help you keep track of which file you're using, where you are in the file ,and where you are on the page.

            EXAMPLES:
             ! FILE NAME...... P #  L #  C #    !
             ! FILE NAME...... P #  L #  C #   (R.A.)                                  (L.A.) FILE NAME...... P #  L #  C # (R.A.)                                    (L.A) FILE NAME...... P #  L #  C #    !

     ! - The exclamation point tells you that you are at a margin. If your text width is less than your video display, there will be an ! at each edge of the screen.
    (R.A.)- The right arrow indicates that the there is space between the right side of the window and the actual right margin.
    (L.A.) - The left arrow indicates that there is space between the actual left margin and the left side of the window.
     FILE NAME - This is the name of the file you have loaded into memory.
     P - This stands for page. The number that follows it tells you which page of the file the cursor is on.
     L - This stands for line. The number that follows it tells you which line of the page the cursor is on.
     C - This stand for column. The number that follows it tells you which column or character position the cursor is on.

WORD WRAP:   
     MAGIC WINDOW II automatically brings to the beginning of the next line, any continuous character sequence that would go past the right margin.


EDITING TEXT:   
     
     You can edit characters or delete characters by using the Space Bar. When you press the Space Bar, you get a space as the replacement for the character you had.








     CURSOR-- If you use the repeat key with the following functions the editing will be speeded up:
            CTRL+H- cursor left one character
            CTRL+U- cursor right one character
            CTRL+Q- cursor up 1 line
            CTRL+Z- cursor down 1 line
            CTRL+W- cursor up 12 lines
            CTRL+X- cursor down 12 lines
            CTRL+E- cursor to top of file
            CTRL+C- cursor to end of file
            RETURN- cursor to left margin of next line

     TABS-- CTRL+SHIFT+^ - set TAB
            CTRL+SHIFT+](M) - clear TAB


            CTRL+A - cursor to tab stop to the left
            CTRL+S - cursor to tab stop to the right

PAGE SELECTION:   
     
            CTRL+P is the basic command sequence that moves the cursor to what's called the "home" position on any page. "Home" is the very first character position on a page.
            
            CTRL+P,RETURN- cursor home on current page.(If you don't enter a value after the prompt, the system assumes you mean the page that's on the screen)

            CTRL+P NO.,RETURN- cursor home on page N (page number in the file)  (When you type the number, it appears after the prompt.Backspace and over type to correct the value, if needed)

            CTRL+P (R.A.),RETURN- cursor home on next page (When you press the right arrow, the word DOWN appears after the prompt. "right arrow= to the right=forward"

            CTRL+P (L.A.),RETURN- cursor home on previous page. (When you press the left arrow, the word UP appears "backwards (previous page) is "up" in the file"

            CTRL+P (R.A.) NO.OF PAGES,RETURN- cursor forward N pages. (This moves cursor to home position on the page specified number of pages past the one on the screen

            CTRL+P (L.A.) NO.OF PAGES,RETURN- cursor backwards N pages. (Same as above but UP in the file instead)


CHARACTER EDITING:   

     OVERTYPING- backspace and overtype
     DELETE- CTRL+D- delete a character in the cursor position
     INSERT SPACE- CTRL+F- fill in spaces anywhere on a line with the cursor
     








LINE EDITING:   

     CTRL+L- DELETE THE END OF A LINE- delete all text on a line, from the cursor position to the right margin
     CTRL+I- INSERT BLANK LINE- insert a blank line "above" the line the cursor is on. The line of text the cursor is on moves down,leaving a blank line in its place
     CTRL+K and CTRL+O- DELETE LINE- use either of these to delete a line the cursor is on for both text and blank lines.CTRL+K- "kill" text below the line the cursor is on moves up to close the space. CTRL+O- the text below the deleted line stays where it was. WHEN YOU USE EITHER OF THESE COMMAND, THE SYSTEM STORES THE LINE(S) YOU DELETED IN A "BUFFER". THE BUFFER CAN HOLD 16 LINES AND CAN BE RETRIEVED.

     CTRL+R-RECOVER LINE- retrieve the lines stored in buffer.(when using CTRL+K,CTRL+O) place them anywhere in file. The last line deleted is the first line recovered.The first deleted is at the bottom of the stack.If you kill more the 16 lines the others will be erased.
     CTRL+T-SPLITTING A LINE- split text anywhere,have text to right of cursor move to the left margin of next line.Position cursor exactly.
     CTRL+G-GLUEING A LINE- bring text up from a line below to the line with cursor on it.
     CTRL+J-JUSTIFICATION- justify text-evenly distribute the characters, spaces. L/EFT-line flush left;R/IGHT-last character flush right;C/ENTER-line centered;E/XPAND-spread out evenly;P/ACK-pack smallest spaces possible;S/KIP-skip line cursor is on.
     CTRL+V-DITTO- repeat character on line directly below it 

EDITOR FUNCTIONS:   
 

CONTROL Y = new menu for extra functions. 
         
           1. EDITOR SUBSYSTEM-(returns to main menu)  
                                                   2. SEARCH AND REPLACE
           3. TITLE LINE
           4. CLEAR ALL TAB STOPS
           5. LINE MODE
           6. PARAGRAPH MODE


  2.SEARCH AND REPLACE-look for a particular character and automatically replace with another character.Remember to place cursor at home position.
When selected the prompt SEARCH FOR comes on the screen,followed by a flashing cursor. Type the string you want the system to find,then press RETURN. There is no differentiating between upper/lower case,however all spelling,spacing,& punctuation must be exact for the search to be correct. The prompt REPLACE WITH come to the screen,followed by the flashing cursor. If you only want to delete the string and replace it with nothing,just press RETURN. If you want to replace it with another string, type the string and press RETURN. The prompt REPLACE ALL Y/N will come to the screen,followed by the flashing cursor. If you want all occurrences of the string replaced automatically, type Y for YES. When the function is executed, the system will automatically find all occurrences of the search string & replace each with the replace string (even if you indicated nothing). The search begins at the position of the cursor. 
If you prefer to decide on each occurrence separately, press any key other than Y. When the function is executed, the system will find the first occurrence of the search string after the cursor position, and the prompt REPLACE Y/N will come to the bottom of the screen in the Editor. If you want to replace that string with the specified replacement string, type Y, if not press any key other than Y.You can either leave the string as is or replace it with anything you wish.
To actually execute the function once you've answered the prompts, return tho the Editor and press CTRL N.This moves the cursor to the first occurrence of the string. If you answered YES to REPLACE ALL the system will automatically continue through to the end of the file. If NO,you must press CTRL N each time you want to move the cursor to the next occurrence of the search string.

Note: Both of these function take place from the cursor position on. Therefore, remember to place the cursor in the home position on the first page of your document, so no string is missed.
Also remember,the system doesn't distinguish case. If a replacement string starts a sentence, you must manually change the first letter ot upper case. 

  3.TITLE LINE - This command allows you to place a title in the top or bottom margin of each page. (This is the only way you can get text into a margin, & the same text will appear in the same position on each page).It can also have the system automatically number the pages sequentially when the document is printed.
The system will use for a title whatever text is on the line the cursor is on. When you execute the function, the system removes the line from the text area, position it in the margin (top or bottom) and leaves a black line in the document. 
To create a title line:
  Position cursor on a blank line and type the title line exactly as you want it to appear. (you can use a heading or any other text the already exists,however since the text is remove for the body of the document,you'll have to retype it if you want it there). Leave the cursor on the line with the text you're using as a title.

To indicate pages to be number in printout:
 Place a ' # ' on the same line as the assigned title in whatever position you wish. If you want the numbers in the center of the page, position the # in the center,if right margin position # there. The system holds each # as a place for a digit. Therefor if you have more than 9 pages,but less that 100, you would put ##;if it is 100 to 999, you would put ###, & etc. If you have a section number & page number separated by a hyphen(-) you would put 1-# (or 1-##). You can start with any number, use the STARTING PAGE # option in the Print Subsystem.

To position the title line:
 Enter CTRL Y menu. Type 3 or press RETURN with the indicator on this command. The prompt PLACE TITLE AT LINE # will appear, followed by a flashing cursor. Type the number of the line within the top or bottom margin on which you want the title (and page number) to appear, then press RETURN. (If you enter a line number that is not in the margin, the message TITLE NOT IN MARGIN! will appear,press RETURN to continue).
The Editor will return to the screen with the title removed from the text area & positioned on the assigned line in the margin. 

To remove a title line,just replace the assigned title line with a blank line. To do this, enter the Editor and place the cursor on a blank line. Press CTRL Y to enter the Editor functions menu. Type 3, or press RETURN twice to select and execute TITLE LINE. Answer the prompt PLACE TITLE AT LINE # by typing any line number that's in the margin you title line is in. (Example: title line is in a top margin of 6 lines, you can enter any value from 1 to 6). Press RETURN and title line you had will be replaced by a blank. 

 4. CLEAR ALL TABS STOPS - If you type 4 or press RETURN with the indicator on this command, you will clear all tabs stops in the file at once. This is, of course, faster than moving to each tab using CTRL A or CTRL S then using CTRL M to clear each one individually.

 5. LINE MODE - This refers to the number of lines the system will automatically glue with the CTRL G or justify with the CTRL J . This is the default mode, and unless you change it, the system will glue or justify one line at a time.

 6. PARAGRAPH MODE - If you select & execute this command, the system automatically glues or justifies all the lines in the paragraph the cursor is in. The end of a paragraph is defined by the system by either an indented line or an extra blank line between text lines. (We say 'extra' because if your text is double spaced, the system will look for a set of four blank lines as the identifier.) This is, the system knows when it reached either an indented line or an extra blank line, that it has reached the end of the preceding paragraph.                                                                                                                         
     
         CTRL+B-ENTER CONTROL CHARACTER- for printing purposes CTRL+B tells the system to differentiate between a command for editing purposes and a message to the printer. 
            CTRL+B 1 = !           CTRL+B 2 = @
            CTRL+B 3 = DELETE      CTRL+B 4 = ~
            CTRL+B 5 = \           CTRL+B 6 = ^
            CTRL+B 7 =             CTRL+B 8 = [
            CTRL+B 9 = ]           CTRL+B 0 = {
            CTRL+B * = }
     The are some characters that will confuse the printer with the CTRL+B, don't use the following combinations, CTRL+B J, CTRL+B D, CTRL+B C.

FORMAT SUBSYSTEM:

CALCULATIONS FOR FORMATTING:
     To set the options correctly for your paper,you need to know that the system operates on the following measurments-
            6 lines per (vertical) inch (LPI)
            10 characters per (horizontal) inch (c CPI)

These are standard measurements, check your printer manual for other specs.

     PAGE LENGTH-- Total number of lines that a page will hold,from top edge to bottom edge. The default 66 lines is standard for 11" paper (6 LPI x 11" = 66). Range is 1-112. To determine the correct value, multiply the papers length in inches by 6.
     TOP MARGIN-- This is the blank space between the top edge of the paper and the first line of text. The default value of 6 gives you a 1" top margin (6 LPI/6 lines = 1"). Range is 0-111. To determine the correct value, multiply the desired size in inches by 6.
     TEXT LENGTH-- This is the number of lines of text allowed to type per page. The default is 54 and it gives you 9" of text (54 lines/6 LPI = 9"). With 9" of text and a 1" top margin,the bottom margin will be 1"(9" text + 1"top margin = 10"; 11" paper -10" = 1" bottom margin). Text length has the same range as page length 1-112. To fill the page from top edge to bottom edge. To determine the correct value, multiply the desired length in inches by 6. NOTE** The sum of the top margin and the text length cannot exceed the page length. Example--your page is 8" long,the value for page length would be 48 (6 LPI x 8"=48). You can't have a value equal 50 because 40+10=50 and you would have to have a paper of 8 1/3" long to handle that and you've already told the system that it's 8" long.
     PAGE WIDTH-- This is the total number of characters that will fit across the page from edge to edge, at 10 characters per inch (CPI).The default is set for 8 1/2" wide paper (8"x10 CPI=85). Range is 20-160. To determine the correct value for your paper, multiply its width in inches by 6.
     LEFT MARGIN-- This is the blank space from the left edge of the paper to the first character, measured in characters at 10 CPI. Default value of 10 gives you a left margin of 1". Range is 0-140. To determine the correct value, divide the desired size in inches by 10.
     TEXT WIDTH-- This is the number of characters and spaces that the system will allow to be typed across the page, at 10 CPI. Default value of 65 gives you 6 1/2" of text. With a default left margin of 10 and 65 characters of text,this leaves a right margin of 10 also,(65 text + 10 left = 75;page width 85 - 75 = 10 right margin).Range is 20-160.To determine the correct value, divide the desired width in inches by 10.
     DOUBLE SPACE-- If you leave a default value NO, text will be single spaced.If changed to YES, text will be double spaced.

CONFIGURATION SUBSYSTEM:

     LOWER CASE VIDEO-- If you have a lower case adapter(chip) you can see true upper and lower case on the screen. Change the the answer to YES.
     LOWER CASE KEYBOARD-- A standard Apple II has upper case only.
     "ONE WIRE SHIFT KEY-- If your system has this modification, you can use the Shift key to get upper case, rather than ESC.
     PRINTER SLOT-- Normal slot answer is 1. If your slot is different change the value.
     PRINTER DRIVER PROGRAM-- If you have the Driver Program Disk answer YES to this value.
     VIDEO SLOT-- This command allows you to tell the system which slot your 80-column board is in. If you don't have a 80-column board default answer to 0.
     VIDEO DRIVER PROGRAM-- If you have answered the question on the driver disk as YES then load the driver disk at boot time.

TO SAVE CONFIGURATIONS-- Type 3 on the functions menu or press RETURN and you will save  a file that contains the configuration data for your own system. This file is called SYS OPS (System Options). You save this file on any data diskette, so the system options are recorded on it and automatically registered by the system when you use the disk.


UNFORMATTED FILER SUBSYSTEM:
     The difference between a formatted file and an unformatted file is, a formatted file is considered a complete unit,whereas in an unformatted file,each line is considered a separate unit. This allows you to manipulate the text in an unformatted file.You can save, load, or transfer to a formatted file any amount of text- from one line to an entire file. Construct or Edit files you've created using other software,such as, Visicalc,or even BASIC programs.

     A.TRANSFER ENTIRE FILE-- This command allows you to tell the system whether you want to save, load, or merge entire files, or only parts. The default is YES. 
     B.INCLUDE MARKERS-- This option is used when dealing with only part of a file. In order to save, load, or transfer part of a file, you must define the portion of text with markers -- either special character inserted at the left margin or actual text (any amount beginning at the left margin). This option allows you to tell the system whether you want the markers included in the file or not. The default is YES, which means they will be included. 

DEFINING TEXT WITH MARKERS:
     There are two types of markers: special characters (such as $$ or any you choose) and actual text. Just make sure that whatever you use is not found at the left margin elsewhere in the text. Since the system only looks for markers at the left margin.

     USING CHARACTERS AS MARKERS-- If you use special characters, you have to put them at the left margin, perhaps on a blank line above and below the lines with the text you wanted.

     USING TEXT AS MARKERS-- If you are using the text as a marker, you'd have to use at least the first few letters of the beginning of the line.

     USING BOTH TEXT AND CHARACTERS AS MARKERS-- No law says that starting and ending markers have to be the same. In an application, preface a single-digit number with zeros, or be sure to follow the digit with a character (though using both is best)
            EXAMPLE:
             /001/
             Ralph Hendersen
             1642 Riverview
             St.Louis, MO 11111
             //

The system reads an entire line at a time, therefore if you just used /2, it wouldn't know if you meant /2 or /27 or /2658430. It takes the first /2 it sees, so if the numbers are not listed "sequentially" in the file, you will get the first one that begins with /2.

     SAVING PART OF A FILE-- You can save as much or as little of a text file as you want using range markers. You can use characters or text as markers.
            First change TRANSFER ENTIRE FILE to NO. Then type 3 twice to select and execute the save function, enter the file name and press RETURN. This time the prompt STARTING MARKER will come up hit RETURN,then up comes the ENDING MARKER prompt.Answer the prompt and press RETURN. This will save the defined part of the file. 

     LOADING PART OF A FILE-- The process of defining the text and answering the starting and ending marker prompts is exactly the same as for saving.

     INSERTING UNFORMATTED FILE-- This command tells the system to insert the unformatted file (or portions) at the location of the cursor in the formatted file. Text will begin to merge at the cursor position.
            To transfer an entire file- load the formatted file and position the cursor at the desired point of merge. Answer A.TRANSFER ENTIRE FILE - YES, type 5 twice, and execute INSERT UNFORMATTED FILE. When directory and prompt come to the screen,enter number and press RETURN.

            To transfer part of a file. If using markers, place in text and save the file with the markers. Load the formatted file you want to merge text with, position the cursor at the desired point of merge,(and above instructions). Answer "A" as NO,type 5 twice. When directory appears,enter number of the unformatted file, press RETURN.
