			The SySop's Underground Network
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SySop's Underground Network is a group of SySops who, in the effort to 
further advance the state of underground computing, have joined together 
to form a network.  We will not be involving 'warez type boards', if that is 
your thing, quit reading now.  We will concentrate instead on the 
informational boards.  Text files, P/H/A/C/V bases, and good 'underground' 
activities.  This questionair is to determine if you and your board fit our 
guidlines for admission.
