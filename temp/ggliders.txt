>=========<

SPARTAN IS A GAME SIMILAR TO JOUST.
THE OBJECT IS TO KILL THE SEAHORSES
AND RECOVER THE DIAMONDS THEY ARE
CARRYING.  TO KILL THEM YOU MUST HIT
THEM WHEN YOUR SWORD IS HIGHER THAN
THEIR TAILS.  AFTER KILLING THEM SOME
COLORED BUBBLES WILL FLOAT AROUND FOR
A WHILE AND THEN TURN INTO A DIAMOND.
RUN OVER THE DIAMOND TO PICK IT UP.
THE OTHER CREATURES ARE THE TURTLE,
WHO CHANGES DIAMONDS INTO HORSES BUT
POSES NO DANGER TO YOU; THE SHARK, WHO
KILLS YOU AND CHANGES DIAMONDS BACK TO
HORSES; THE JELLYFISH, WHO KILLS YOU
BUT DOES NOTHING TO THE DIAMONDS OR
THE SEAHORSES; AND THE EEL, WHO KILLS
YOU AND DOES NOTHING TO THE DIAMONDS
OR THE SEAHORSES.
