
PHANTASIE (Map-Maze Adventure for one or more players)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe
Requirements: One disk drive


     Evil times have befallen the once peaceful island country of western Gelnor. Led by the mighty sorcerer Nikademus, monsters and the dreaded Black Knights plunder at will. But newly arrived on Gelnor, you are amazed to find a quest worthy of your mettle. Now all that remains is to gather a party of equally valiant souls and rid the land of its plague.

     Borrowing from such favorites as "Questron" and "Wizardry", SSI's "Phantasie" offers advanced character development, sixteen 20x26 half-screen terrain maps, and ten 16x16 dungeons. Each party may include six members drawn from a roster of nearly forty player-created characters. Several parties may be active at the same time, spread through different regions of the island.

     Whereas in games like "Ultima" practically all the action occurs on the map; "Phantasie" uses its maps purely as locators. Most action, such as purchases, training, reading scrolls, etc. is via text screens. A simple, minimum animation heros vs. monsters picture symbolizes combat.

    "Phantasie" is a major, well documented adventure featuring one of the more complex scenarios (even the gods get into the action). Multi-party capability facilitates involving several players in the quest; and exceptionally flexible character management makes it easy to identify with your heros. As tough as it is addictive, your "Phantasie" awaits you.


Available from SSI: 883 Stierlin Road, Building A-200, Mountain View, CA 94043-1983. (415) 964-1200. $39.95
