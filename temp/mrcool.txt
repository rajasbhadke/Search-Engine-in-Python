             * GAME PLAY *
             *************

    MOVE YOUR VEHICLE ON THE ELEVATOR
TO THE DESIRED MINE SHAFT.  ENTER THE
CAVE.  AS YOU MOVE, YOU DIG THROUGH THE
DIRT.  YOU MOVE FASTER IN PATHWAYS THAT
ARE ALREADY CLEARED.  YOU MAY SHOOT THE
MONSTERS, WHO ATTEMPT TO HAMPER YOUR
PROGRESS.  HOWEVER, THEY WILL REAPPEAR
IN A FEW SECONDS.  THERE ARE EIGHT
DIAMONDS IN EACH LEVEL.  YOU MUST TAKE
EACH DIAMOND, PROCESS IT AND BRING IT
OUT OF THE MINE.  AS YOU TAKE A
DIAMOND, IT WILL FOLLOW BEHIND YOU --
KINDA LIKE SERPENTINE.  THE MONSTERS
CAN EAT YOUR DIAMONDS ONLY WHEN YOU ARE
CARRYING THEM.  BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE
DIAMONDS IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE MINE!
YOU MUST PROCESS THEM FIRST.  THE
PROCESSING BOX LOOKS LIKE THIS:

!-------------! BRING DIAMONDS
!             !
!             !  <<<---
!  <>      #  !  --->>>
!             !
!        !----!  TAKE DIAMONDS
!        !
!(WAITING!   <> = DIAMOND STORAGE
!   AREA)!    # = NUMBER OF DIAMONDS IN
!        !        STORAGE AREA
!--------!

     !
     !
   \ ! /
    \ /

EXIT & LEAVE
  DIAMONDS



   TO TAKE THE DIAMONDS OUT OF THE MINE
FOR THE MOST POINTS, YOU SHOULD QUEUE
THEM UP; THAT IS, MOVE ALL EIGHT TO
THE STORAGE AREA AND THEN MOVE THEM
OUT.  THE UPPER RIGHT IS AN ENTRY/EXIT
AREA. DIAMONDS CAN BE BROUGHT IN OR
REMOVED FROM THIS AREA.  THE BOTTOM IS
AN EXIT TO LEAVE THE DIAMONDS IN THE
PROCESSING AREA.

   YOU WILL FIND TWO "U" SHAPED, HEAVY
BORDERED SQUARES.  THESE ARE
TELEPORTERS.  MOVING INTO ONE WILL
TRANSPORT YOU TO THE OTHER.

   IF YOU COMPLETE FIVE DUNGEONS WITH
LESS THAN FIVE DIAMONDS LOST AND STILL
ARE ALIVE, THE GAME WILL GIVE YOU A
PASSWORD.  USE THE PASSWORD LATER TO
SKIP BEGINNING LEVELS. THERE ARE SEVEN
LEVELS IN ALL.

        >>>> SPECIAL NOTES <<<<

*> A KEY IN THE LATTER DUNGEONS IS TO
BE PROCESSED LIKE A REGULAR DIAMOND.

*> MONSTERS ARE SHY WHEN YOU HAVE A KEY

*> THERE ARE SPECIAL TRANSPORTERS THAT
REQUIRE A KEY -- THEY WILL
TRANSPORT YOU TO ANOTHER AREA OF THE
SHAFT.
