 I. 'Last Ninja/IIgs Deprotect (from COMPUTIST #67, by Paul Giguere)

Use any disk copier (e.g. Diversi-Copy, etc.) to copy the ORIGINAL
diskette. Ignore any problem with Block 1599 ($63F). Put the ORIGINAL
away.

To simplify Block edits, move the file NINJA.SYS16 from the COPY to
/RAM5 or an empty diskette.

Start your favorite Block Editor utility (e.g. Block Warden, Block Work,
Prosel-16's ZAP, etc.).

On /RAM5 (or wherever you moved NINJA.SYS16) do a SEARCH for the bytes
...

20 00 FB C4 00 00 90

They should show up somewhere in a low-numbered Block (e.g. Blocks 3-16)
on an empty diskette. I found them in Block 8.

At byte offset location $174 ...

Change 20 00 FB C4 00 00 90  to  EA EA EA EA EA EA 80

In the same Block, at byte offset location $1BA 

Change 90 C0  to  80 05

Save the changed Block.



 II. 'Last Ninja Hard Disk Mod (from COMPUTIST #69, by Top Gun)

Continuing from the Deprotect ...

On /RAM5 (or wherever you moved NINJA.SYS16) do a SEARCH for the Text
...

/The.Last.Ninja

I found the entry in Block 115 starting at byte offset location $0CA.

Change the "/The" part of the entry to "1/HD". The entire entry should
now read ...

1/HD.Last.Ninja

(In hexadecimal ASCII bytes this would be ...

31 2F 48 44 2E 4C 61 73 74 2E 4E 69 6E 6A 61)

Save the changed Block.


On a hard disk volume create the folder  HD.Last.Ninja .

Copy the changed version of NINJA.SYS16 to the HD.Last.Ninja folder.

>From your COPY diskette, copy all of the "DATA ..." files (e.g. DATAA,
DATAB, etc.) to the HD.Last.Ninja folder. 


Tried out the game-- walked around, did a fight, Saved & Loaded-- it
seems to work fine.
