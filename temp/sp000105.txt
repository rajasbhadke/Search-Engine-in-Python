"Security, the chief pretence of civilization, cannot exist where the
worst of dangers, the danger of poverty, hangs over everyone's head,
and where the alleged protection of our persons from violence is only
an accidental result of the existence of a police force whose real
business is to force the poor man to see his children starve whilst
idle people overfeed pet dogs with the money that might feed and
clothe them."

					- Bernard Shaw, from his play
					- "Major Barbara"

"A government with the policy to rob Peter to pay Paul 
can be assured of the support of Paul"
