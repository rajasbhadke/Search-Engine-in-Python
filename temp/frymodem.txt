     AN EFFECTIVE MODEM WEAPON, ESPECIALLY ON CROSSBAR PHONE SYSTEMS. (IT
WILL STILL OPERATE ON ESS BUT YOU WILL KILL PHONE SERVICE TO YOUR PREFIX FOR
A FEW HOURS, AND EVERYONE TALKING WILL BE CUT OFF ON YOUR PREFIX AND THE ONE
YOU CALLED) WHAT IS THIS DEVICE?  IT'S A TESLA COIL.
 
     THE TESLA COIL WHEN PROPERLY USED WILL GENERATE LITRALLY THOUSANDS OF
VOLTS AT VERY LOW AMPERAGE. (JUST THE RIGHT CURRENT TO BAKE SILICON CHIP
COOKIES.)
 
---> SET UP
 
1. DISCONNECT ALL PHONES FROM YOUR LINE.  DISCONNECT ANSWERING DEVICES AND
   ANY DATA-TRANSMISSION DEVICES.
 
2. RUN A PRELIMINARY TEST ON THE COIL AND DISCONNECT NEARBY GROUNDED
   OBJECTS.  (LAMPS STEREOS, TV'S ETC...)
 
3. CONNECT ONE PHONE THAT YOU SEE FIT TO SUBJECT. (IT USUALLY DOES NOT
   DESTROY PHONES, BUT I HAVE SEEN THEM MELT OFF WALLS.)
 
4. CONNECT IRON OR STEEL BALLS TO THE GREEN AND RED WIRES OF YOUR CONNNECTED
   PHONE (THESE ARE THE LINE WIRES THAT GO INTO THE WALL.)  L1 AND L2
   TERMINALS OF YOUR PHONE.
 
5. PUT ON A PAIR OF THICK RUBBER GLOVES (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!)
 
6. CHARGE COIL TO AT LEAST 10,000 VOLTS.  AN IDEAL SETTING IS AROUND 18
   TO 19 THOUSAND, BUT 10 WILL JUMP BELLS LINE SURGE PROTECTORS.
 
7. HOLD METAL BALLS IN YOUR LEFT HAND.  (MAKE SURE THEY DON'T TOUCH EACH
   OTHER) WHEN THE COIL IS FULLY CHARGED, CLIP THE STEEL BALL CONNECTED TO
   THE RED WIRE TO THE BASE OF THE TESLA COIL AND HOLD THE OTHER METAL BALL
   AS FAR AWAY FROM THE COIL AS YOU CAN.
 
8. DIAL THE OFFENDING MODEMS NUMBER.
 
9. WHEN CONNECTED, MOVE THE METAL OBJECT CONNECTED TO THE GREEN WIRE WITHIN
   2 FEET OF THE COILS TOP.
 
-> DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE LITTLE BOLTS OF ELECTRICITY SHOOTING FROM THE TOP
   OF THE COIL...
 
10. WITHIN 3 SECONDS A HUGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING WILL SHOOT FORTH AT THE PHONE
    FROM THE HAND YOU ARE HOLDING THE BALLS IN.  [MISSING PART WHEN
    RECEIVED] THE GREEN CONNECTED METAL BALL. (HOLD ON TIGHT CAUSE IT'LL
    FEEL LIKE LOADS OF ANTS!) YOU WILL IMMEDIATLY HEAR MANY STRANGE
    OCCILATIONS TO THE CARRIER ON THE PHONE.  THE LAST NOISE YOU WILL HEAR
    IS A POP! FROM THE PHONE.  (THAT IS THE LAST CRY OF AGONY AS IT SHUTS
    DOWN.)
 
   CROSSBAR JUST DISCONNECTS.
 
 
   GUARANTEED TO FRY THE MODEM, THE COMPUTER AND ANY PERIPHERALS. OR ANYONE
WHO ANSWERS THE PHONE!  ALL DAMAGE IS UN-REPAIRABLE.  INCLUDING LIVES!
