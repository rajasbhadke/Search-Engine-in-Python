   DIU is a ProDOS utility that will allow you to take an inventory of your
 ProDOS disks and create a TXT file which could be used by AppleWorks.
 
   DIU will first ask for the Slot & Drive of the diskette to be inventoried.
 This is selected using the light-bar selector. Next DIU will ask were the
 information should be displayed (Printer, Screen, or Text file). With this
 version 1.0B of DIU, output to text file is the only valid option. Selecting
 Text file will promt for the FULL pathname of the text file to be created.
 Full pathname means that you must specify the Volume name as well as the
 filename [ex. /MYDISK/NEWFILE]. DIU will then read the directory from the
 selected slot and drive and create a TXT file on the specified pathname.
 The same TXT file may be used again for different disk. Each disk inventory 
 will be appended to the previous one if the same name is used.
 
   To create an AppleWorks Data Base file from the TXT file, follow the
 following instructions.
 
      1. From the Main Menu select option 1, "Add files to Desktop."
      2. Next, select option 4, "Make a new file for the Data Base."
      3. Select option 2, "Make a new file from a text (ASCII) file."
      4. Enter 9 to the question "How many categories per record?"
      5. Enter the complete pathname of the file created with DIU.
         [ex. /MYDISK/NEWFILE]
 
   After Appleworks has read the file, it will as for the name of the newfile.
 This is the name of the Data Base file.
 
   There it is! Appleworks now has a Data Base file with an inventory of your
 ProDOS disk(s).
 
   Now to fix-up the file.
 
   Press OA-N for "Rename categories." The categories should be changed to the
 following:
 
      CATEGORY01 = Pathname             CATEGORY06 = Modified Time
      CATEGORY02 = Filename             CATEGORY07 = Create Date
      CATEGORY03 = Type (filetype)      CATEGORY08 = Create Time
      CATEGORY04 = Blks (Blocks)        CATEGORY09 = Endfile (Bytes)
      CATEGORY05 = Modified Date
 
   Press OA-L to "Change record layout."
 Delete "Modified Time" & "Create Time."
 "Filename" should be set at 15 spaces, since this is the maximum number of
 charaters allowed in a ProDOS filename.
 "Type" should be set to 3 spaces.
 "Modified Date" & "Create Date" should both be set at 9 spaces.
