This contains the complete set of documentation recieved by game
testers for Micro Fun's new game, Caribbean Quest. At the time of
its arrival to me, one side of two sides was written. If any more
documentation is released, please add to this file if I have not
already done so. Please keep in mind that this adventure may not
be released at all; all depending on the reviews of us testers.

Caribbean Quest

The Object:

You must recover stolen items from the bad guy. To do this you
use your simulated modem to gain access to other computers and
get information needed to fulfill your mission.

Once you think you have the data you need, you must type "GO
AIRPORT" to start your adventure.

The adventure is pseudo-real time. You must arrive and work to
finish your task while avoiding guards making their rounds. The
clock is always on the screen. Be in the wrong place when a guard
arrives and you are caught. Your mission fails.




Simulated Modem

With the simulated modem you can pass phone numbers--have them
'dialed' and determine if another computer answers. If it does,
you can then connect and get into the other computer.

To use the modem, you must write a Basic program. Its first two
lines MUST be:

10 A% = 0: B% = 0: N% = 0
20 MODEM = 19203

Then if you write:

30 A% = 516: B% = 265
40 FOR N = 1 TO 9999
45 N% = N
50 CALL MODEM
60 NEXT N


This will try all numbers from 516 265 0000 to 516 265 9999.

If a number is another computer is reached, the number and a
prompt will be displayed.

              516 265 0046 # <- flashing

If you answer the prompt with a "Control-C" within 10 seconds,
you will connect to the computer. If you do not input "Control-C"
you will return to your Basic program and it will continue to
run.

Once connected, you must input a password. You get 5 tries before
you are disconnected and put back into Basic. The articles give
clues to passwords.


By the way, there is also a 'HELP' screen. You get it by typing
'HELP' and return.

NOTE: This is a modified version of DOS 3.3. Many commands are
      locked out. Some are added, i.e., HELP, GO AIRPORT.

This disk must remain write protected. If you write to it, all is
lost.

When you get to side 2 you may stop the clock by typing 'H' and
return (H for hold). To restart, press the space bar and return.
(This works on side 1 also)

When you are in your room, you may advance the clock by typing
'A' and return.

To save game, type 'SAVE'.

To load a saved game, type 'LOAD'.

YOURTOWN, U.S.A.: Today the owner of Tailspin Airlines revealed
the details of the latest hijacking of one of its small passenger
aircraft.

     Jack Crashright, the pilot and owner of the company, said he
was forced to fly to a small uncharted island off the coast.

     After forcing all passengers to leave the plane and disabl-
ing its navigational equipment, the hijacker forced Jack to take
off from the island. Only his great skill and resourcefulness
permitted him to find his way back without any navigational aids.

     A search has been launched for this remote Caribbean island
and the lost passengers, but as in past cases of this nature,
there is little hope of finding them alive.



HERTOWN, U.S.A.: Mrs. Winifred P. Windom has reported three
priceless antiques stolen from her private collection. The three
pieces, still not identified, are believed to have been stolen by
Abdul E. Zarwati. Zarwati and his constant companion Zelda, with
her dogs Zulu and Zip were seen leaving the airport bound for
Zarwati Island, where the summer palace is located.

     While there is no proof Zarwati is the thief, he is a col-
lector with what is believed to be a vast private collection of
priceless trivia.

     The authorities are powerless without proof, but it is
thought that a 'soldier of fortune' has been retained to recover
the items.


P.S.  Be sure target disk is inited
with volume #001 before remerging
with disk rigger!  Disk splitter will
work fine without any extra work.
