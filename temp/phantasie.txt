Classes
-------

FIGHTERS perform best in combat.  Humans, dwarves, and random creatures make good fighters.

MONKS are average in combat, but they know combat spells and have some thieving skills.  Humans, elves, and hobbits do well.

PRIESTS are fair in combat, but they have many defensive and healing spells.  Humans and dwarves make good rangers.

RANGERS are very good in combat, and they know some priestly spells.  Humans and dwarves make good rangers.

THIEVES are good with traps, locks, and hidden items; but they perform poorly in combat.  Their fighting skills are helped by the fact that they can hit a monster no matter where it is, due to their stealth.  Hobbits, gnomes, and some of the random creatures make excellent thieves.

WIZARDS are chiefly spellcasters.  While poor in hand-to-hand combat, they know many offensive spells and are extremely important in encounters with monsters.  Humans and elves do the job best.

Five attributes are generated by the program.  The value of each attribute ranges from 3 to 22 and the average depends upon the characters race and class.

Strength (STR) refers to physical strength, and it is crucial for hand-to-hand combat.  Fighters need a lot of strength to wield high-level combat equipment.

Intelligence (INT) is the mental prowess necessary for learning and casting spells.  Wizards, priests, and monks must have a high intelligence.

Dexterity (DEX) means physical agility in handling weapons and conjuring spells, and especially in dodging attacks from monsters.  Each profession needs good dexterity, especially fighters and spell casters.

Constitution (CON) refers to a character's endurance, and it affects the number of hit points a character can have.

charisma (CHA) means having a charming personality and good looks.  A character's charisma affects the price of training and spells (one further reason that many low-charisma random characters must pay more).

A character's race and class affect the individual attributes.  Each attribute can have a value ranging from 3 to 22.  The charts below show, to some degree, how these characteristics interact with each other:

There are 11 towns:

Town Menu

A) Armory
G) Guild
M) Mystic
N) Inn
B) ank
L) Road out of town

G)uild is where characters are generated and then formed into parties. As many as 37 characters can be generated, but a party can have no more than 6 adventures.

Playing Hint:  The following roster is recommended for a first-time party:

2 Spellcasters (wizards, monks) - humans or elves
1 Healer (priest, ranger) - Human or dwarf
1 Thiefly type (thief, monk) - Gnome, Halfling, or random creature
2 combatants (fighters,rangers) - humans, dwarves, or random creatures

Playing Hint: Once generated, adventurers cannot get training in combat or spellcasting, nor can they leave the Guild for other parts of the town, until AFTER they have joined a party.

Playing Hint:  The last three characters - Fire, Water, and Earth - are the elementals that spellcasters may call into combat, using the Summon Elemental spell.  They live in a non-material plane of existence.  Be sure to make a note of each character's Guild number since the program will require the number, not name, when he or she is added to a party and when a game is continued.
 

Playing Hint:  If you plan to use the Summon Elemental spell during your next adventure, you should add the elementals to the party while you're still at the Guild.

S) pells tells you which new spells can be learned by the character and how much they will cost.  The spell will be identified by its number, not its name.  If there are no number after POSSIBLE SPELLS; then no new spells can be learned at that time.

T) raining is the most effective way for a character to go up a level.  When you enter the training arena, you will be told how many experience points are required and how much the training will cost.

Playing Hint:  Characters must be carrying gold piece to pay for learning new spells and for training.  With new party members, this means going to the bank and making a withdrawl then returning to the guild.  A Party can carry up to 65000 gold pieces.  A bank acount can hold up to 65000 gold pieces.

A)rmory - figure it out(duh!).

M)ystic gives an overalls score for the party.

In)n is where characters can have their hit points and magic restored to their maximum limit.  Inns located in towns are free, and each stay lasts about tow weeks.  In addition, independent inns are located throughout the Isle of Geinor, an they cost 250 gps(plus tax) per stay.

Age starts affecting character's attributes as they reach their declining years.  Each race has a different lifespan: elves live about 3000 years; dwarves and gnomes about 200 years; humans, about 80 years; and the others; about 40 to 50 years.

HP) self explanatory

Magic show points available for spellcasting.

Skills are done in a percentage..Attack 48 means a 48% chance of hitting a monster.

confusion(#21 - #24) makes it difficult for monsters to use magic.  Progressive.  Confusion 4 is so effective it's victims can't cast at all.
