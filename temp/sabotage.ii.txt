                              SABOTAGE II: REVENGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



     This is a very simple game to play.  It reverses the roles of the classic
Sabotage. You are now flying a helicopter, and must land paratroopers on the
gun bunkers to blow them up.  It takes 4 paratroopers to blow up 1 bunker.
After having done so, you will get your 4 paratroopers back.  You have 96 men
to start with and must blow up 96 bunkers to advance to the next level. 
There are 4 levels of play, each successive level being slightly harder than
the previous.

Scoring is as follows:
10 points: Land a man on the black strip next to bunker
100 ponits: Blow up a bunker
1000 points: Advance a level

     The damage bar indicates how much more damage you can absorb before
dying.  You only get one helicopter!

Button 0 will start the game and also drop paratroopers.
Button 1 will pause the game.

     In between levels you will see a blue mini-screen.  This is to allow you
to regain your brain.

If you are dead, a red screen will appear.  Button 0 restarts.
