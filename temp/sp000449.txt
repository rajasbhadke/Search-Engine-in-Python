     KALININGRAD AUTHORITIES STOPPED THE ACTION OF GREENS

     August 19,  1994 (EDI) Kaliningrad,  The  authorities  of
Kaliningrad/Koenigsberg  stopped the non-violent international
environmental action of Baltic Greens.  The bus with 36 people
     from Lithuanian Green Movement,
Lithuanian Universities, ECODEFENSE! (Kaliningrad/Koenigsberg)
and other environmentalists was stopped before  Russian-Polish
border  (in  Kaliningrad  region).  The  bus  went  along  the
Lithuanian and  Kaliningrad  coast  of  the  Baltic  Sea.  The
participants  of the action went out on the coast time-to-time
and collected coastal garbage. The plan of the action included
similar  walk  along  the  Lithuanian,  Kaliningrad and Polish
coast.  After it the plan included to bring  the  garbage  and
give   it  to  the  authorities:  Lithuanian  garbage  to  the
lithuanian authorities,  the Russian garbage  to  the  Russian
authorities, the Polish garbage to the Polish authorities.
     The authorities said the action organizers need pay about
1.300.000 Rub (about $650) for the trip in Poland where Polish
Greens  waited  the   bus   for   the   action   continuation.
Participants  don't  had  this money and the official faces of
the  Kaliningrad  administration  don't  helped   (Before   it
lithuanian  authorities  helped  to  the  organizers,  in  the
similar case).
     Action participants will present the packs with the coast
garbage to the administrations of the coastal regions.

Ian Anthony  (ed.)  THE  FUTURE  OF  THE DEFENCE INDUSTRIES IN
CENTRAL  AND  EASTERN  EUROPE  Sipri  Research   Report   No.7
Oxford/Stockholm, University Press/SIPRI, 1994, 142 p.

The report  examines  the  defence  industries  in Central and
Eastern Europe as they attempt to restructure in the  wake  of
changes  brought about by the end of the cold war and downward
trends in both military expenditure and arms control  exports.
Separate chapters examine the developing military doctrines in
Central and Eastern Europe, the trend in military expenditure,
the   nature   of  the  efforts  to  restructure  the  defence
industries,  the  international   dimensions   of   industrial
restructuring and the role of arms exports.  Finally, the book
attemps to relate the on-going process of  defence  industrial
restructuring   into   the  context  of  an  overall  economic
structural adjustment that is now underway  in  the  countries
under study.  Just a personal matter of terminology: I believe
it is better to speak about  'military'  industry  instead  of
'defence'  industry,  especially as a large part of this study
is devoted to Eastern European international arms exports  and
the  'defence'  priorities/intentions of the customers are not
always clear.

(continuation from N24) Therefore we give advice  to  all  who
     need scientific
support in dealing with environmental problems and  conflicts.
We give literature references and help to build up information
networks for organizations.  If the ones who ask our help  are
private people,  grass root organizations and citizens' action
groups or if the probelm is from outstanding  public  interest
we try to do the work for free - as far as possible.
     Therefore we take part in research with our own  projects
(see  below).  We  try  hard  to work in fields that are of an
topical scientific interest and to use our work in a way  that
is of interest for relevant groups of society and not only for
the  scientific  community   itself.   We   support   critical
scientists  and academics and give students the chance to take
part in our projects to get to know something  about  existing
alternatives to the traditional scientific framework.
     Following a selection of topical projects:
     * Environmental consciousness of foreign people.
     * Electromagnetic  fields.  Advices  for  the  public and
strategies for mediation.
     * History  of  nature  and  technics.  Case  studies  and
comparisons in history and presence.
     * Ecology and time-system.
     * Saving energy.
     * Waste  avoidance.  Conseptional  reflections  and  case
studies.
     * Food-stuffs and genetics.
     * Climate change and its implications.
     * Traffic and environment.
