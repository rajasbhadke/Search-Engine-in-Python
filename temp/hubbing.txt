General rules for hubbing:  April 28th 1993


RELIABLITY:
The first thing we look for in a hub is a reliable board. We understand 
about crashes, but just not as often as Funknet sends out a nodelist. :> 
Also, if you can't decide if you want to keep the board up or not, please 
don't ask for the job. We want a reliable person as well as a reliable 
board.

ACCEPTANCE:
We accept parttime boards in FunkNet, so if you don't want to hub to one
of these, please don't ask for the job.

MONEY:
There is no money or rewards involved in hubbing for FunkNet, but the 
appreciation is bountiful. 

AGE:
We can't let anyone under 21 hub for FunkNet, as we have conferences that
are of adult nature. Any hub that is sending one of these conferences to
anyone under 21, please remove it. If not, you will get your hand severely
smacked, and maybe have a few broken knuckles. :>

HELPING:
It is preferrable if the hub would help their own node get setup, and with 
any problems that may arise. If for some reason you can't do this, then we 
will be here to help. 

FEEDS:
No FunkNet SysOp will feed a non-FunkNet board any echo without approval
from the administration.

I know I've missed something, so if you can think of anymore RULES, please
let me know. HA! There will probably be more later. :>
