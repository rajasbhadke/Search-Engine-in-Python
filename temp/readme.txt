  If the date on this list is more than 30 days old, a new list is probably
available. See below for ways to obtain the latest list. Please stay up-to-date
with what's happening in Mid-Michigan BBSing.
  The listing of a BBS does not necessarily indicate an endorsement for it.
  If a BBS is found to promote uploading virui or copyrighted files, hacking, or
other means of immorality, it will be immediately be removed from the list.

                             USBBS NATIONAL BBS LIST

  Selected mid-Michigan BBS'S will now be listed in the USBBS National BBS List.
To be listed, a system must be running full-time, be somewhat file-oriented, have
at least 100 megabytes devoted to the BBS, and the sysop must provide his or her
real name. If your BBS meets these criteria, the necessary information will be
submitted to the list. Boards that are submitted will be noted in the list. If
you feel your board should be listed or it is listed and shouldn't be, write me
at one of the addresses given below.
