  Double Check, the first program to double check codes found by any hack program that writes text files.  I wrote this program because hack programs usually aren't very accurate.  Use Double Check and save your fingers from being worn to the knuckles punching in numbers that are invalid.  Double Check uses an Apple-Cat in slot 2 and text files.
  The new version is exactly the same except that when it asks for the codes file name, if you press RETURN or '?' it will catalog the disk. 
  Double Check will take the specified text file that contains the codes to be tested, sort, check, and then write the valid codes.  Operation of Double Check is simple:  It will first ask for the access number (without dashes and either 7 or 11 digits).  It will then ask for the text file name that contains the codes to be checked (after you enter the name, it will verify the file name). It will then ask for the desired output (Printer in slot 1, Disk, or the screen).  If you specify Disk, when completed, it will write the valid codes in a text file called 'x.VERIFY' where x is the original file name.  Double Check will the ask if you want to change the parameters.  The parameters that you can change are: modify the destination number (default is 208-384-5660 which is Compu-Serve in Boise, Idaho).  :You can change the delay between the calls. This is because phones/modems hang up at a different rate and if your modem isn't hung up, you can possibly make a 'garbage call' to some-where on the other side of the country and you could get a charge because it might dial direct.  The timer can be set from 10-800 (default 20).  :The pause for dial tone can be changed also.  The setting can be from 1000-8000 (default 2000). :The pause for answer is the wait for the line to connect to the service.  the setting can be from 1000-10000 (default 3800).  :The last parameter is the validation routine delay.  The way this works is that after it dials in the numbers, it waits for 'x' time, then checks to see if it is valid or not.  The problem with some of the 'fast' hackers is that they try to validate the code before the 'invalid code' message has started or before the line is connected to the destination number.  The settng is from 100-2000 (default 400).   

  After dialing has started, pressing 'space' will hang up the phone, and go into pause mode.  When you want to restart press 'space' to restart dialing. If ESC is pressed, you will go into the exit menu.  Here you have 3 choices: Resume with the dialing, Continue (this means that it will abort the dialing/ check mode and jump to the final writing, or in other words, act as if it has checked all the codes), or Quit which will abort everything.

  I hope this program is as usefull to you as it is to me.  Also, if you encounter any errors or modifications in the program, leave me (THE W0RM) a msg. on one of the larger Catsend lines and I'll update Double Check.
