By abolishing all private property communism makes me even more
dependent on others, on generality or totality[of society],
and, in spite of it's attacks on State, it intends to establish
it's own State,...a state of affairs which paralyzes my freedom
to act and exerts sovereign authority over me. Communism is
rightly indignant about the wrongs which I suffer at the hands
of individual proprietors, but the power which it will put
into the hands of the total society is even more terrible."
