     Except for needing to supply information from the manual at the
start, BC is not copy-protected. A good defeat for the protection (one
of several) was supplied by Sky Phantom in Computist #73.

     You copy the diskette and use a block editor to change a byte. You
want to find 20 90 35 20 E0 32 20 DE AA 60, and change _20_ DE AA to
_AD_ DE AA. Probably, you will find the byte to change at byte location
$0FF in Block $3D8 of your copy.  

     A method for placing BC on hard disk was described by Robin
Locksley in Computist #86; however, it is supposed to work for GS/OS
5.04. It does not work for System 6.0.1. (The game crashes.)

     So far, the closest thing to "installing" the game on a System 6
hard disk is to copy the files to a folder. To run the game, you copy
the folder contents to /RAM5 and boot /RAM5.
