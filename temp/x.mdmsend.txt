			X.MDMSEND

                       Version 1.0

Purpose
---------------------
At the request of the Phantom, this Macos external was written.  It's purpose was to provide a way for Macos programmers to directly send a string to their modem without Macos touching it.  Than, to have the external place the appropriate result code in location $0A.

Syntax
---------------------
The routine can be called like this....

      use "(drive specificier):XMDMSEND",[string]

where drive specificer is any legal drive spec. and string is any modem command of unlimited length.  Please note that the use command for this routine MUST be on it's own line since the RETURN character is what the program uses to determine the end-of-string.

Compatiblity
--------------------
This routine was originally written to run under Apple's Super Serial Card; however, it should run fine on the GS modem port as well.  If there is any problem with it on a GS, contact me; I can write it for the GS.

An Example
--------------------
After struggling with many commands whose syntax was unclear even after an example, I feel obliged to place in this documentation an actual example...

Let's say that you wish to hook your board into a network, but you had no way of dialing the nearest site from within Macos.  I am assuming that the nearest net site is at (312) 555-4668, and I am assuming that the external has been installed in drive G.

    use "g:X.MDMSEND",ATDT1-312-555-4668

That would do it.  Please note that there are no quote marks around the command being passed to the modem.
