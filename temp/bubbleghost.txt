
Bubble Ghost from Accolade

REQUIREMENTS:
512k Apple//GS
3.5" Disk copier
3.5" Disk editor

  To remove the annoying "What level is this?" question (pirate protection)
make the follow these easy steps:

1.  Make a copy of the Bubble Ghost game disk
2.  Make the following edit to the copy only

(rel block 78, rel bytes $9B74, $9B77, $9BA2 for Block Warden)

BLK   BYTE  FROM         TO
------------------------------------
$17A  $174  AD 00 00     9C 00 00
      $177  F0 2E        80 2E
      $1A2  22 00 00 00  AF 00 00 00

3.  Write the block back to the copy
4.  Play off the newly deprotected copy

Once again, the whole requestor screen/routine is totaly bypassed!  However the
program was not hard disk compatible!  I then set out fix this little problem.
  All files were being loaded like this: /Bubble/WAVE.  I thought I could use
the ProDOS 16 "1/" to make the program accept the current device.  I now had to
change all the "/Bubble" to something, so I came up with "1/Ghost" so Bubble
Ghost will load ALL needed files off the current volume in the subdirectory
GHOST.  Use a copy of Bubble Ghost for the following steps:

  Make the edit From "/Bubble" (2F 42 75 62 62 6C 65 in hex)
                  To "1/Ghost" (31 2F 47 68 6F 73 74 in hex)

at ALL the following locations:

Any block editor             Block Warden ([F]ollow /BUBBLE/BUBBLE.SYS16)
Block    Byte                Rel Block    Rel Bytes
---------------------------------------------------
$129     $9C                 47           $5C9C
         $B8                              $5CB8
         $CA                              $5CCA
$171     $0F                 67           $840F
         $2B                              $842B
         $87                              $8487
         $9F                              $849F
         $B7                              $84B7
         $CF                              $84CF
         $E7                              $84E7
         $FF                              $84FF
$172     $143                68           $8743
         $158                             $8758

Now get out a blank disk and format it with a name something like BUBBLE.GHOST
or what ever.  At this point I DELETED all unneeded files like the FINDER.DATA
files, P8 in the system subdirectory, and FINDER.ICONS in the icons
subdirectory.

  Copy the PRODOS file and the SYSTEM and ICONS subdirectories to the new disk.
  Copy BUBBLE.SYS16 to the new disk.
  CREATE a new subdirectory called GHOST on the new disk.
  Copy the WAVE and GHOST.SCR files into the new GHOST subdirectory.
  Copy the DESSINS and SONS subdirectories into the new GHOST subdirectory.

A tree directory (other than PRODOS, SYSTEM and ICONS) would look something like this:

File                         Type
---------------------------------
BUBBLE.SYS16                 S16
/GHOST                       DIR
 WAVE                        BIN
 GHOST.SCR                   TXT
 /DESSINS                    DIR
  GHOSTGS.CGS                S16
  GS1.CGS                    S16
  GS2.CGS                    S16
  GS3.CGS                    S16
  GS4.CGS                    S16
  GS5.CGS                    S16
  GS6.CGS                    S16
 /SONS                       DIR
  LESSONS                    BIN

  Now to upload Bubble Ghost to your hard drive use COPY ][+, the finder, or
other file by file copier and copy BUBBLE.SYS16 and GHOST.  The copy program
will copy all this files and subdirectories in GHOST.  Then copy the GENE.ICONS
to your volume/ICONS subdirectory.  To play the game simply luanch BUBBLE.SYS16
