 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 WHAT THIS IS:

 - The 96LIST is a collection of numbers reported as belonging to US and
   Canadian BBSes with one or more lines supporting CONNECT speeds of 9600bps
   or higher.
 - 96LIST is compiled and maintained by Ken Sukimoto, SysOp of the DownTown
   BBS as a service to DownTown BBS subscribers and other callers and is
   published on an irregular basis.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 WHAT THIS ISN'T:

 - This is not intended to be an advertising list. With the way BBS's change,
   there is no way I or most anyone else could keep up with software/hardware
   changes, doorways added/deleted, specialties of the BBS and other features
   that make a BBS unique. This would also make 96LIST even larger than it
   currently is and just one more opportunity to be inaccurate.
 - Although it is the goal, 96LIST is not comprehensive. I am quite sure there
   are a lot of BBS's that have been omitted - rather than attempt to guess at
   BBS names/numbers/cities and modem types, I am depending on reliable
   sources to submit these missing BBS's and accurate information about them.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 COPYRIGHT AND DISTRIBUTION:

 - Since the content of 96LIST is for the most part public knowledge, no
   formal copyright for content is applied for.
 - I'm not even sure that the name "96LIST" isn't already copyrighted; if it
   isn't, then that is the only copyright claimed.
 - Rather than legalese and restrictions, I request common courtesy in the
   distribution of 96LIST.
 - No fee should be charged for 96LIST other than normal system access
   requirements.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

 - 96LIST is dedicated to the SysOps who install high speed modems, enabling
   users to access systems at higher and higher speeds. It is also dedicated
   to these same users who motivated the SysOps to install these modems
   through their contributions; material, inspirational and otherwise.
 - Thanks go to the SysOps, Users and Administrators of U'NI Net, SmartNet,
   and Intelec for their help and the use of their networks to gather
   information for this list.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 NAMING CONVENTION & MISCELLANEA:

 - When distributing this list, please use the following naming convention:
   Do not rename the textfile itself - it should remain named 96LISTmy.TXT.
 - Most BBSes don't like unarchived text files, so if archived, name the
   archive "96LISTmy.ext" where:
   m   = a letter from A to L, A representing January; B is February, etc.
   y   = the last number of the year; 1991 = 1, 1992 = 2, and so on.
   ext = whatever extension the archiving program defaults to.
   The July, 1991 release would be named 96LISTG1.ZIP (using PKZIP to archive)
   as an example of the naming convention.
 - Please note - many systems listed are multi-line or multi-node and their
   inclusion on this list does not mean the number listed has that particular
   setup available. Some BBSes are subscription and reserve the high speed
   lines for subscribers only (The DownTown BBS is such an example).
 - The DownTown BBS is currently a 4 line MajorBBS system with a public access
   line at (213) 484-0260 [sorry, 3/12/2400bps only on this line]. The most
   recent update is available for downloading on the first call. If you wish
   to call just for the 96LIST, log on under the user-ID "VISITOR" to download
   it - no need to register.

  ~~~~~~~~                    AREA CODE CHANGES
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  With the growing number of telephones, some areas are being split into 
  two or more new, different area codes. If your BBS or one that you know
  of is being changed to a different area code, your help in updating the
  96LIST would be greatly appreciated.

                INDIVIDUAL AREA CODE LISTS - REGIONAL LISTS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I've been asked by several people whether I would create Regional versions
  of 96LIST or include countries other than the US and Canada. This is a bit
  more than I'm prepared to do, but if anyone else wants to undertake the 
  project, I'll assist where possible. I've also been asked whether I would 
  include 2400 bps boards. There are already several other national BBS lists
  that do this a whole lot better - and it must be a monsterous task.

                         2400bps NUMBERS on 96LIST
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Someone remarked that they found some 2400 bps numbers listed on 96LIST. 
  The ones that are actually listed as 2400 are usually because they are the
  only PUBLIC numbers available to first time callers, with the 9600+ lines
  reserved for validated or subscribing users. The 9600+ lines are listed so
  users can verify the lines are there. Other sysops have only their public 
  access node listed with multiple modem types. These are sometimes 2400bps
  and the modem types listed are supported on the other nodes on unlisted 
  numbers. I can only list information as it is reported to me - if there
  are those of you who want to verify these numbers, your help would be 
  greatly appreciated. I've had more than a few Sysops submit their BBS number
  in order to get free advertising without having 9600+ capabilities. If you
  know of anyone doing this and disapprove as I do, let me know and I'll 
  create a new file called BOGUS96.LST so they can live in infamy.

                              19,200 and 38,400
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Those of you who have seen me on nets know my stance on 19.2k and 38.4k
  claims. If I see an ad or receive a listing for these figures, they will
  be listed as Modulation Type (HST, Hayes, etc) and 9600. There is no modem
  that will CONNECT at 19.2k or 38.4k - these claims are usually arrived at
  through DTE/DCE rates or through data compression. I won't use 96LIST to
  promote this myth by listing 19.2k or 38.4k claims.

  10/01/91
  ~~~~~~~~
  I want to re-emphasize that I will NOT publish the comm port settings of
  BBS's. It's almost an accepted practice that the comm port will be 
  initialized and locked at either 19.2k or 38.4k. 96LIST would require
  constant revision to keep up with the way sysops change the DTE/DCE rates
  depending on minor hardware changes. I've been flamed on some networks by
  some Sysops who insist the DTE/DCE rate is more important than the actual 
  CONNECT rate. Typically, these Sysops run boards which are 9600 with MNP5
  or use an uncommon proprietary modulation technique and they might feel at
  a disadvantage due to the 14.4k BBS's with v.42bis. I will not knowingly
  list these BBS's as other than their true speed and connect method. I would
  appreciate your support if you agree with my policy.
 
  If you disagree with my policy, I strongly encourage whoever feels strongly
  enough about this to start their own BBS list that uses this method and I
  would like my system listed as 2 lines at 19.2k (actually 2400, but I will
  initialize the port at 19.2k) and the other two 9600+ lines as 38.4k.
