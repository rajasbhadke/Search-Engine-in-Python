                            by CBS

Many of CBS's educational software products are not copy-protected but instead include a plastic overlay which fits over the keyboard and without which the use of the program is difficult.  Each key on the overlay has a color and a name.  For those who don't have the overlay, the following is a transcription of what appears on it thus making the software once again usable although not perhaps as convenient as having the overlay itself.
