Linumber Parameters : "linenum" has the following options :

(blank)                 All lines
num1                    That line only.
num1,num2               All lines from num1 through num2.
num1,                   All lines from num1 through the end.
,num1                   All lines from beginning through num1.

        The numbers num1 and num2 may be line numbers, or a period; period 
signifies the line number of the last line entered or deleted.

        String Parameters: "string" as a parameter in a command means 
"dstringd", where "d" is any printing character except comma (,); period (.);
or a digit (0-9). The string may also contain a "wildcard" character (CTRL-W).

                            EDIT MODE COMMANDS

        When the edit command is being used, the following sub-commands are
available to modify the line being edited.

CONTROL -A              Begin insertion mode; characters will be inserted
                        until another CONTROL character is typed.
CONTROL -B              move cursor back to beginning of the label field.
CONTROL -D              Delete character under cursor.
CONTROL -Fx             Move cursor to next occurence of "x" in line (if any).
CONTROL -H              (left arrow) move cursor left.
CONTROL -I              Destructive tab.
CONTROL -L              Store current edited line and start editing the next.
CONTROL -M              (RETURN) store the edited line.
CONTROL -N              Move cursor to the end of the line.
CONTROL -O              Begin insertion mode, but allow mext character typed
                        to be inserted even if it is a CONTROL -CHARACTER.
CONTROL -Q              Finish edit mode, chopping off all characters from
                        cursor to end of the line.
CONTROL -R              Restore the original line and stay in edit mode.
CONTROL -T              Non destructive tab.
CONTROL -U              (right arrow) move cursor right.
CONTROL -X              Abort the EDIT command.
CONTROL -@              Erase from cursor to the end of the line without
                        leaving edit-mode.
