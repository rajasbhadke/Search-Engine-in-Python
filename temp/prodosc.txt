             Program Writer
           Quick Command Menu
=======================================

  This is a list of command that are in
the EDITOR that you can use. I type
this list directly out of the program,
you might ask why? Well, so you could
have a print out of the command without
having to remember all of them.... this
is a rad editor, so if you program I'm
sure you'll like it.
