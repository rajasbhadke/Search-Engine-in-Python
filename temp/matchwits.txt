
MATCH WITS (Parlor Game for 1 or 2 players)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe
Requirements: One disk drive, KB input


     Patterned after TV's long-running "Concentration", "Match Wits" challenges knowledge, memory, and intuition on a broad front. Even better, the supply of rebus-based matching contests is close to inexhaustible.

     As in the gameshow, play begins with a blank (5x6) grid and you try to locate hidden pairs specifying x,y coordinates of selected squares. So, on a sports grid, "1,1" ("Dallas") and "3,4" ("Cowboys") would be a match. The puzzle pieces at 1,1 and 3,4 are revealed and the player has a chance to enter the solution. Points are awarded for each match; but the lion's share goes to the first player or team to solve the puzzle. After three puzzles, the side with the most points wins.

     Except for the unfortunate omission of x,y labeling (necessitating a good deal of square counting and a few complaints), "Match Wits" has been well-received in small group play testing. Six on-disk categories, with provisions for adding ten more of your own, add up to long lasting parlor game fun.
