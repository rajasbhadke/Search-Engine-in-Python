AMBI IS	[bi Sasha K]
 
ambi is a tribe of
ontological anarchists,
poetic terrorists,
dionysian thyri,
wild yogists,
chasing their own arrows.
 
we are maroons of the desert:
ambi never stops moving.
 
ambi is not cool:
ambi does what it wants.
ambi is a joke:
ambi is the way we live.
 
"Everything is like this, and everything will change."
- Dropo Gunlie
 
"... the TAZ is an intensification, a surplus, an excess, a potlatch,
life spending itself in living rather than merely surviving."
- Hakim Bey
 
ambi has gone to Croatan:
ambi takes place.
ambi is a metaphor:
ambi is a myth.
 
ambi is a conduit.
ambi is the erasure of lines,
the forgetting of names,
the ignoring of boundaries.
 
ambi is a process:
ambi will never be the same.
