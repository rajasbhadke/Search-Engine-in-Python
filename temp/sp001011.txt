The Criminal Justice Act

   The Internet invasion of the UK continues, and we have some e-mail
   addresses where you can register your protest reason: The Criminal
   Justice & Public Order Act of Britain effectively BANS the holding of
   Rave parties in the UK and has revoked British Citizens' right to
   assemble. Method: Use the Internet to register your protest and to
   cast a global vote against this suspension of basic human rights!
    1. The web site www.open.gov.uk run by the UK governments computer
       department has a feedback page. You can address a protest message
       there.
    2. Although the ruling Conservative Party has not given out a public
       adress, we do have the address of one MP, David Shaw e-mail:
    David@dlshaw.demon.co.uk
    3. The UK opposition parties have done very little to stop the
       Criminal Justice Act. Protest to their leaders. The Labour Party
       leader's address is:
    tony.blair@geo2.poptel.org.uk
   The leader of the Liberal Party can be contacted at:
    paddyashdown@cix.compulink.co.uk
    4. Another way to help is send your protest message to British
       companies.
    5. Snail Mail: If you want to contact the British P.M and don't have
       e-mail access then write a letter to Mr J Major, 10 Downing St,
       London, SW1 2AA, United Kingdom
       
   This Bill which was recently passed by the British gov't and is an
   insidious way to stop more than 10 people gathering on public land,
   and threatens the development of democracy and human rights. In
   Australia, we too have problems with finding decent venues and having
   all night dance parties. However, no law yet prohibits the gathering
   of people in order to congregate nor does the law impose a ban on
   repetitive beats., i.e techno music. Spyfood knows that most ravers
   wanna have fun, and its important to think about the plight of others
   who are fighting for their right to rave. If you need to find out more
   info on the Criminal Justice Act and its intentions. Check out the
