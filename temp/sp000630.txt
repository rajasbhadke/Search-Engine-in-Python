MEANDER QUARTERLY
Newsletter of Evolutionary Anarchists
@Liberty, Equality, Cooperation, Respect for Nature@

Meander has been around for about five years.  It is a discussion zine for 
anarchists similar to the old SRAF Bulletin.  Editorial responsibilities 
rotate annually among the readers.  Former editors include Mike Gunderloy, 
Erik Riese, and Carl Bettis who publishes *Crooked Roads* and help with 
*The Frontier Report* (out of Kansas City). 

Please send all newsletter correspondence, material for publication,
donations, and address changes to:
        Ed Stamm, PO Box 1402, Lawrence KS 66044 USA.  Note:  If you have a
long essay or letter, if possible send it to me on a 5 1/4" floppy disk
saved as ASCII text.  I will return your disk.
