                  PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
                    INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD

The working class and the employing class have nothing in common.
There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found  among
millions  of  the  working  people  and  the few, who make up the
employing class, have all the good things of life.
Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers
of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of
production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the
Earth.
We find that the centering of the management of  industries  into
fewer  and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with
the ever-growing power of the employing class.  The trade  unions
foster  a  state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be
pitted against another set  of  workers  in  the  same  industry,
thereby  helping  defeat one another in wage wars.  Moreover, the
trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers  into
the  belief  that the working class have interests in common with
their employers.
These conditions can be changed and the interest of  the  working
class  upheld  only  by an organization formed in such a way that
all its members in any one industry,  or  in  all  industries  if
necessary,  cease  work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any
department thereof, thus making an injury to  one  an  injury  to
all.  Instead of the conservative motto, "A fair day's wage for a
fair   day's   work,"   we   mush  inscribe  on  our  banner  the
revolutionary watchword, "Abolition of the wage system."
It is the historic mission of the working class to do  away  with
capitalism.   The  army  of production must be organized, not for
everyday  struggle  with  capitalists,  but  also  to  carry   on
production  when  capitalism  shall  have  been  overthrown.   By
organizing  industrially  we are forming the structure of the new
society within the shell of the old.
