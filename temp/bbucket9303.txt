computer systems. If you notice any errors or if you know of a new BBS,
please leave a message for Lisa Gronke on DawgGone Disgusted. Even better,

Part-time BBS (those without a dedicated phone line) have been moved to a
separate list.

All BBS on this list are local calls from central Portland and can be
reached using PC Pursuit (ORPOR outdial) . This BBS list is available on
many Portland BBS ... here are a few selected locations where I know prior

This listing is dedicated to Rick Bensene, former sysop of Bit Bucket
BBS, who shaped my ideas of what a BBS should be, and who created this
list, established its standard of quality, and maintained it from
1982 to 1986 ... and to Randy Bush, who introduced me to FidoNet and
offered the facilities of his BBS when I took my BBS offline.
