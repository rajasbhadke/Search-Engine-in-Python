Just before I sold my copy recently, I found that my original wouldn't
boot either when my Zip was enabled.  My deprotected disk worked fine,
though.

Here's my personal crack.  It's very simple.  With a block editor, make
the following changes to the FASTBREAK.SYS16 file (on a copy, of
course):

byte $3E0 (block 2, byte $1E0): change $22 to $AF
byte $3E7 (block 2, byte $1E7): change $F0 to $80

Note that those offsets are relative to the start of the FASTBREAK.SYS16
file.  If your block editor does not support editing files, the actual
block number was $000A on my disk, but this may change from disk to
disk.

Let me know if that helps.
