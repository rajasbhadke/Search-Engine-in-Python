        HOW TO SOLVE DEADLINE
        ---------------------


 ALL COMMANDS ARE IN "QUOTES" AND ALL  DIRECTIONAL MOVES ARE IN [BRACKETS].

  FROM THE FRONT PATH OF THE ROBNER'S ESTATE PROCEED [N]. NOW YOU SHOULD BE
AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE. TYPE 'OPEN DOOR' AND THEN PROCEED [N] AGAIN.
THIS WILL PLACE YOU WITHIN THE ESTATE.  THEN GO [N,N,E,] THEN 'CLIMB STAIRS'
THIS WILL PLACE YOU AT THE SECOND LEVEL OF THE ESTATE. THEN GO [W,W,W,W,N].
THIS WILL PLACE YOU IN THE LIBRARY TO DO YOUR DETECTIVE WORK. FIRST "LOOK RUG".
YOU WILL SEE MUD SPOTS (CRUCIAL FOR THE ARREST). THEN 'TAKE CUP AND PAD AND
CALENDAR AND PENCIL'.  NOW 'RUB PENCIL ON PAPER'. AFTER  HAVING DONE THIS, 'TURN
PAGE ON CALENDAR' AND 'READ CALENDAR'. AFTER HAVING DONE THIS, 'OPEN BALCONY
DOOR' AND GO [E]. THIS WILL PLACE YOU ON THE BALCONY. 'LOOK RAILING' (THIS WILL
CONFIRM OUR MUD THEORY). HAVING DONE ALL OF THE ABOVE-PROCEDE,
[S,E,E,E,E,D,D,W,S,S]. THIS WILL PLACE YOU AT THE FRONT DOOR AGAIN. NOW GO
[NW,S,S,E,S,E,SE]. THIS WILL BRING YOU TO THE SHED (MORE DETECTIVE WORK). NOW,
'LOOK LADDER' (MORE MUD AGAIN-I THINK IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THAT THE MURDERER
USED THE LADDER TO ENTER THROUGH THE BALCONY AND THEN SOMEHOW(?) MURDERED OUR
DEAR FRIEND MR.ROBNER). NOW THIS HAVING BEEN DONE, RETURN TO THE FRONT DOOR.
[NW,W,N,W,N,N,SE]. NOW WE HAVE TO TREK ALL THE WAY UPSTAIRS AGAIN!. GO
[N,N,E,U,U,N,N] YOU SHOULD NOW BE IN DUNBAR'S BATHROOM. TYPE 'LOOK LOBO'
(INTERESTING, HEH?). NOW GO ALL THE WAY DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN. [S,S,S,D,D,W,S,S] YOU
WILL BE AT THE FRONT DOOR AGAIN. NOW YOU HAVE TIME TO TAKE A REST.  TYPE 'WAIT
TILL 11:30'. IT SHOULD NOW BE 11:31.  NOW WE HAVE TO HUNT DOWN MR.MCNABB. GO TO
THE ORCHARD [E,NE,N]. (NOTE:  DUE TO THE NATURE OF DEADLINE, MCNABB MIGHT NOT BE
THERE.  IF HE IS NOT, HUNT HIM DOWN! - IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU FIND HIM).
ONCE MCNABB HAS BEEN LOCATED SAY 'HEY MCNABB'/CR/ 'WHAT IS WRONG'.  AFTER THIS
FOLLOW HIM.  HE WILL THEN POINT OUT TO YOU TWO HOLES IN HIS ROSE GARDEN. YOU
THEN SAY 'LOOK HOLES' (MORE MUD THEORY) AND THEN 'DIG GROUND'.  THEN WITH YOUR
NEW FOUND TREASURE TYPE 'ANALYZE FRAGMENT FOR LOBLO'. NOW WE HAVE TO CATCH THE
WILL READING.  GO [N,N,SE,S,SW,W,S]. YOU WILL BE AT THE FRONT DOOR ONCE AGAIN.
NOW GO [N,N,W] AND WAIT FOR THE WILL TO BE READ. AFTER THAT SAY 'HEY GEORGE'.
THEN TYPE 'SHOW GEORGE THE CALENDAR'. HE WILL PANIC AND RUN UPSTAIRS.  FOLLOW
HIM!!  HE THEN WILL DUCK INTO HIS ROOM AND YOU GO [W,W,N,N].  THIS WILL PLACE
YOU IN THE LIBRARY'S BALCONY. NOW TYPE 'WAIT 10 MIN'.  ONCE GEORGE ENTERS THE
ROOM WAIT FOR ABOUT 2 MIN AND THEN [S], 'LOOK BOOKCASE', 'PRESS BUTTON', 'GET
WILL', 'LOOK SAFE', 'GET PAPERS', 'READ PAPERS' THEN GO TO THE LIVING ROOM
[S,S,E,E,E,E,D,D,E,E] AND SAY 'HEY BAXTER', 'WHAT ABOUT FOCUS', 'SHOW FOCUS TO
BAXTER', 'HEY DUNBAR', 'SHOW FOCUS PAPERS', 'WHAT ABOUT FOCUS'. THEN FOLLOW
DUNBAR CLOSELY.  ONCE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE SHE WILL DROP A PIECE OF PAPER.  'GET
PAPER', 'READ PAPER' THEN CONTINUE FOLLOWING HER. ONCE YOU CATCH UP, ASK HER
'HEY DUNBAR', 'SHOW PAPER TO DUNBAR'. THEN MAKE TRACKS FOR THE SHED.  [E,E,SE].
WAIT FOR BAXTER.  ONCE DUNBAR AND BAXTER ARE PRESENT TYPE 'ARREST BAXTER AND
DUNBAR'

NOTE:THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN ARRIVE AT THAT VERDICT. THERE
     ARE ALSO MORE PUZZLES TO BE SOLVED BUT THAT IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY
     TO A SUCCESSFUL ARREST. EXAMPLE:  THE MAIL DELIVERED AT 11:10, THE
     MORNING PAPER AT 11:30, THE PHONE ,ETC.
