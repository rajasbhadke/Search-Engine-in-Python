Well, I had an interesting little talk with Ralph (Necromancer) last night.  I
called him up,and we were talking about junk (Apple, RModem, etc) when I asked
that if he knew that Deadthstar had crashed.  He told me that Deathstar wasnt
crashed, but down INDEFINITELY.

He told me that Bob (Mindbender) sold ALL his Apple ][ computers, and bought a
Mac.  He also told me that he is going to do the same within the next week.

What does this mean?  Well, one of the best boards in the country (if not the
best) will be down for good.  We will also be losing one of the best pirates of
all time also, Necromancer.

For all that dont know it, please ASCII this post around..  So people find out
that Deathstar is no longer up!  Thanks (BTW:  Ralph told me to do so)
