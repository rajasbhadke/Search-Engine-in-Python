
CROSSCOUNTRY USA (Educational Simulation for 1 or 2 players)
Compatible: 64K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, KB input


    "Crosscountry USA" represents a new wave of good-enough-to-play educational simulations. In the role of a long haul trucker, your objective is to make assigned pickups and deliveries in the best posible time while minimizing expenses.

     Food, lodging, fuel, and rig depreciation are your principal costs; so the shorter the routing and quicker the the trip, the lower your expenses. However, too much speed, (besides risking tickets) can lead to costly accidents, as can long periods without food or rest.

     The game both looks and plays like many adventures, accepting text commands such as "start truck", "drive sw", and "turn wipers on". Numerous attractive hires frames, some with animation, show scenery as viewed through the cab's windshield, delivery stops, diners, etc.; and the dashboard is complete down to a lights-on indicator and CB radio (to call for help). National and local map screens facilitate routing, which is point-to-point instead of following the actual interstate highway layout.

     Besides a commodities list and copiable routing maps for the 180 cities represented, the package includes educational recommendations and an editor for game customizing. If you've ever felt the lure of life on the open road as a highballing trucker, then "Crosscountry USA" is bound to score a big 10-4.
