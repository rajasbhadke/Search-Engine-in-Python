[ Welcome to the National Enlightener ]
[ We are proud to present: Issue ]I[! ]

       "Rags of The Elites!!1!!@"

This issue will be divided into 3 parts
due to space limitations. This issue 
will be our biggest yet because of our
reprinting of the ELITE!@# rags! which
take up a lot of space. The first 
2 sections will be rags of the elites. 
100% un-retouched rags from the mega
elitez!@#!@. Our comments will be 
placed between "[]"'s. [Like this]. 


Enough of this, on with the rags!1!!!!!
---------------------------------------

[This first one is the opening message
on the board that first started all the
filter shit. The 414 Wizard gets our 
vote for being the biggest overuser of
the word "ELITE" in the history of 
the computer. He even named a group
after it. Believe it or not, this guy
was 20 years old when he wrote this.

Donate to the "Buy James a dictionary
fund!" it's not too late!]

Well once again the login's have reach country wide. I get 2-3 new lod lozers a
day....Anyways...The SYSTEM passwords are going to be changed very soon. And
I will be putting up a system for just new users (and some old ones that didn't
leave me their phone # do tell them the new login) at The (infamous) Phoenix's
house. This system will ask you for you handle and phone # (must be real!) and
then you will have to leave a resume and then answer a series of Phreak/Hacking
questions (writen by *ELITE* members). If you seem to know what you're talking
about I will assign you a password on this Cryton *ELITE* system and call you
voice to give you the new login system passwords.

This provides security on my part and also asures high quality of users on this
system. You will be validated for the level seen fit by your RESUME and it
will be raised once you contribute to the system.

Well see yea in the near future (op maybe not!)

[Update!]

Like the god damn disk fucken blew up yesterday...I lost quite a few of the
new messages left in the last 2 weeks...Sorry, ***PLEASE*** repost them as soon
as posable! Thanx for the suport.

 Also...You can now reach Cryton through 304-263-0811 ext. #3373! It forwards
to the board. So does the old 800 and the 301 and 818 #'s, so we now have a
total of 5 #'s! one of them toll free!

 New users please read the System Rules and follow them. I don't want to see
any more Credit Card numbers on the system. Be real anyone that wants them
bad enough can get them at just about any garbage.

 Well spread the word of the Philter...It won't be up forever...

Later,

[Just a note here. The spelling and all
that, is the lod guy's who uploaded it.
The message is ragging on people in
James "*ELITE*" club not caring about 
it. Up there he is talking about Lord
Digital and Mr. Xerox, but later it 
would include Paul Muad'Dib as well.
Contrary to all lod claims, Paul WAS
on the board. And we will show you
the message later in this section.
HPL was talking about Phantom Access,
which Lord Digital did, Mr. Xerox 
liked and The Wizard blabbed about
all over his general section.]

---------------------------------------

[The following is James' conversation
with the loddie who uploaded the 
previous msg.]

OK?

Date -+>SAT APR 13  3:45:47 AM

     I appreciate the feedback about the "Privacy Invasion" piece!
I still feel their was no justification for the extended period of line
observation but I will not risk my phreedom on what I feel is right!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
     Concerning the above AE CHAT......
  1]  I am sure everyone has read the General Bullshit Board messages
      from the begining.  The Strife (pre-AE chat) is what caused the
      Cryton system to go Private in the first place.
-=-=
  2]  The AE CHAT is nothing new... the best thing to due is ignore the
      remarks  (although I must admit it makes for interesting reading).
-=-=
  3]  7-15% of all callers to the Philter are ragettes who like to
      dirupt what ever they can.

  4]  My advice is to just ignore them but sometime you get a really obnoxious
      idiot who doesn't even rank a 3 on the API -Average Prick Intelligence
      score.  I act like a wuss! It amuses me and the worst enemy you can h
      have is one inwhich you do not know how strong he/she is!!
-=-=
  5]  The "informer" remark could possibly be real....But in my opinion if the
      "informer" was good enough to be hear then great....just as long he/she
      is ACTIVE!!!  [ I purposely spelled ^ hear wrong- a trashy pun put
      what the Batman?
-=-=
  6]  A final note... About "hacking a trip" to meet these people .... I feel
      is a waste of time... why lower yourself..... But to put it in words
      that the API can understand....

      KISS My ASS YOU STUPID MOTHER FUCKIN SON-OF-A-BITCH... I COULD GIVE
      A FLYING FUCK WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT "GROUP" YOU PRETEND YOUR IN!!
      WHY DON'T YOU RAISE YOU COCK SUCKING MENTALITY AND QUITE PRETENDING
      YOU ARE GOING CHANGE MY PHONE INTO A PAY-FONE (HOW FUCKING ORIGINAL)
      BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW HOW IDLE YOUR CHILDISH THREATS ARE!  SO WHY
      DON'T YOU JERK OFF YOUR MUTT AND LET HIM SPERM IN YOUR ASS!!!!
      COCK SUCKIN MUTHER FUCKIN ASS LICKING PRICK!!!
-=-=
      Boy!... I must be really intelligant and impressing all of you with
      my choice of slang... gee...gosh....gee whiz!!!!
      So lets like surgically remove this cancerous tumor!!! me guad!

[This was followed by 50 other msg's 
just like this. But you get the 
picture.]

---------------------------------------

[Here is the Wizard's own rebuttal to
lod.]


 Well like I have the Reconnecting routine working great now...Believe it or
not it'll enve handle call waiting! No more disconnects because of your call
waitng going off!


 Ok like what you read above was buffered chat with someone who called my
line when I was in AE.

 As for my abilities to program...Shit be real who do you think wrote this and
a few other boards? I also have 2 jobs; one is programing and consalting for
the Apple & IBM pc's and I install networks and write original business soft-
ware. My other job is with a large data compainy. I am a system operator and
programer there too. We have a few honneywell level 6's and an IBM seires 1
with a few Gandalf pax lines, etc...about a 2 1/2 millon dollor computer room.
We use TCL (Terminal Control Language) among other things. So like be real
about your statements.

 And as for the *ELITE*...Well we are all friends before we became members
of the club; Which is alot more then I can say for the LOD members that all
hate eachother and have hate lists a mile long (might as well cause everyone
hates them anyways). For about 90% of the 18 members I can say that they care
(their a bit lazy but they care) what happens to the *ELITE* otherwize why did
they join?

 One thing I'd like to say about you the TELEPHONE TERRORIST as you wish to
be called...I'd like to see a bit of proff that you know what your doing! 80%
of your message is lies and your just out to start some kind of war. I belive
I dealt with you before and looks like It'll have to be done again. Go ahead
and try to do something I'd gladly waist you (Phreak wize or Physical: I have
no quarks with carding a trip to your place and dealing with you in person
or meet us in New York for at the *ELITE* councel meeting. We'd gladly waist
you guys face to face).

Well enuf said, Have phun...

(*)- The *ELITE* Phreaker's Club -(*)

[Quite a mouthfull. How all the members
of *ELITE* knew each other is not known
to us. Considering they lived in about
20 different states, can't see it... 
We'll footnote relevent stuff later,
but for now the one thing worth saying
is that James (The Wizard), ALWAYS 
challenged lod to a fight. He was one
of the people who physically wanted to
beat the shit out of them, and they
always backed down. More on this later
as well. James was a fool, but unlike 
lod, he wasn't a coward. lod seems to
be filled with the classic computer
geeks who live out their fantasies of
being big and tough, through modem.
But we're getting ahead of ourselves.]

---------------------------------------

[Here is James' post on a chat with
some kid about lod members.]


OK SO THATS WHY URE COOL AND DONT GOT A GOD COMPLEX YET I GUESS!, AND HOW 
GOOD WOULD YOU SAY THE DUDES IN LOD ARE? ANY GOOD? OR ARE THEY JUST ALL TALK
AND NOT GOOD?

I'D SAY FOR THE MOST PART THEIR JUST  SPINNING THEIR WHEELS...

SO LEX & BLOTTO ARENT HOT SHIT?

BLOTTO IS HISTORY ...HE GOT IS ASS PUT ON PROBATION AND LAYED OFF FROM HIS JOB.
HE'S A FUCKING NO SKILL, NO JOB, GEEK WHO WEARS MAKEUP AND DYES HIS HAIR. 
I CHALLENGED THE FAG TO FIGHT, BUT HE IS SCARED OF ME. I CAN SEE WHY, THE LARD
ASS RUMOR WAS JUST A JOKE BY ME, HE AND VINNY ARE BOTH ... HOW TO PUT IT.... 
CLASSICAL LOD MEMBERS... BIG MOUTH, LOUD VOICE, NO GUTS, AND 98 LB. 5FT TALL 
GREASY GEEKS. AND THAT IS NO SHIT! BLOTTO WEIGHS LIKE 140 LBS. I COULD BEAT
THE SHIT OUT OF HIM WITH 1 HAND. VINNIE IS EVEN WORSE.

THAT'S FUNNY AS HELL. NO WONDER THEY GET SUCH HARDON'S THREATENING PEOPLE ALL
OVER THE PLACE.

NO SHIT. I WOULD BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF EVERY ONE OF THOSE LOUDMOUTH GEEKS IF
THEY WOULD EVER SHOW UP. BLOTTO SAID HE WAS COMMING UP HERE, BUT LIKE EVERYTHIG
ELSE IS WITH HIM... IT WAS ALL JUST TALK...

[I'm tempted to jump right into that,
but will wait until on lod itself. But
EVERYTHING James (in his own, illiterate
way) said, is true from our obser-
vations.]

---------------------------------------

[Here is Lord Digital ragging on James]

    Wizard: not saying I give a flying fuck what LOD does with itself. I
    wouldn't however be laughing so hard until I was certain that my own bbs
    was crash proof... While taking a little tour through your board the other
    day I stumbled upon, of all things... a personal phone list, that you were
    thoughtfull enough to keep on disk with the bbs, goodness... Why it even
    includes the current code you're using, and I wonder who Ron (FBI) is...?

    Also, why post Blotto's address & # on the elite board? You're making it
    look like field day at kindergarden. Are we excepted to care what his 
    real name or address or whatever are...? `We' can presumably all get each
    others real names, etc. But who the fuck cares...? this is getting 
    incredibly stupid, if you don't like someone, call them up and tell them.
    Or whatever turns you on. Posting about it does nothing but get the 500
    Broadway Hacker clones of the world calling them 24 hrs a day.

    Finally, why do you have an AT&T security person, you admit to not even
    knowing, on you're elite board...? I'm not going to tell you it's stupid
    since you're doubtlessly aware of this already, which makes me wonder why
    you're doing it.....

Lord Digital


[Here we see Lord Digital breaking one
of the ELITE commandments by not jumping
on Blotto and ragging on him for no 
reason. The first part "Don't give a 
fuck what LOD does with itself", was in
reference to James claim of crashing
Blottoland, LOD, and WOPR. Which was a
LIE! James did put up every one of 
those boards, their files, msgs, user
lists, and software, onto his ae line.
But it was Mr. Xerox who did the crash-
ing. In almost anything James "did" or
"programmed" you can substitute Mr.
Xerox & Lord Digital, respectively. 
The other part refers to LD crashing
James' own board & reading his 
personal phone list & calling him a
fool for leaving it on disk. The last
part refers to a AT&T agent on James
board. This guy was Cable Pair, and as
you all now, the eventual reason why
Cryton went down.]

---------------------------------------

[Here is Mr. Xerox's msg. in response
to LD's post about James being a fool.]

Firstly, It's good to see you again! It's been too long!!! Glad to see you on
this corner of the world!

I've always liked the fact that you speak your mind and don't fuck around with
the usual horseshit. Please don't take this msg. as criticism, I am being 
sincere right now. When you logged in, the collective IQ of the board took a
leap upwards. But I think you should understand the current situation before
attacking the way Wizzy runs the board.

For a long time the bbs was open to the public, just recently have I convinced
James to close it to the public. So bear with us, we're weeding out the know
nothings. As for the phone list, granted it shoudn't have been there, and I
have to have a talk with Wizzy about that, since my own numbers are in there,
and if it hadn't been you crashing it, there could have been depressing
reprecussions.

The first new phreak who starts a war over Lord Digital's msg. is off. No 
questions asked, you are gone. Everything he said is true, if you cannot
accept it, that is your problem, not ours.

     As an aside here, see how indenting the margin can cause a paragraph to
     STAND OUT and be more readable? And see how !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'s
     (Contrary to popular belief) aren't needed? (Listen to me and don't use
     me as an example! I know I'm using entirely too many !'s today!)


    Mr. Xerox,
Here's to Crime...


[This goes on for about 10 msg's before
they finally take it to email. Para-
phrased:

Gee LD I love you,
Gee MX I love you too.

Maybe we can love each other.

And so on. Xerox's threat of deleating
people who started up on Lord Digital,
was in reference to the 50 or so ELITE
club supporters who were Wizzy's yes 
men, and always cried about it when LD,
and then later Xerox himself, ragged on
Wizzy and the club]

[Numb]:72
[Subj]:DON'T LAUGH. HE IS PERFECT LOD MATERIAL. NEVER JUDGE LEST YE BE JUDGED!
[From]:MR. XEROX (Cell #5)
[Date]:TUE APR 16  12:14:29 AM


Greetings from Mr. Xerox,

Frankly, tis my humble opinion he is perfect LOD material and rather than being
laughed at, his great skill should be nutured and encouraged to lessen so he 
may take his rightfull place among the hallowed ranks of LOD!

Seriously folks, he reminds me of Vinny. Speaking of humor, guess who 
should call me today and ask, of all things, how to start a conference? Why
our friend Vinny. Must be going through a time loop, I can remember only a
year ago when he was asking me that very same question and requesting admission
to KOS in the same breath. 

But I have to hand it to them in the PR department. There has never been a 
greater collection of know-nothings, gathered together in a group that is so
universally known. When one spends all his free time calling boards as the
LOD do, these things probably just happen. God knows when I let Vinny join
KOS as an apprentice it was for his tenacious ability to sit at his phone for
hours on end, dialing thousands of numbers nobody else wanted to, and logging
into every board. But enough stabs at Vinny, let  me give you a few more pieces
of my mind (yes I can certainly spare them).

BIOC is another person who would best be defined as master secretary cum typist
(That (cum) is latin for you children, so don't get too excited now). 

But the biggest know nothing of them all is none other then Tuc. Dear little
Tuc. Good old Tuc, god I hate him. One day soon I will repay his little favor
to me.

Other people worth laughing at: Terminal Man, Sharp Razor, X man, Blotto. Now
don't get me wrong, they aren't any worse then average bbs flotasm, but they
are no better. Well Terminal Man (No relation to Terminus, don't start crying
now Len) and Sharpy are a bit worse then average bbs users, but lets not get
into that now.

One point I do give LOD. They have proved that it is not only possible, but
very easy, to set up your own little world. Filled with people who know 
nothing and are nothing. Set up boards for each other, declare yourselves
elite (what a word that is, right James? sorry James, don't you cry either),
and do it all while really doing nothing at all in the field you are supposed
to be good in. Other then typing up manuals (hats off to Vinny, who is the
only one who does this), and having 2 or 3 names carrying an entire group of
fools. Not that those 2 or 3 in the forefront know anything either. The single
person in LOD (is he even in lod? I don't know anymore), who is any good, 
would be Blue Archer. 

Got's me 2 conferences on hold and nobody around, such is life.

Mr. Xerox

Paul Muad'Dib.
NOT of LOD or anything else.
 etc.


[Untouched. Despite any claims lod
might make, Paul is not in their group.
Since this msg. was posted by the 
person himself, We'd be inclined to
believe it. The loddies who think
otherwise should go have a long 
talk with Paul Muad'dib. This msg 
also proves that Paul WAS on Cryton,
again contrary to what loddies said.]

[This seems like a good time to bring
up james' "you're in the *ELITE* now"
syndrome. On the last userlist, Xerox
Digital, and Paul, were all listed as
members. When in fact Paul was never
in the *ELITE* Lord Digital was insta-
assigned membership. And Xerox never
supported the group anyway. We don't
know what delusions James had here,
but he seemed to make anyone he 
considered good, a automatic member
of his club whether or not they wanted
to join.]

MESSAGE #37: TRACING!


Msg left by: X-MAN
Posted: SUN JUL 22  9:26:55 AM

I just wanted to inform you people
who think that Metro, Sprint, etc.
"trace" are off base. These companies
have no right whatsoever to trace
your number because it is against
the law. They are, however, allowed
to keep a record of thee calls made
on somebody's code for the month,
where the call was maade, etc. In
other words, ANI is allowed. They
also are allowed to set up trap
codes on cosmos. Metro random 
traces sometimes too.

Msg left by: BIOC AGENT 003

Toll Libraries really aren't as big a secret as Mr. Sharp Razor makes them
out to be. He is just attributing the customary LOD mysticism to something
mundane and attempting to make you think it's harder than it really is.

Toll Libraries are usually used in conjunction with CNA numbers when a customer
claims to have not made a call that was on his bill.  Basically, the Toll
Library stores all operator toll tickets (in areas without CAMA/AMA) and
other customer calling information.  Toll Libraries also carry such interesting
things as unlisted numbers...
 
If you trash your telco business office a lot, you should come across a 
Toll Library Phone # list.  It is in the "Tolls" section along with the CNA
numbers.
 
Finally, I would like to say (once again) that board numbers should not be
posted anywhere else than board #1!

[Here is a debate on The Tempest's bbs,
which started about punk/new wave vs.
heavy metal, on the music sub. Somehow
some guy dragged in Blotto as a rep-
resentative of hardcore band members,
from there the arguement shifted to
dumping on Blotto & using him as a
perfect example of a complete fuckup.]

Title  :MATURITY?
Date   :OCT 23  10:47:10 AM
 

I think that it's quite immature to go  running around looking like a freak
with frizzed out hair, dumb looking clothes, paint on their face to make them
look even worse, and going around saying their shit music has quality.
There is absolutely no maturity in any  of these common "attributes"..  I think
it's stupid, and is an insult to the higher society.

I also think it's stupid for guys to run around looking like fags, wearing make
up, strange hair styles with strange colors, and guys wearing ear rings.
(I also think fags are immature if they can't even use properly, that which
god gave them!!!)

So you see, the immaturity really isn't in the music, it is in the style of the
performers, and the trends they try to  set.  The most mature people are those
who can listen to music and simply enjoy it, whatever type of music it may be.
The immature people are those who "live" their music; Those who make themselves
look like shitheads just to listen to music.

It's most immature for the music artists to fill our society with this "crap".
But the real immaturity comes in when   you people start to follow and believe
in these freaks.  If you like their music, >>GREAT<<!!  Just listen and enjoy!!
don't pattern your life around this shit.

From   :ZERO PAGE
Title  :I agree
Date   :OCT 23  11:52:25 PM
 

I too agree with Eric's interpretation of music. People who live out the
music they listen to (ie:wear stupid clothes, guys wearing earrings, 
makeup, fucked up hair) are the ones who are truly stupid. That type of
person is the lowest on the musical scale.  That type of person wants to
have an image of being 'A metelar' or 'A waver' those are the trendy
geeks who are the musical lame asses.  People who judge music on its
sound, lyrical content, are the only intelligent music listeners. Personally
I like ALL GOOD MUSIC.  Unfortunatly for Heavy Metal, Hardcore, New Wave,
and Punk. It is plauged by mobs of groups who are untalented and lame.
They try and develop their image with stupid clothes, violence, and
the like.  The immature fall for this ploy, and say they like that
group, when they all they really like is that image.  If they only knew
how stupid they look, and how stupid they sound defending it. Another thing
I wonder about are the kind of parents who let their kids grow up looking
and acting like this. They surely hold such high intensity, difficult jobs
like sock sorters at woolworths. Which reminds me of Blotto. His parents
probably fill this criteria 100%. I have yet to see, in all my years, a
bigger no talent, no skill, pirate/phreak/hacker, and now musical, posuer.
He is the idol of all you new rodents, but you have nothing to work on except
your egos. You are already at his level, and will in all likleyhood stay there
forever. I would have loved to see all these assholes 4 years ago. Instead of
being worshipped, they would have been ground into the dust for being the lame
shitheads they are.

Title  :MUSIC & BLOTTO
Date   :OCT 25  9:38:45 PM
 

Am I in the dark? Am I the only one who doesn't know who we are talking about?
Who is Blotto? Why did he take & desecrate the holy name of Blotto from animal
house? Why do we care? Well just to be a conformist: Blotto is a asshole, I 
hate him, whoever he might be. & May his 2 incher wilt and fall off. Seriously,
anyone who likes hardcore or punk is a asshole of the decade candidate auto
matically. Their performers and audience are full of no education, brain dead
losers.

Now the really important questions. Why was nobody at the cluster on Saturday!?
Why did Ted gain another 40 lbs. (What is that now Ted, 450?). Just kidding Ted
stay calm!

From   :LORD DIGITAL
Title  :IF I MAY INTRUDE INTO ALL THIS...
Date   :OCT 26  8:27:10 PM


Qs... or whoever.... the reason it doesn't work, is simple... You never init
your flags.... How is the modem supposed to know what mode it's in...? Just
do a jsr to initmdm, with something like;

        LDA  #$00
        STA  FLAG1
        STA  FLAG2
        STA  FLAG3
        etc...

You also don't set up any of the ramregs. The cat returns with some of them
wiped out....

As for "smooth tones"...? The tones on almost everything were/are mutilated.
At least as opposed to `true' dtmf. This is because Novation computed a 16
byte sine lookup table & almost all the `clone tables' are taken from catpacks
routines. They used 16 bytes in order to fit everything onto a single page of
memory & meet Robbins original timing requirements. The way the cat dials 
touch tones is by synching them off the clock speed, this is the reason that
accelerators will not work with the cat & the same reason some of the old
Franklin clones didn't work either. AE uses the same lookup table, or I am
assuming it does, I've never dissassembled it completely, but it was written
by Bill Blue & Mark Robbins... Considering that Robbins wrote all the Comware's
up to version 3.something, It seems likely it would use identical routines 
(This is the reason the cat will occasionally fail to `break' the dialtone).
Well what was done in mine is a recalculation of the timing, so now the sine
lookup itself takes a full page (256 bytes), & has the effect of "smooth" 
tones you asked about.

Music.... Like you say, it's only sound. So why create such a big deal out of 
it...? There is one group and one composer (So kill me for being different),
that is more than `just sound' to me. The group being Led Zeppelin, the 
composer being Wagner. This doesn't mean I pattern my life after either one of
them. It just sounds "right" to me. I also like Pink Floyd very much, as well
as U2, King Crimson, Tears for Fears, Lords of the New Church, BOC, etc... This
covers everything from rock, classical, new wave, heavy metal, and whatever
else you might throw in. This doesn't mean I know or care who dresses like
what, or looks like what. They might as well be dead for all I care, (Wagner
is, part of Zeppelin is...) I happen to like the music. So what...?

As for video's... for & against. Bands such as Iron Maiden, etc. Can only be
enhanced by video's, nothing to lose. On the other hand imagine a song like
Kashmir with a video.... pretty much kills the song. A recent example of this
is the icehouse `No Surrender' video. While it's a surprisingly good song, 
the video is of a guy driving in a car.... what the hell is that...? It has
nothing at all to do with the music, it's just annoying. Another perfect 
example of this is Deep Purple's `Perfect Strangers' video.... it's a group
film of them playing soccer.... yeah... (Yawn)

The reason "The apple has more software cracked then anything else" is because
juvenille assholes jumped on the bandwagon. You think I was some kind of 
fucking demigod or hero? it's easy cracking software. But the clueless moron's
who buy Apples don't realize this, so a bunch of geeks can follow hardcore &
pirates harbor cracking tips, insert their ridiculous title pages and put it
out all over the place. Today's pirates do not know how to crack, they know a
series of methods, if all the methods fail, they give up. There are VERY FEW
decent pirates left, I am inclined to say that Black Bag is the only competant
group left. And the only reason losers can do this is because of the morons who
blindly idolize them. They don't know shit. The only difference between you and
them is a stack of cracking files & the adulation of countless idiots.
