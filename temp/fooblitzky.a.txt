Hello all,
   This is The Unbeliever with yet another doc file. This one you ask? Fooblitzky, the latest infocom. I will do my best to give you a verbal description of all pictures.
   This file is the bare essentials for playing, there will be another file titled "Fooblitzky offical rules" with a break down of all things mentioned herein, and one other file titled "Fooblitzky playing sheet".
   So here we go:

How to play Fooblitzky
   The bare essentials

   Fooblitzky is a gane of deduction, strategy, and chance for 2, 3, or 4 players. You'll move around the city of Fooblitzky, buying items with foobles, acquiring valuable information, and chasing or avoiding other players. You'll also risk encountering the Chance Man and crossing dangerous intersections. YOUR GOAL IS TO FIGURE OUT 4 CORRECT ITEMS, OBTAIN THEM AND BE THE FIRST TO BRING THEM TO A CHECK POINT. No two games are alike!

   With the rules in this booklet, you'll be able to start your game of Fooblitzky. Refer to the Offical Rules for more detailed information, including how to use the joystick. The reference card will tell you how to use your keyboard instead of the joystick.

TO BEGIN:

1. INDICATE THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS IN THE GAME by using the joystick to point to the appropriate dog (2, 3, or 4) and then pressing the joystick button.

2. EACH PLAYER SECRETLY CHOOSES AN ITEM. There are 18 items displayed on 3 screens which you can see, one at a time, by pressing the button. While the other players look away, each player chooses one item by pointing to it and pressing the joystick button. If there are fewer than 4 players, each player chooses one item and the computer chooses the rest.
THESE 4 SECRETLY CHOSEN ITEMS BECOME THE 4 CORRECT ITEMS WHICH YOU MUST OBTAIN AND BRING TO A CHECK POINT IN ORDER TO WIN THE GAME.

3. PRICES OF THE 4 CORRECT ITEMS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. Write these down on your worksheet - this is valuable information!

MOVING AROUND:

1. Use the joystick button to "roll" when you see the WHEEL OF FORTUNE.

2. MOVE YOUR TOKEN from square to square by pushing the joystick in the appropriate direction. You must move exactly the number of squares rolled UNLESS you enter an activity square (store, restraunt, locker, etc.) OR land on a sidewalk square occupied by another player, resulting in a bump.

3. END YOUR MOVE by pressing the joystick button. If you're IN AN ACTIVITY SQUARE, you'll usually have choices to make (such as which item to buy in a store). Use the joystick to point to what you want, then press the joystick button to confirm.

DEDUCING THE CORRECT ITEMS:

1. The ITEM YOU CHOSE at the beginning of the game is one of the correct items, so you really only need to figure out 3 others.

2. You were told the COST of the 4 correct items (so if none of them cost 8 foobles, you can cross all 8-fooble items off your worksheet).

3. If an item is OUT-OF-STOCK in a store and you know that NO ONE BOUGHT IT at that store, you can be sure the missing item is one of the correct items chosen at the start of the game. Cricle it on your worksheet.

4. If you find that an item PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED at a store is STILL IN STOCK at that store, you'll know that more than one person chose that item at the start of the game and you therefore need at least 2 of that item to win.

5. Every time you enter a CHECK POINT, you'll be told how many correct items and how many incorrect items you are carrying (but you won't be told which is which).

6. Every now and then, the CHANCE MAN will surprise you on the sidewalk and sell you 1 of 3 random items. Only one of these items will be correct - but he won't tell you which one.

OBTAINING ITEMS:

1. You can BUY items at STORES.

2. If you're lucky, you can BUY an item from the CHANCE MAN.

3. The item you chose at the start of the game is in one of your two LOCKERS. You can take it out at any time.

4. You can BUMP ANOTHER PLAYER by moving your token to an occupied sidewalk square and pressing the joystick button. You'll both drop all your items, which will be displayed on the screen. You'll then take turns picking up the items. (You'll always have the same number of items after a bump as before, so there's little point in bumping someone if you're not carring anything.)

GETTING RID OF ITEMS;

1. You can GIVE AWAY ALL your items at CHARITY CENTRAL.

2. You can SELL items at the PAWN SHOPS.

3. You can STORE 1 item in an EMPTY LOCKER.

USING YOUR WORKSHEET:

USING YOUR WORKSHEET IS NECESSARY in order to deduce the correct items, know where they're available, and avoid costly mistakes. People who use their worksheets correctly have a definite advantage over those who don't.

1. Write down how much the correct items cost when you're shown this information at the start of the game.

2. Circle the correct items and cross out the incorrect items as you figure them out.

3. Whenever anyone enters a store, note which item is bought by marking the appropriate quadrant next to that item.

4. Whenever you see an out-of-stock item that has not been previously purchased, make a note that it's gone and that it is a correct item.

5. Keep track of what each player is carring so you know whom you want to bump.

SOME QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

1. WHO'S THE GUY WITH THE BLACK CAPE?
   He's the Chance Man, who sometimes shows up when your turn ends on a sidewalk square. He's nice half the time: he'll give you a free turn, give you foobles, or sell you an
item at 1/2 price. Half the time he's not so nice: he'll steal from you or send you to the hospital.

2. WHICH LOCKER IS MY ITEM IN?
   You'll have to figure that out yourself.

3. WHY DON'T I JUST BUT EVERYTHING?
   First of all, you can't carry more than 4 items at a time. Secondly, items cost foobles, and you have only a limited number of foobles to spend.

4. WHERE CAN I GET MORE FOOBLES?
   You can sell items to the pawn shops. Or you can go to a restaurant, where you'll wash dishes to earn 4 foobles per turn. You can stay in a restaurant as many turns as you like.

5. CAN I BUY ANYTHING AT THE PAWN SHOPS?
   Anything sold to the pawn shops, stolen by the Chance Man, or donated to Charity Central can be purchased at the pawn shops.

6. HOW DO I USE THE PHONE BOOTHS?
   You can use the phone booths to call any store in any quadrant. You'll be shown which items the store has in stoch and which items are out-of-stock. Phone calls are free.

7. IS IT SAFE TO CROSS THE STREETS?
   When the crosswalk is clear, it's perfectly safe to cross the street. If there's an X in the crosswalk, you can try crossing, but you may get hit by a car and sent to the hospital.

8. I'M IN THE HOSPITAL! HOW CAN I GET OUT?
   If you roll a multiple of 3, you're automatically discharged. If you don't roll a multiple of 3, you can pay 10 foobles and get out immediately, or you can remain in the hospital another turn. Each turn in the hospital costs 3 foobles. After 3 turns, you will be automatically discharged.

9. HOW CAN I MOVE QUICKLY BETWEEN QUADRANTS?
   For 6 foobles, you can get on the UGH (the Underground Gliding Highway), which will take you from one quadrant to the next. You can remain on the UGH as long as you want at no extra charge.

10 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MORE THAN ONE PLAYER CHOOSES THE SAME ITEM?
   If 2 players choose the same item, everyone has to get 2 of that item (if 3 players choose the same item, everyone has to get 3 of that item, etc.) The number of items available will increase accordingly.


That's about it for this part.
See ya....
