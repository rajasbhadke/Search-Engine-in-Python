SOLIDARITY WITH SPANISH
ANTI-MILITARISTS

For over five years the INSUMISION campaign has been fighting to end compulsory
military service in Spain. At least ten thousand people have refused to serve in
the army or do the social service ( the supposed alternative if you refuse to go in
the army a bit like a nightmare version of community service ) which is used by the
state to replace public service jobs. Hundreds of them have been taken to court and
sentenced to between one year and twenty-eight months in jail. These young people
are called INSUMISOS. At this moment there are 200 prisoners for this cause and 75
people are in hiding. The government and especially the justice minister face a
situation they don't know how to deal with. Now is the time for an international
campaign in support of the Insumisos and against the Spanish state which is forcing
its youth into the army. Anti-militarists in Spain are asking for solidarity
actions at spanish embassies and consulates such as demos graffiti or petitions
demanding an amnesty for the insumisos in prison or on the run an end to trials of
anti-militarists and the permanent ending of compulsory military and social
service. Anyone fancy organising a demo here ?
