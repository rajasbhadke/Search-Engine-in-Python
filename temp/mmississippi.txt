        Murder on the Mississippi is a unique form of entertainment that will thrill action players and adventure gamers alike.  To join Sir Charles Foxworth in the annals of crime detection, you'll use a joystick or the keyboard and all the powers of deduction that you can muster.  
        To get the adventure rolling, you must first stumble upon a real live or rather dead corpse.  From that point on, everyone on the boat will have something to say about the victim and why he or she couldn't possibly have been involved in the crime.
        You'll have to listen critically and take careful notes.  Then just to make sure everyone is telling the same story, you'll share your notes with other passengers and crew members.
        You'll also have to look for clues.  You'll comb the ship, covering every deck, every room, and cubbyhole.  Once you obtain a piece of evidence, you'll examine it, comparing it with other clues and even questioning passengers about it.
        Finally, when you think you've figured out who done it, you'll make an accusation.  What will happen after that is, well, another mystery.

Controls:  Joystick - Button 0 can be used for all game play and Button 1 can                         be used on the decks ONLY to speed up the action.
           Keyboard - Cntrl-K will as usual, put the game in keyboard mode.

Cntrl-J returns to joystick mode.

Movement:  Joystick to the right goes right and to the left goes left.                     To get to the other side of the deck - move to the end and push the                joystick forward.                                                            To move upstairs and downstairs - move into stairwell, when asked to               go up or down, push button to say "yes" and move stick to say no.            To open doors and enter rooms - move in front of doors and push                    forward, to remain outside, quickly pull back on joystick.
