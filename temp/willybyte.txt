
WILLY BYTE IN THE DIGITAL DIMENSION (Educational Arcade)
Compatibility: 64K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, KB or joystick input, Mockingboard optional


     Like any true-blue computer nerd, you have probably wondered what REALLY goes on inside your Apple when the power is on and the bytes are humming. Thanks to Data Trek the mystery is solved as you, the indomitable Willy Byte, explore the wonders of the Digital Dimension.

     Since computers are no-nonsense machines your journey quickly develops into a mission: take one or more bytes of data from the keyboard, through the RAM, and store them on disk. Simple enough, except for the dastardly Hex Luthor, embodiment of glitchness. Hex's static charges, overheating, and magnetism constantly menace your efforts, sometimes forcing you to drop everything and rush over to restart a ragged clock or, even worse, repair the power supply. Your reward for success is a rating (based mainly on bytes moved and time used) and a chance to place among the "Top Eight", saved on disk.

     Supposedly an educational experience, "Willy Byte" is in fact a graphics/sound-effects spectacular surprisingly free of educational content. From slick packaging through the five smoothly executing arcades, the appeal here is strictly to the senses. Put away your thinking cap; and play this one for fun.
