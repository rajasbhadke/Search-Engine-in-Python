
     SHAWDOW HAWK ONE DOCS

THERE ARE TWO PHASES IN SHADOW HAWK ONE
TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC. THE GAME STARTS
IN THE STRATEGIC PHASE. YOUR MISSION IS
TO DESTROY ENEMY SHIPS IN THE TACTICAL
PHASE AND TO USE RAW MATERIALS CAPTURED
FROM MERCHANTS TO IMPROVE YOUR SHIP IN
THE STRATEGIC PHASE.

THE STRATEGIC COMMANDS ARE:

J - ACTIVATE JUMP. THEN, MOVE THE
    JOYSTICK CONTROLLED CURSOR TO WHERE
    YOU WANT TO MOVE. USE THE BUTTON TO
    JUMP. IF YOU WISH TO RETURN TO YOUR
    BASE, THEN HIT...
P - RETURN TO PLANET BASE. AFTER YOU
    HIT 'P', MOVE THE CURSOR TO YOUR
    BASE AND HIT THE BUTTON.
U - UNLOAD RAW MATERIALS. USE THIS TO
    UNLOAD RAW MATERIALS CAPTURED FROM
    MERCHANTS FROM THE SHADOW HAWK ONE
    TO YOUR BASE.
B - BUYING MODE. THIS OPTION WILL ALLOW
    YOU TO IMPROVE AND REPAIR THE
    SHADOW HAWK ONE.

TACTICAL PHASE COMMANDS:

0 - DRIFT. STOPS YOUR SHIP FROM MOVING
    IN SPACE.
# - MOVE. A NUMBER FROM 1-5 WILL ALLOW
    YOU TO MOVE. THE JOYSTICK WORKS
    LIKE AN AIRPLANE'S CONTROL STICK.
C - COMPUTER ON/OFF. TURNS THE FIRING
    CROSSHAIRS ON AND OFF.
S - SHIELD GENERATOR. REGENERATES YOUR
    SHIELD BEFORE EACH ATTACK.
T - TORPEDOES. CAUSES THE JOYSTICK
    BUTTON TO RELEASE POWERFUL, BUT
    LIMITED TORPEDOES.
D - DISRUPTORS. CAUSES THE JOYSTICK
    BUTTON TO REALEASE WEAK, BUT PLENT-
    IFUL DISRUPTOR BEAMS.
B - DROP BEACON. DROPS A BEACON WHICH
    WILL DETECT ENEMY SHIPS IN THE
    SECTOR & WILL SHOW THEM ON THE MAP.
M - SOLAR MAP. MOVES YOU TO THE STRAT-
    EGIC PHASE.
J - JUMP. SAME AS STRATEGIC PHASE.

POINT VALUES:

YOU WILL RECEIVE POINTS FOR EACH ENEMY
SHIP YOU DESTROY AND EACH MERCHANT YOU
CAPTURE. YOU'LL ALSO GET RAW MATERIALS
FOR EACH MERCHANT YOU CAPTURE.
