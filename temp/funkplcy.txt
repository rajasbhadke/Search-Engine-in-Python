General FunkNet Echo Mail Rules

1. All Echo conferences (areas) must have a host or moderator. In many
cases the NC will moderate areas until a good host or moderator is 
found. 

a> A host's responsibilities will be to promote conversation and try to 
   lean the users toward the topic of that area.
b> A moderator's responsibilities will be the same as above but will also
   inform a user if they are off topic and direct them back on topic.

  Hosts and moderators need not be sysops. Hosts are appointed by the 
Origin board's sysop with the approval of the Net Coordinator, or by the
Net Coordinator. If someone has an idea for an area, please send a message
to the NC and we will discuss it.

2. Flames, insults, and abusive remarks are not permitted in any
FunkNet echo area.  Flames are considered "Accessively Annoying
Behavior (AAB)" and are grounds for immediate twitting
(removal of user access privilages). These cases should be
referred to the Net Coordindinator.  Any FunkNet sysop who
engages in this type of behavior will be immediately removed from
the Net.

3. Messages should be kept on topic.  Off topic message posters
should be politely asked, by the host and the sysop from who's
board the message originated, to move his/her conversation to a
more appropriate area. Accessively disregarding request to move off
topic messages to another area is considered AAB and will be
handled by the Net Coordinator.

4. The discussion of participation in illegal activities is
extreamly off topic.  FunkNet representatives will cooperate
fully with any legal investigation by authorities in such
instances!  In other words, you can talk about prostitution,
drugs, black market guns, etc but not where to get them.

5. FunkNet Sysops, Hosts, and the Net Coordinators reserve the
right to deny access to FunkNet echo areas at anytime, for any
reason, without warning.  We also reserve the right to
change or add to the rules at any time (proper notification of
rule changes or additions should be made public before or at the 
time of implementataion, fair is fair......)

6. As of June 1st I, owner if FunkNet, chose James Tarpley and Cris
Egger to be ANCs (Assistant Net Coordinators) of FunkNet. This means
that any decisions pertaining to the Net will go through at least
one of them before acted upon.

7. Any ideas, problems or concerns can be taken to James or Cris if
it isn't possible to contact me.

8. No SysOp of FunkNet will at any time feed a non-FunkNet board
without administrative approval.

9. Have fun.  This rule is mandentory.... :)
