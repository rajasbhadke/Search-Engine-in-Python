ESSAGE : TEL-TEC IS HISTORY! 
Msg left by: SHARP RAZOR

This is to inform you all that Tel-Tec ((800)-323-3026) is now out of business 
it seems that more non-paying custumers were using their l.d. services than 
paying customers!!..oh well,they gave a shitty connection anyway!.....with all 
of the "new tracing equipment" now added on some services,the following is a 
list of major serivices and how they rate connection wise,and safety wise... con 
nection-wise...
1. Sprint (far and away)
2. Metrophone
3. MCI execunet
4. MCI
5. Travel-Net
6. LDX
...now..how well these companies can trace...
1. SPRINT
2.MCI
3.MCI Execunet
4.Metro
5.LDX
6.Travel-Net..
..note: This is based on my personal opinion and info i have on the various 
tracing abilities of each firm listed.....later....Sharp Razor>>

MESSAGE KNOWLEDGE IS POWER... 
Msg left by: JELLIED WATERMELON

I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS QUOTE FROM THOMAS JEFFERSON. THIS MESSAGE IS SEEN 
EVERY TIME YOU LOG ONTO THE PIRATE-80 (OF WHICH I USE THE 'DEMO').
THE QUOTE IS HORRIBLY INNACURATE. I USE A PARAPHRASE OF BIOC'S QUOTE ON COSMOS: 
ANY SHMUCK CAN HAVE KNOWLEDGE, BUT THE ONE WHO CAN USE IT HAS POWER 
OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. SO I PROPOSE A NEW SAYING...
THE APPLICATION OF KNOWLEDGE IS POWER

some shit about official use only and a # which is non-carrier which you can 
report"user problems"to. don't worry about it.first,press"@n"and you will be

that,press "nic" and .you will be given a menu. choose #4.then you will be 
given 3 options.take #3(a description of hosts by operating system.there a 
bunch of o.s.'s so coose one that sounds good like unix or telenet (which can 
be accessed through arpanet) .then press "quit."you will be sent back to the 
main accessing area.then press"@o "and the o.s. # of the system you want. 
some times you'll find that o.s. #'s may be whole trs.some of arpanet's o.s.'s

MESSAGE #71: YOU TOO CAN WRITE FOR TAP
Msg left by: THE PHREAK MANAGMENT

TAP issues #91 & #92 should be going to the printer's very shortly. They are 
going to be very interesting (from looking at the proofs). Tuc & I layed out 
issue #91 and #92 is allegedly going to be a special issue from an old SUPER 
phreak. Cheshire Catalyst, the managing editor, also layed out an issue which 
will probably be #93 (which will be mailed out with #94).if you have some GOOD 
articles that you would like to appear in TAP, you can follow the procedure 
outlined below:
[1] Write up your article (preferably in 50 columns) & proof read it!
[2] You can use the old method of sending it to the mail drop
                         -or-
    You can send it in Phreak Feedback [F], to BIOC AGENT 003, THE PHREAK 
    MANAGEMENT, or TUC. If it is upto par, it'll probably go into one of 
    the next issues. Check previous issues of TAP to see what type of 
    articles have already been published, etc.

Now, before I tell you something else, Subscription information, general 
information about TAP, and the address can be found in the G-section in
the Level 1 Phreak Philes C [2] [2] 1. It should be the 2nd file appropriately 
entitled "TAP"

Now, you can also send stuff directly to Cheshire Catalyst on this board. He 
logs on irregularly (last on July 28 as of this message) so I can't guarantee 
anything. Do not bog him down with alot of garbage (especially since his 
mailbox can only hold so much!).

Hope to see some GOOD articles soon!,

And Finally for the handful of demanding Super Phreaks:

public view.

There are also new philes in General Topics levels 1 [1] & 2 [8].

Access to higher phreak G-sections can be obtained in several ways such as 
uploading some good philes (they don't necessarily have to be yours), sending 
samples of COSMOS #s, Mainframe #s, & other interesting things in phreak 
feedback [E], outright bribery, sufficient bullshitting, etc...

MORE NEW PHILES COMING SOON!!! (such as the Esquire article: Secrets of the 
Little Blue Box).

Enjoy,
