Scottish Federation of anarchists

Anarchists,libertarian socialists and autonomous revolutionaries  in Scotland 
have mobilised in support of The Centre in Edinburgh and have formed a 
federation. The Scottish federation of anarchists will increase contacts within 
Scotland and aims to increase the knowledge of anarchists ideas and action 
within the working class.
    The SFA - move over football bureaucrats!- at present links groups and 
individuals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Falkirk district. There are also 
links with other anarchists/ libertarian socialists in Aberdeen, Stirling, 
Shetland and other parts of the Highlands. It includes revolutionaries connected
with Counter Information collective, Class War Federation and the Anarchist 
Communist Federation. 
   We have a wealth of experience including the Timex dispute and other 
industrial struggles; claimants and unemployed workers actions; community 
campaigns to defeat the poll tax, water privatisation, VAT on Fuel etc; 
anti-fascist action to smash the BNP & other fascists and racists; the production
of anarchist 'propaganda' including stickers (contact Glasgow); and individuals 
connected to Earth First roads struggles, animal liberation and non-profit use value in music.
   One day conferences to assist coordination of action and muutual aid are 
held every two months. To date two conferences have been convened in Edinburgh, 
with a third planned for October. You can contact the SFA or get involved with 
local groups by writing to the National Secretary (SFA) c/o POB 1008, Glasgow
