    As you explore the island, you willfind the map very helpful. The island
    is large and it's very easy to get ost.

    You will find a blank map on the wrcked ship. Be sure to take it with
    you everywhere. Use the map to keeptrack of where you are, where you
    have been, and to plot your path frm place to place.

    Each time you go to a new screen, that location on the map will be auto-
    matically charted for you. If you wnt to return to a place you visited
    earlier in the game, the map will hlp you to get there.

    of the island can help you survive.

    identify it by the way it looks to ou. Try your best to name it
