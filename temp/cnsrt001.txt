1.      Introduction

        Welcome to the Consortium.  This is the premier issue of a new
electronic "newsletter" that was formed with one purpose in mind,  the
free exchange of information.  Over the years,  there have been many 
such publications,  Phrack, 2600, cDc, etc.  We are in NO way trying to
compete or even COMPARE to these publications.  We're here to offer
information, amusement, knowledge and practical skills to anyone who
has the ability to obtain and read this newsletter. 

        The Consortium is not about hacking, phreaking, anarchy, explosives,
music, pirating, credit card fraud or any of the other "underground"
hobbies,  although it is highly likely that you'll find articles on
almost all of the above in the months (and hopefully years) to come.  

        Throughout the years,  the world of telecommunications has changed
drastically.  When I first entered the scene back in 1983, things were
different.  People were using BBS systems and the telecom world as a form
of communication,  a form of education,  and a hobby.  It wasn't a lifestyle,
it wasn't a medium to give everyone an alternate "fake" personality.  It 
was just there.  In the more recent years,  it seems the "newbies" have
gotten the idea that the whole invention of BBS systems were to allow them
to all log on an act like prepubescent assholes and get away with it.  
Hopefully,  we can educate them otherwise,  or the entire ideology of
telecommuncations as we know it may go down the tubes.  

        Well,  you've gotten the introduction,  you know what the Consortium
is about,  and you know what we're attempting to do.  You MUST excuse me if
the "look and feel" of this publication isn't up to par for the first few
issues,  we've got to get the writers going, and some ideas flowing and 
work on our entire appearance.  In any case.......

2.      You, UNIX and Password Security

    UNIX is very possibly the most secure operating system in existance...
if the administrators of a UNIX system are educated in the ways of proper
UNIX administration and security, that is.
    
    When a UNIX system is first set up, there are several different accounts
that come stock with the system. It's the responsibility of those setting the
system up to change the passwords of those accounts, remove those accounts,
or in some other way remove the accounts from public access. There are,
however, those uneducated system administrators, who are either unaware of 
these accounts, ignorant that there are information-seekers who would take
particular intrest in the access these accounts would provide, or just plain
lazy and are unwilling to bother with disabling access to these accounts.
Whatever the case may be, their loss is our gain. And what do we have to gain?
Information, education, and knowledge.

    Here is a listing of typical default accounts on UNIX systems. This
listing is bound to change from flavor to flavor. Some may work, none may
work, or every one may work. If you've got the patience (or ability to code)
then you're BOUND to find a crack or two if you try enough systems. (Username
and password are the same, unless specifically noted otherwise.)

adm, admin, ann, anon, anonymous, backup, batch, bin, checkfsys, daemon,
demo, diag, field, ftp, games, help, install, listen, lp, lpadmin, maint,
makefsys, mountfsys, network, news, nobody, nuucp, nuucpa, operator,
powerdown, printer, pub, public, reboot, rje, rlogin, root, sa, setup,
shutdown, startup, sync, sys, sysadm, sysadmin, sysman, system, tech,
test, trouble, tty, umountfsys, user, user1, uucp, uucpa, visitor,
guest/guest, guest/anonymous, sysbin/sysbin, sysbin/bin

    Once inside the system, be it with your own account or with one of the
ones listed above, you should probably scan for accounts that lack passwords.
The password file is in the /etc directory. The name of the file is passwd.
Every user has access to read this file, yet select few have access to write
to it. For our purposes, you only need to be able to read it.
    
    A typical account entry would look something like the following:

two:wfllbtdq:100:100:Two Face:/usr/two:/usr/ucb/csh
(1)  (2)     (3) (4)  (4)      (5)      (6)

    It may help some to explain exactly what the line above means. To help,
each field has been numbered, and will be explained.
    
    The first field is the username. The second field is the encrypted
password. The third field is the user id (file ownership is based on a
user number that is unique to each user, as opposed to the actual username.
While it's an impersonal method of file ownership, it's rather effective...)
The fourth field is the group id (which works the same way as individual
file ownership, except for that it applies to all users in a particular
group...) The fifth field is the user's home directory. The sixth field is
the startup program. We only need to be concerned with the first two fields,
however.
    
    As you can see, each field is sepperated by the : symbol. If this account
was not password protected, the line would look like this:

two::100:100:Two Face:/usr/two:/usr/ucb/csh

    UNIX comes with a program called grep. What grep does is search any given
file(s) for a user-specified string. In this case, we want it to search for
any occurance of :: in the passwd file. Once logged into the system, run this
command:

grep :: /etc/passwd

    Any line(s) that grep outputs for you are accounts that lack passwords.
Some SysAdmins don't allow for null passwords, though it IS worth the effort
to at least check to see if any unprotected accounts work.
    
    If you know of any other interesting tricks involving password security
on UNIX based systems, or happen to have a listing of what function each
telnet port serves, please send mail to ed@gnu.ai.mit.edu

3.      The Misrepresentation of Telecommuncations Enthusiasts.

     It is not a new thing, nor is it something that will go away
anytime soon.  For years we have been subject of many "attacks"
coming from mainstream media sources.  Many major magazines like
Time, and many television programs such as Dateline have given
telecommunications a bad name.  They have done this by allowing
small factions of "concerned citizens" to use their shows as a
medium for their own over active imaginations.  These shows and
others are explaining to the already clay-like entities watching
them that there are many bad types on large networks, and even
some smaller BBSes.  These shows have come up with every
conceivable person that COULD be accessing a modem from a 
pedophile to Neo-Nazi's.  This is not a joke.  These shows always
seem to air late at night, when any respectable computer user is
hacking away on a new program working out the latest bugs. 
However, as most computer users find no time to get to their
T.V. sets during the day, their parents however, may be glued to
it.  For it is truly the media of their generation.  When an
advertisement appears for a show stating something about what
THEIR child may be party to, they WILL listen.  These shows like
all T.V. shows have a captive audience.  These shows can tell
people whatever it is they wish them to believe, and the
uninformed WILL believe it. These programs and articles do not
even take the time to allude to the fact that these "bad people"
are a very small faction of users. Most users in the BBS world
have never been a subject to this.
     
     Another annoying article I read in Time Magazine a month ago
was called 'Scribes on the Internet'.  This explained that with
the onslaught of new users making their way to the internet, most
of these users were spelling, and grammatically challenged. 
 This is a fact that most Bulletin Board Users have to deal with
constantly.  The 3l33t3 d00d speak like this that annoys almost
all BBS users with a clue, is portrayed as the new way of the
virtual world.  I am insulted.  Whereas I am not the greatest
grammar freak, I *NEVER* spoke in the K00L, or KEWL manner.  I
thought it was completely stupid.  If you even tried this on a
Bulletin Board in this area you would most likely lose access if
you did not and I quote "Get a clue."

     If I am wrong about this then I am living a sheltered life. 
I have never used AOL, why WOULD I?  I have however used the
original AOL, Q-LINK, which was much the same.  Neither I nor
anyone I know that does access pay on-line services has seen this
type of thing happening.  Though, with the large on-line services
around, I believe it occurs.  It does not however occur on any
local bulletin boards that I have access to.  As you read this
article think to yourself, If you are a real user then you
probably use on-line services very little.  If you do, or do not,
have you ever seen or been victim to such acts?  Are there any
local Neo-Nazi BBSes in YOUR area?  The on-line world is NOT a
new frontier, it was almost completely plotted when I joined it,
and that was 10 years ago.  These people do not take the time to
see how the real Telecommunications world works.  Most of the
users on my BBS know who I am, and vice versa.  In fact, I hang
out with most of the Bulletin Board users I know.  We have formed
many friendships on-line, and broken many also.  
     
     If you are a young user, under the age of 18, think about
this.  If you think I am right, take the time to educate your
parents.  How can they understand something of this magnitude? 
NEVER in their lives has anything such as this on this scale
happened.  I applaud all attempts of the older generation to
learn about computers and the on-line world.  We should help them
to understand it is not a haven for punks, and criminals. 
However, to quote probably what your parents think, we have to
raise them OUR way.  We cannot allow them to take their own paths
in this new area for them, if they do they will mess up.  They
will start to form groups such as Prodigy, AOL, CompuServe,
things that have no place in the on-line world.  I am not
against having pay services, and even to make some money off
them, but do not take every bit you can get from it.  The on-line
world is here for one purpose, and one purpose only, "The free
exchange of information" -RBBS.

     This type of show is typical of the news media.  They will
try to discredit all forms of media that are not in the
mainstream media.  Bulletin Boards are very much media in many
ways.  News can be found on-line, along with information on
movies, bands, new albums, etc.  There are also many, many forms
of entertainment that just cannot be equaled by an outside force
like media.  T.V. ratings dropped when computers started offering
games, and other miraculous toys to play with.  Why would the
media want that?  Power, and ratings are the two driving goals
of media.  With the arrival of the modem, and widespread
telecommunications we are now able to get news immediately. 
Also, who are you more likely to trust?  The news that states a
movie is the best thing since The Rocky Horror Picture Show?  Or,
your on-line friends who watched it and told you it sucked beyond
belief?  You tell me...

4.      My Life At The Revival Tent:
                 
                 Safe Sex, Cereal, and Subliminal Islam

               By Iesu Christe Dominae

       It was far too early for any soon-to-be high school junior to have to
wake up in the foggy midst of summer . Seven O'Clock A.M. was a time that had
long since slipped into obscurity by one August 3rd, 1994, the summer in full
swing and myself destined at that ungodly hour to shit, shower and shave for
Lollapalooza '94, where I would dazzle the masses alongside my poetic con-
temporaries in the enigmatic Revival Tent.

       We had planned it all out: us poetry people would all meet at roughly
8:30-9:00 outside Fellini's cafe on Wickenden St. in East Providence, where 
we would have a quick strategic conference and cement our general lack of 
knowledge as to the procedure we would follow once we actually got to 
'Palooza. That portion went off almost without a hitch, with the possible 
exception of our leaving a half hour later than we planned. Things could 
have been much, much worse.

       We all broke into our little car pools. I was riding with Dawn Gabriel
(a member of the infamous telcom-havoc-wreaking Gabriel clan) and Ray Davey,
host of the Providence Poetry Slam Series at AS220 (and accomplished 
performance poet in his own right,) with local legend Derrick Prosper 
(veteran of innumerable slam championships) following us to Quonset State 
Airport in his dilapidated Honda. Also hauling ass into North Kingstown were 
Worcester hellraisers Otis Galloway, Bill MacMillan (host of the Worcester 
slams at Eleni's cafe), and Diane "Bucking Hips" Brown: The Virgin Poet, 
Sean Shea: fellow minors Mary Geisser and Mark Krauss: and some other 
people whose names I always seemed to miss.

       Our car arrived at Quonset to be greeted by the most submoronic 
security staff ever to don blue shirts. After being deftly pointed on our 
way by R.I.'s finest (a small gaggle of State Troopers whose concentration 
was rather inefficiently split between shooting the shit and directing 
traffic) we set out in search of Gate 7, the fabled Vendor's gate. Luckily, 
the planets were correctly aligned and we found it (with a little help from 
the white-shirted 'Palooza touring security.) Here's a little hint: if you 
wanna get into a show like Lolla (with spoken word) for free, ask around 
about the Vendor's gate and attempt entry by saying "We're poets." They're 
apparently some kind of magic incantation, because it got us through with 
nary a question. We created our own parking space some distance from 
backstage and set out in search of our passes.

       Saints be praised, we eventually found our contact - after being 
consistently misguided by the same security guard. (I've advanced the 
theory that they just hire one or two actual security guards and clone 
them. The fuckers all look alike.) As Ray went into the exceptionally large 
Greyhound bus discreetly labeled "Mindfield Production Office", something 
happened.

       A woman (about 5'4", with shoulder length brown hair) was making her 
way toward the bus. As she opened one of the side compartments and began 
retrieving luggage, I realized who this was - possibly one of my favorite 
spoken-word performers alive, Maggie Estep. Rather than behaving like a 
gibbering fanboy, I decided that I would take the quietly respectful 
approach.

       As she was dragging a large flight bag across the dew tip'd grass, I
worked my way in front of her. "So this is the sex goddess of the 20th 
century," I said, grossly misquoting a poem of hers. She grinned a 
half-cocked grin at me. Slowly, I extended a fist toward her.

       "Po-TA-to," I said.

       "WHAT?" she replied incredulously.

       "Po-TA-to," I insisted.

       "I'm tired. Don't confuse me."

       I briefly and akwardly illustrated "potato."

       "Now what?" she inquired.

       "That's it." I walked away, strangely pleased with myself.

 We got our neato little patches and rejoined the rest of our caravan,
who were already congregated with the Boston people at the enigmatic Revival
Tent. We were greeted by the soothing sounds of one of the road poets, Uncle
Shappy, doing impromptu Karaoke to to some hideous 70's music playing over 
the tent's sound system. Meanwhile, the crowds at the gates were swelling 
like a cancerous tumor on this formerly peaceful airstrip. After a half hour, 
some tangoing, and more Karaoke than is ordinarily humanly bearable, we had 
a brief strategic meeting and then went about corraling an audience from the 
masses now milling about Quonset. To this end, Bill took the cordless 
microphone and went out into the crowd, promising that "If I get a hundred 
people in this tent in the next 10 minutes, I will walk from here to the 
main stage naked!" I must confess, I haven't seen any kind of tent fill up 
that fast since Guantanamo the last time Castro opened the borders. Liz, a 
road poet, pulled people out of the audience and asked them "What band are 
you here to see?", "Can you recite some lyrics from that band?", etc. And 
while Bill never had an opportunity to make good on his previous promise, 
an audience member had that same general idea - he walked onto the stage, 
completely naked, to be interviewed by Liz. Most of the neo-alt preppies 
there gawked embarassingly as he wandered back out into the crowd, while 
two security guards laughed their asses off not 30 feet away from him. We 
didn't see him again.


     Bill opened a round of "Round Robin" (poets pass the mic, read a poem, 
pass the mic to someone else). I took that chance to read "My name is Henry"
and the infamous Fabio poem to the expectant crowd. Otis followed my porno-
graphic tirade with a poem about using a condom, during which I fished some
out of the big prop box and passed them out. Eventually, however, the Bore-
doms won out over the tent for me, and I went off stageward to groove to 
their funky Japanese hardcore beat (the three words that they know in English
are "Fuck" and "Thank you") under the influence of a free Smart Drink that
Dawn, Mary and I coaxed out of a bombed Mindfield employee (who looked un-
cannily like Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots fame.) When next I saw the tent, 
the road poet posse were rocking the mic (verily, fuckin' shit up. (That's a 
good thing.)) 

     After some wandering the in the pretentious, overpriced "Mindfield," I 
found my buddy Jubb (in addition to running into an ex-girlfriend - something
I can never seem to avoid doing.) We hung out for a long time, and I brought
him back to the tent where we watched some more road and local poets jam. 
By some freakish chance, I was selected to participate in some travesty called
a "Dating Game." Well, the unfortunate thing about that is that, though blind-
folded, I recognized the voices (and/or clothing/physical accessories) of all
the "bachelorettes", and most of them were either complete warthogs or raging 
morons. I got a free T-shirt, though. 


     The next attraction of notice was a performance artist named Gorby, who 
did a bizarre act involving a length of rope, a Sprite can, and a story about 
his ex-girlfriend of seven years. What he did, in effect, was slowly strangle
himself with the rope while talking about her obsession with control. When 
the story hit a lull, he kicked the can into the audience where it spewed
warm Sprite in all directions. It was beautiful.

     Next that I remember, Uncle Shappy did a performance (piece with Sean 
on flutophone) detailing the harrowing, angsty tale of a nightmarish break-
fast of Captain Crunch with John Tesh. One would have to see it to truly
understand it. Afterwards, random attractions came onstage, including a 
staggeringly brilliant urban slam poetry/rap combo from N.Y.C called the
Boom Poetic, whose sole source of rhythm (or "Boom", if you prefer) was the
man named Razelle, who could make noises with his mouth that no drum machine
weighing down the face of the planet could ever duplicate. 

     Finally, it came down to the reason that I was there. The poetry slam. 
Prize: 100$. Result: Getting completely shafted. First of all, there were 
only two rounds - one of which had apparently happened while I was with Jubb
in the Mindfield or avoiding Nick Cave's horrible mushy renditions of his
mediocre volume of album material. Secondly, they would only pick the absolute
top score of both rounds, and pit the winners of each against one another. 
This is not a sound plan with sixteen competitors. I obviously didn't win. 
After they closed down the tent, I stashed my belongings with some Anti-
Woodstock independent publishers, watched some more Boredoms on the second 
stage, and then shipped off to beat on people during the Beastie Boys. It was
endless fun. 

     During the next break, I found Jubb and hung out with him and Gorby to 
help him sell what Gorby termed "tacky shit." "Come get your tacky shit here!"
"Real USDA approved tacky shit!" That type of thing. Come to think of it, 
Gorby looked almost exactly like Jeff Fahey in The Lawnmower Man. Bizarre. 
Then: Smashing Pumpkins. 

     The Pumpkins were a wee bit disappointing for a few reasons: playing far
too many Siamese Dreams songs far too fast, and far too much apologizing for
"sucking." I have to say that "I am one" and "Rhinocerous" were almost redemp-
tion. Almost. But I still had a damn good time with some guys who I kept run-
ning into there, who always seemed to have pit following on their heels. 

Next time, Part Two: The Ride Home.

5.      Introduction / LOCNet Application

          How did LOCnet begin?

     Nearly 2 years ago, RS-232 and I spoke on the phone plotting 
our plans to take over the universe as a whole.  When we decided 
that wouldn't work, we turned to the idea of starting a small 
network to solve some of the activity problems on his board.

     Neither of us had the slightest clue as to HOW to start a 
network up.  I decided it would be best to ask the resident expert 
on WWIV and the net related issues involved.  His name was Sarik 
Malthus.

     Early that afternoon, I logged onto the Imperium, Sarik 
Malthus's abode.  After fruitlessly attempting to chat with the 
Dark Lord, I decided to leave Feedback.  Contained within were 
words that were much like the following.

              Hi Alex.  Could you tell me how I could set up a
              net?

     I waited.  A few hours later, I called back and met a most 
frustrating reply.

              Read the DOCs.

     Read the DOCs?  I waited all this time for "Read the DOCs"?  
So, being the stubborn person I am, I replied :

              Fine.  Thanks.

     I then logged off.  Alot of good THAT did.  Little did I know 
that those words were some of the wisest words ever written to me 
in the BBS world.

     By now, it was late.  I decided to print out the WWIVnet 
documentation and read it.  Hell, why not?  It didn't seem like 
anyone was actually going to come right out and tell me what I 
needed to know.  So I read.  I screwed around.  I read some more.  
I screwed around some more.  Eventually, I got the LOCnet 
information files to compile correctly.  In the process, I learned 
more about the net software than I thought possible.  I slept.

     The next day, RS-232 and I decided to attempt to get his 
board hooked up.  He was running VBBS.  It was WWIVnet compatible, 
it just needed a little tweaking.  It was also horribly slow.  
Eventually he figured out how to get it to work and LOCnet was 
born.  2 nodes, both at 2400 baud.

     LOCnet has since grown a bit.  It's gained and lost boards 
here and there.  There are currently 9 boards that span a decent 
sized portion of Rhode Island.

     Following this rather dull article is a short network 
application for LOCnet.  You can E-Mail it to any of the addresses 
listed at the bottom of the application.

If you're interrested in joining LOCnet and you run (or plan to run) a WWIVnet
compatible BBS, fill out the follofing application and E-Mail it to one of the
sites listed in the end of the application.

6.      Boxing Tone Reference Guide


        Red Box, Blue Box, Green Box, Blotto Box...  Half of them have
   turned into telecom novelty items.  This is a simple list of the
   frequencies needed for a few of the more popular boxes that are still
   workable in areas of the country today.  A lot of people out there
   are not technically inclined enough to make an actual red box out
   of a Radio Shack dialer or convert a white box to a blue box,  yet
   they have the talent to write a program to generate the same tones.

        These tones can be recorded and used just as a normal box would
   be used.  However,  the actual application of this information is
   illegal,  and we wouldn't want anyone breaking the law.

        The timing durations used on these tones are as follows.  One
   second is represented as a duration of 18.2.  The durations are fractions
   of this 18.2 cycle second.

Red Box:

        Nickel:         1700Mhz + 2200Mhz
                        Duration 1 on

        Dime:           1700Mhz + 2200Mhz
                        Duration 1 on, 1 off
                        2 Repetitions

        Quarter:        1700Mhz + 2200Mhz
                        Duration .4 on, 1 off
                        5 Repetitions

Blue Box:

        Digit 1:        900Mhz + 700Mhz
        Digit 2:        1100Mhz+ 700Mhz
        Digit 3:        1100Mhz+ 900Mhz
        Digit 4:        1400Mhz+ 700Mhz
        Digit 5:        1300Mhz+ 900Mhz
        Digit 6:        1300Mhz+1100Mhz
        Digit 7:        1500Mhz+ 700Mhz
        Digit 8:        1500Mhz+ 900Mhz
        Digit 9:        1500Mhz+1100Mhz
        Digit 0:        1300Mhz+1500Mhz
        KP     :        1700Mhz+1100Mhz
        ST     :        1700Mhz+1500Mhz


Autovon:

        Signal A:       697Mhz + 1633Mhz
        Signal B:       770Mhz + 1633Mhz
        Signal C:       852Mhz + 1633Mhz
        Signal D:       941Mhz + 1633Mhz


White Box:

        Digit 1:        1209Mhz+ 697Mhz
        Digit 2:        1336Mhz+ 697Mhz
        Digit 3:        1147Mhz+ 697Mhz
        Digit 4:        1209Mhz+ 770Mhz
        Digit 5:        1336Mhz+ 770Mhz
        Digit 6:        1147Mhz+ 770Mhz
        Digit 7:        1209Mhz+ 852Mhz
        Digit 8:        1336Mhz+ 852Mhz
        Digit 9:        1147Mhz+ 852Mhz
        Digit 0:         941Mhz+1336Mhz

        Well,  that's all I have for you now.  Maybe i'll do my own 
  dictionary of what all the box types are.  (The worthwhile ones that
  actually worked at some point in history).  Stay tuned.
