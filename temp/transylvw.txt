                            (Penguin Software)


FIRST A FEW POINTS:

1:  WHEN THE WEREWOLF APPEARS YOU HAVE ONLY ONE MOVE TO GET RID  OF HIM, SO
GO TO ANOTHER LOCATION IMMEDIATELY.

2:  WHEN  A GIANT EAGLE APPEARS WHICH TRANSPORTS YOU TO ANOTHER LOCATION IN
THE GAME, YOU MUST START YOUR GAME OVER AT YOUR LAST SAVE POSITION, SO SAVE
YOUR GAME FREQUENTLY.

3:  IF  YOU  HAVE  LOADED  YOUR GUN WITH THE SILVER BULLET AND THE WEREWOLF
APPEARS: "SHOOT WEREWOLF" AND HE MAKES NO PROBLEMS IN THIS ADVENTURE.

4:  IN  THE CASTLE, IF YOU MEET THE VAMPIRE, JUST SHOW THE CROSS TO HIM AND
THEN DROP THE CROSS.
