_____________________________________________________________________________


Hello, with the release of ProTERM v1.9p (only a few steps from 2.0) there
have been a couple of noted problems and concerns.

Number 1; It still does not have a USRobotics HST driver in the configuration
        program.  Well this problem has already been solved.  Myers (of The
        9600 Club) re-wrote the drivers to work correctly.  I just put up the
        Super Serial Card one, the Modem Port one is done but I have yet to
        upload it.  They both work.  Remember patch for v1.2 will not work
        with v1.9p.  Don't bother trying it, their formats are different.

Number 2; The editor DOES work.  It can save text/appleworks format (and it
        works fine)  It is extremely radical.  I like it better than
        Appleworks. The editor is version 2.0, the program is v1.9p. (like I
        said, only a few steps away)

Number 3; Greg has fixed many a little upsetting things on proterm.  For
        example, when dialing after few seconds your modem doesn't connect
        for whatever reason it will keep that boards dial screen there.
        (instead of returning you to the board list)

Number 4; It supports Y-modem CRC when downloading.  This will not speed
        anything up, but will have better error checking.  Transit finally
        works.  It fairly fast too!

Number 5; ** THE MOST IMPORTANT ** ProTERM supports mousetext and a sound
        generator, this is a terminal emulation.  Like VT-100 and Datamedia
        are.  This is UNREAL!!

        What is mousetext?  Remember when you got your //e enhanced about
        a year ago?  And Appleworks could show like open and closed Apples at
        the main menu!  This will revolutionize bulletin boards.

        ONLY WITH PROTERM V1.9 - V2.0
        -----------------------------

        The Sound Generator --> Supports pitch, tempo, tone. It is feasible
        to actually write a song that could be sent over the phone to the
        person on the other it.

        ITS TERMINAL EMULATION:  ProTERM Special, so configure your system to
        that.

        Compatibility: Semi-compatible with Datamedia 1500.  It uses
                        the same hi and lo lite control characters (inverse)
                        left, right, down are the same.  The rest are all
                        different. (except for control-g of course)

(*note: the up control character is ^K (just like the arrows))

        The Future: You'll be using your mouse pretty soon if Greg keeps
                this up.  Learn to use these radical terminal emulations,
                you'll find boards can and will be MUCH better.

        The First: The first board in the world supports mousetext/ProTERM
                special emulation.

                                Brave New World

                                 BBS/Y-xmodem

                                  12/24/9600

                                     15meg

                [Apple*link - Datamedia 1500, ProTERM Special]

                              [ProTERM Emulator]

                                 617-849-0644
                                    (come and see mousetext in action.)


Thank you very much, this is very important.  Would you like to use mousetext
and the sound generator in your system?  I will release a text file soon with
all the compatible control characters.

For making this information possible (and alerting me to the fact that
proTERM special emulation is powerful):  Ralph Kramden

and the person on the line while I figured it out: Sound Wave, thanks for the
moral support. (haha)

You saw it here first on Ray's ProTAC.

thanks,

  Sorry Marytr, but yours is not the first board to use moustext.  It's been
done' lots of times.  And nobody will use 1.9 anyhow, as it does not work
with the hst patch!  Just the poor old slobs with 2400 or less.

ProTERM 1.9p WILL work with 1.2's macros and dial files just transfer PT.DIAL
and PT.MACRO over and use them the PT.BIOS file is not compatable, however.
The major bug in 1.9p that I have noticed is that it will NOT append to an
existing text file. If you have Autocopy on and the buffer fills and writes
to the disk that is all that will be written to the disk. It will try and
write to the same file and croak. Also there are NO error messages displayed
when trying to Append and it aborts or when trying to write to a Write
Protected disk.

Name one.

Everyone says that, but no one can name ONE FUCKING board.  That has
supported mousetext from the users side.

I know boardworks shows it on the sysops side but not to the user.  Mainly
because Mousetalk, nor AE nor ProTERM have had the capability of receiving
them.  AE has at times because of a random floating emulation bug it had.  In
which if you hit control-reset, it would go into inverse and display
mousetext.

Back up these statements.  Don't post a two line thing, not proving a damn
thing.


Going up, ProTERM Special Control Characters put together by The 9600 Club.
Support this powerful emulation in your own board.

   I do believe that this very board once supported mouse text before it
switched software.  And do not go around telling people that they have not
seen what they know they have.  I don't appreciate having you tell me that I
imagined seeing stupid mousetext on a bbs.  Besides, what good is it in a
bbs? It was meant to create a mac like interface with text programs.  How
well can that work in a bbs?

  If I remember correctly there is a software  package out called boardworks
or something similar that was in use a year ago.  It allowed mousetext.

  In addition, that very last thing I want to see is a bunch of Brave New
World clone boards all over the place.(how fitting)

Boy you have a good memory Mobius.  Yes, I was just about to post that I used
plenty of moustext and inverse for a good six months or longer when running
AE:TAC.  Only drawbacks where that most users didn't know enough to delete a
few filter characters out of their list to see it, with half the reason being
that the trash starts your screen inverse and mousetext by itself and really
gets anoying.  (Any new terminal programs that are going to support mousetext
and inverse should have an "Normal" key so that if trash turns on inverse
and/or mousetext, it can be "put" back to normal easily from the users side.
Since we have error checking at 9600, we shouldn't have any problems with
extra trash causing us to go into mousetext/inverse, but the 2400 baud users
will probably have a few problems with it...  (Unless they own a 2400 with
MNP-3 error correction like the Courier 2400e, but hardly anyone does because
they cost to much more than they are probably worth acording to the user.)
(Although I love "no-trash" lines because of the error correction, not
letting a bit of trash through)

About the Tone feature of ProTERM, that really sounds intriguing.  (To
Martyr, you metioned being able to control pitch/tone/volume or some three
variables, but in the text file it just shows ^T and ^TT for short or long
beep.  Will there be another text file on just how to use the tone/music
portion of ProTERM 1.9/2.0?  It does give a new dimension to boards to be
able to use tone/music!
Great job to all the users who are involved in experimenting and learning more about the tone/music portion!  (And I thank the The Martyr for comming
out with the text file on how to use the other special emulation controls.)

Let me stage my defense.  First of all dewd, I never said you imagined seeing
it.  I wanted someone to name one board, thats all.  Because people kept
saying "Oh its been done before, its been done before," never saying which
board.
Which control code turned it on in ASCII Express? (again, I am asking a
simple question, not attacking)

Mobius, you are crazy.  You don't think the ProTERM Special Emulation is
useful?  You must enjoy bland boards, like Tele-Cat and GBBS, which no
emulation at all.  No scrolling menus, no nothing.  Then thats your problem.
Don't call Brave New World, if you don't like it.

Metal Cat, whats up?  Why so crude in your about message? "burst your bubble"
I believe the saying goes.  That was uncalled for.  All I asked was for
someone to name some boards.

BOARDWORKS DOES NOT SUPPORT MOUSETEXT ON THE USERS SIDE! ONLY ON THE SYSOPS
SIDE. I know the guy who wrote it fairly well.

Is it save for me to say the boards were few and far between?

Why is it people keep secrets of this.  Plently of people would have liked to
implement mousetext in their systems.  But NO, a random few sysops who figure
it out, keep quiet.  Now six months later, myself not knowing of any previous
boards supporting mousetext, since no one has ever mentioned it in the past.

It was my mistake, "First ProDOS board to have mousetext"
                   "First ACOS system to have mousetext"
                   "First board to support ProTERM Special"

are those more valid for you?

Also in my introduction of ProTERM Special emulation, I made this exact
statement.


"       The First:  the first board in the world to support mousetext/proTERM
                special emulation.

                                Brave New World"


I guess, I made a fairly correct statement my boys.

"..support mousetext/ProTERM special emulation"
           ------------------

Notice the "/"?


In other words, I simply stated BNW was the first board to support mousetext
using ProTERM Special emulation.


Read closely, you'll see I am not mistaken in that part.  Someone trys to
notify people that proterm special emulation exists and they come back with
rude "burst your bubble" statements.

   There was once a board called "The Realm of Inconsistency" that used
mousetext in gbbs.  So that eliminates: "First ProDOS board to have moustext"
                                    and "First ACOS system to have mousetext"

   Of course you could only see it with mousetalk or ae....

I had a board up called the Potato Patch up in 1985 that not required
XX.Propacker files be used, but also had MouseText for use with AE.

Here's what you need to know for AE MouseText (as if anybody's going to use
it):

ESC:  Turn on MouseText
^O :  Turn on Inverse  (Inverse MouseText A=Apple)
^X :  Turn off MouseText
^N :  Turn off Inverse

Voila!

But thankx for distributing it around, and making it available.  I love
mousetext, and thought it was a stinking stupid idea to take it out in the
first place.  Sound would be nice, but I don't give a fuck about PT 1.3+
until a new GS MODEM PORT HST Driver comes out.  Fuck SSC.

Realm of Inco.  was the lamest board on earth.  It was up for about 3 days.
There a "little bubble burst" for yourself Dave.

So don't go around babbling about how wonderful you board was, since no one
called it on its 3 days of life.  Poor, poor example dork.

That re-activates "First ACOS, First ProDOS!"

Well, just to put in my 20 cents worth here, I'd just like to say that the
Mousetext looks pretty spiffy. What I can't see is why you guys are slamming
each other around over such a lame problem. Big fucking deal if BNW, or here
or anywhere is the FIRST, It's nice and all, but it doesnt seem to serve any
purpose. Although I must say that BNW is one of my favorite systems anyway,
and I wouldnt give a shit if it had mousetext or what not.

I hope nobody thinks that i'm trying to get into the neck biting of the "i'm
first i'm first" argument.  I understand what The Martyr ment by he was the
first to support it for ProTERM.  And I also appreciate him making up a text
file about it and uploading it so that other sysops can implement it into our
systems to improve the looks.  (What it going to look like calling with TIC
like some users like to use?  Just extra characters like a 2 years ago when
Mousetext and AE:PRO became popular?

Other question I would like answered is if anyone knows how to change pitch
and etc on the sound for ProTERM special emulation.  Is there only two
(high/low) pitches we can use, or is it really music that we can send?  Is
this possible and sysops are just keeping quiet about it, or is it more like
high/low pitch music?

        Take it easy,

        Sting

Martyr, the reason I said "sorry to burts you bubble" is becuase the way you
question was written "Name one other board, dont just say there were others".
I interperated it as you saying, yea right, you all say youve seen mousetext
but i doubt it.  Thats the way >> I << saw it, i dunno about anyone else. And
another thing thats just my opinion, if a board goes up with mousetext like
that realm of whatever the hell the name is, even for a few days, it still
had mousetext and it still was in prodos and in acos, but hey, thats just
>> my << opinion, and I know you could care less about my opinion just like I
could care less about yours. But anyway.

 Does anyone have a normal working hacker for the GS and HST? I tried HCS,
Hackamatic, Code Crusher, Hack THIS Buddy, Intellihacker, and all of them
just sit there and do nothing after dialing the 950 or whatever, do i hafta
have something set in the control panel, or a dip switch a certain way?
AARGH!

So far, you are the biggest pain in the ass.  The only fucking idiot that
would upload "GBBS.LOCKUP.HST" would be yourself.  Now if some guy has
something against Sting Ray, he could wreck his board by calling up and
locking it up.

What's Jesus got to do with it dude?

The only way to get the info to sysops is to post a public anouncement of it.
Are you telling me you've never heard of this bug?  I may have underestimated
to which portion the info was released to.  I was once a Sysop and Sting Ray
use to be on my board...  We know each other well.  Back in the Apple ][+
days before the IIe and IIc ever came about.  The information I put forward
is to alert sysops of the bug.  Every single one of them.  Before hand, it
was rumors and talked about between hackers who liked to freeze systems.
Your telling me I should of just let them keep freezing systems up?  If I
give the info to a few sysops, they will use it to trade or limit the info so
that not all sysops get it.  Thereby allowing "bad" sysops to gain pleasure
in "Torturing" other boards.  The only fair conclusion I came to was to post
a totally public announcement so the information could be read by all.  I
don't think you have misunderstood the situation.  It is fixable, and the
latest Roms do fix this problem.  I'm just alerting the sysops to the fact
the matter exists and how to fix it.  You had a better way?  Totally
informing every sysop was the only fair conclusion I could come up with, and
of course a fix for it.  I could make files of other ways to lock up GBBS
PRO/ACOS boards but since the sysops i've spoken with haven't reported any
other lockup problems, I find it best to keep quiet about it.

Your calling me an idiot and a pain in the ass?  Only conclusion I can come
up with is that your imature and stuckup.  Your the ONLY one that seems to
have a problem with this...  Maybe that message a few back should of been
addressed to you.  Cut off my connections?  Hah, i'd like to see you try
dude.  Your just a little kid who runs a board.  I can easily change alias
and go anywhere I want. I never use my voice phone # and get on wherever I
want.  I am here to inform sysops of the problem, not condone freezing up the
boards, that's why I'M TELLING SYSOPS how to fix the problem.  I could of
easily kept my mouth shut and just stayed with the hackers and lockup boards.
Is this what you think I should of done?  I've been a sysop and in the BBS
world since 1981, how about you dude?

Anyone else on this board have problems getting along with this guy?  He has
some type of ego trip or something??  I shouldn't of said that, but if he is
going to call me names like a little kid, then why not??  He use to be in a
rag message with his voice phone #, and it's easy for phreaks to get voice
phone #s after you've changed them to private.  You want to put up a fight,
i'm ready, but take a look back, your the one who started it.  I NEVER
mentioned your name in any message, and you took it apon yourself to put me
down and threaten me, so what choice to I have besides defend myself?

Anyone else agree or disagree with this?  I'm open to all input from other
users...  I would like to see more users voice their opinion, but I feel they
are afraid of you deleting them from your board or something if they spoke
up.

Dude, Jesus has more to do with it than you do..  Atleast he had half a brain
unlike yourself.  No, I have no plan of deleting anyone.  If you called my
board right now, I'd validate you.

See, you just think your a stud.  Calling me a "little kid" and like.  I bet
you $10, I am probably older than you.  I'll be you $100 I have owned a modem
longer than you.  I'll bet $1,000,000 that I have been involved in more
"rags" then you have.  These are things I am NOT proud of, just generalized
facts.

I do not your shit.  Your "GBBS Lockup" information was written in the form,
"modem geek can get revenge on sysop" and the like. (with random "haha"
throughout the file)  So don't play the chords and tell me it was written to
warn sysops.

You seem to want to fuck around, then thats your problem.  

Thus I cannot agee with "thats why I'm TELLING SYSOPS how to fix the
problem."
I don't think your message was directed in that light.

Yes, I agree with you dead meat.  He sounds like a little stuckup child the
way he calls you names, and a hot headed person.  I'll bet you he even
bitches back and forth with his parents.  It's probably a heredity trait.
Reminds me of some New York guys who just think they are right all the time
and can never say they where wrong.  Reason i'm posting is because i'm not on
his board and never plan to be, so i'm not afraid of getting kicked off.

You may of mislooked one thing though.  He probably has the older HST modem
and doesn't want to upgrade it, so now all his enemies can lockup his board.
That's probably why he is so mad.  I've heard of the rumor, but now everyone
should know and will probably upgrade.

Boy do I get a kick out of discussing this guy.  First you insult me just
because I opened my mouth to give my opinion, which wasn't directed an
ANYONE, in fact the message is still back about 15 and is posted to All as
you can plainly see, then you want to play some kind of why your better than
I am?

Should we compaire how many times we've had sex with a female, or how many
girl friends we've had, or maybe how many times we have both been in a bar?
All you want to do is put me down in any way you can.  It started with my
voicing my opinion in a message to all, and ended up with a file I wrote
about which is being spread around to all the sysops just like I planned.

I'll take you up on your first two bets.  I had a computer like I stated
before in messages back in 1981.  It was an Apple ][+.  I talked my parents
in getting it while I was a sophomore in H.S.  (I can remember the days of my
Dad using Visicalc and all we had was 13 sectors per disk, and even had some
programs I bought from Apple that were on cassette because they sold them
cheaper.  So I loaded them in, and saved them to disk.  All Integer Basic
programs..)  Save the long story, I got my first modem on my birthday of the
same year.  It was a MicroModem II before the AppleCat was even made, which I
quickly bought next when it was made.  Which makes me Class of 83, and i'm 23
years old.  So you can keep your money, I don't want it...  If you think i'm
lying, ask the Sysop of this board and he will tell you I had a board up and
running by xmas with 2 disk drives.  It was a phreak board and he was on it.

And these Rag files i've seen are like you said, nothing to be proud of.  I
find that most of the rag files are made up by 13-15 year olds that have
nothing better to do.  (not saying your amoung them!)  And most of them are
so full of B.S. and you find a Rag file back on the person who wrote it.
They are almost like reading the National Enquirer (sp?), there is so much
that isn't even true.

Boy you can't get away from calling me names can you?  You said I had "half a
brain", and that "I think i'm a stud" which I would say you have turned
around.
I'm a user who very few people know, and I voice my opinion not because it
has anything to do with my ego, but because I feel the need to voice it every
once in awhile.  Just like I have been voting since I was 18!

Then you go on to say something about i'm fucking around?  Your too funny
dude. You think my upload of the text file wasn't directed at sysops?  Look
at the 1st line in the text file.  (ok, after the date)  This major of a bug
isn't anything to fuck around with, or I would of kept my mouth shut and just
let the guys who know about it keep locking up the boards.

I can agree with you on one account.  My message posted on the other board
was written with haha and stuff because I was laughing at the bug, and also
felt a little devious.  It's such a major flaw that was in earlier HST modems
and I was laughing a little inside because I waited long enough to get one
without the major flaw.  If you've read my text file I uploaded, you will not
notice any "haha"s in it.  It is direct and to the point.  Ment to get more
sysops to upgrade their modems and stop the hackers from locking up their
systems.

This argument wasn't started because of my releasing the info about the major
flaw in ealier HST modems, it was because you just don't get along with
certain people that "voice their opinions" when you don't think they have a
right to?
Take at look at the first message you started calling me names from and why.
(It was because I voiced my opinion about the bitching back and forth between
everyone, NOT just you, and it didn't even have your name in it or any hint
of any single person I could of been talking about.  Take a look back in the
messages.)

If you are planning on making a rag file on me, i'll just think your less
mature, and would hope you to include all previous messages from you and I
and my text file about the lockup flaw in older HST modems.  It will just
make me famous. hahahah.  Which wasn't at all my intention at the beginning.
In the text file I was even going to advertise this board, but Sting said no
thanks, maybe I should of asked if you would of liked your board advertised
in it??
Then maybe you wouldn't be calling me names?  haha

Okay, I have calmed down.  Ok Dead Meat, maybe I shouldn't have attacked like
that, but that post did seem quite cruel to me.  You have to admit that there
was possibility for a mistake.  In mistaking it as a "modem geek trying to
get revenge," I guess its your right to voice your opinion.  I took that
opinion personally however, saying things like "look at the bunch of little
kids" and the like.

Lets call it quits, it seems all the locals are joining in on the fight.. I
fear there maybe more locals than LD on this board.  You must agree Macro
Mike is out of place complaining about me in the middle of all this.  It was
his mistake however not yours.

MACRO MIKE seems to be only on this board and on no other.  He must be local. 
So of course he will join in and protect other local users.  I don't take
opinion with a grain of salt.

I'm sorry (directed at Dead Meat), I shouldn't have gotten all bent out of
shape.  Lets call it quits.

PS.  I have been into Apple since 1979.  I enjoyed playing integer Star Trek.
However I didn't own one until 1983, but I was into Apple from the start.

"You notice how this is the only sub-board with any new messages?  I wonder
why?"

You have calmed down?  So you are a little hot headed like Macro Mike said?
You never said what your age is, pardon me for asking.  What is your birthday
and Class of?  I heard you were still in H.S.?

I also apologise for posting the message on the other board, but like Sting
Ray told me, most of the messages longer than 1 page long are read by less
than 40% of the users. So you will see my "more professional attitude" in the
text file that I wrote and all sysops and everyone else is reading, which the
part about everyone else is reading really be helped unless I just wanted to
release it to a select few of sysops which is the opposite that I wanted to
do.

Its over..  This is a transfer board, not a rag line.  I should not have
flown off the handle.   (and Macro Mike still should have not said anything
against me)
