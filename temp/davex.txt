          REDISTRIBUTION PERMITTED
 
          Please distribute Davex widely!  Permission is hereby 
          granted for Davex to be uploaded to electronic bulletin 
          board systems.  It may also included in user group libraries 
          and other collections of Shareware, PROVIDED THAT NO MORE 
          THAN $5.OO IS CHARGED FOR ANY DISK CONTAINING DAVEX, unless 
          special arrangements are made with DAL Systems in advance.
          MODIFIED COPIES OF DAVEX SHALL NOT BE REDISTRIBUTED, and 
          THIS DOCUMENT AND THE ONLINE HELP SHALL BE INCLUDED WHENEVER 
          DAVEX IS REDISTRIBUTED.
 
          Davex can be licensed for inclusion with your own programs; 
          contact DAL Systems for details.
 
          DAVEX ON MULTIPLE COMPUTERS:  You should pay $25 for every 
          copy of Davex that could be in use at the same time, up to a 
          maximum of $200 for all computers owned by one company (or 
          school district).  For example, several people using Davex 
          on one machine (or one person using Davex on several 
          machines in different places) should pay only $25; but two 
          people on two machines should pay $50.
 
 
          COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE WELCOME
 
          DAL Systems will do its best to correct bugs and make 
          updates available.  Davex is a continually evolving package, 
          and you can help shape its future.  (Once you send in $25, 
          you are entitled to use later versions without sending in 
          more money.  However, updates ordered directly from DAL 
          Systems will cost $3.)
 
 
          KICKBACKS TO ENCOURAGE WIDER DISTRIBUTION
          Starting with Davex v1.2
 
          As a registered Davex user, you will receive a $5.OO 
          "kickback" for every new user who registers a copy Davex 
          containing your serial number.
 
          Your serial number is the same as your registration number.  
          To put your serial number on your copy of Davex (if it isn't 
          already there, or if you get an update from a bulletin 
          board), use the "filetype" command to change the auxiliary 
          type of Davex:
 
               filetype %davex sys -x99   [use your serial #, not 99]
 
          Then type "$" to make sure it worked.
 
 
     INTRODUCTION
 
     Davex is a command shell for ProDOS.  ProDOS has no way to accept 
     commands from you directly, so some sort of command interpreter 
     is required.  Davex includes a large number of "housekeeping" 
     commands for managing your disks, directories, and files.
 
     Davex is also a starting place for using other ProDOS programs.  
     When you run another program from Davex (just by typing its 
     name), you will normally be returned automatically to Davex when 
     you Quit the other program.
 
 
     Note:  This document is not a ProDOS tutorial.  Please refer to 
            reference manuals or other introductory ProDOS texts for 
            explanations of ProDOS basics like volume, file, pathname, 
            directory, prefix, and filetype.
 
 
     HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
 
     Any Apple II system that can run ProDOS and display lower case 
     can run Davex.  Davex will be much more convenient for you if you 
     have at least one of the following:  a hard drive, a large RAM 
     drive, two 5.25 inch drives, or at least one 3.5 inch drive.
 
     Davex has been tested extensively on a variety of hardware.  If 
     you find that your hardware is not supported, contact me to see 
     what can be done, or whether an updated version is already 
     available to support your hardware.
 
 
     OPTIONAL HARDWARE
 
     Davex supports the Echo II and SlotBuster II speech synthesizers, 
     using the TEXTALKER or SCAT software that you should already have 
     if you own one of these boards.  To use TEXTALKER, just put a 
     copy of PT.OBJ in the same directory as Davex.  PT.OBJ is part of 
     the Textalker software which has been licensed from Street 
     Electronics Corporation, the designers of the Echo, for 
     distribution with Davex.
 
     For the SlotBuster, ProSCAT must already be installed; Davex will 
     recognize it but will not install it.
 
     (Note to SlotBuster users:  SCAT support is currently flawed.  
     Use "config -4y" to force a 40-column display, or "review" will 
     be garbled.)
 
 
     FILES NEEDED FOR DAVEX
 
     When you install Davex on a hard disk or RAM disk, you should 
     create a subdirectory for Davex.  The name of the subdirectory 
     doesn't matter, but "DAVEX" is the obvious choice.  From within 
     Davex, this directory's name can always be abbreviated as "%".
     Davex itself is a SYS file in the % directory and is usually 
     called DAVEX, although the name does not matter to Davex.  
     %CONFIG is a BIN file; it stores configuration options like 
     printer slot, your scan list, and a file type table.  %HELP is a 
     directory containing help files for individual commands.  If you 
     are short on disk space, you may want to leave %HELP off of your 
     work disk.  If you do, the "help" command will report "directory 
     not found" when you ask for help on a specific command.  (You can 
     also put the help directory on another disk; use the 'config' 
     command to tell Davex the pathname of your help directory.)
 
     No other files are required in the % directory.  Typically there 
     will be external commands (BIN files) and SYS files there.  If 
     you are using any aliases, there will be a TXT file called 
     "aliases" in your % directory (see "help alias").  If you are 
     using the Echo speech synthesizer, there should also be a copy of 
     PT.OBJ in the % directory.
 
 
     RECOMMENDED HARD DRIVE SETUP
 
     Copy the entire "%" directory onto your hard drive.  Then, if you 
     want your system to to boot up directly into Davex, use the 
     "sysalias" command (try "help sysalias") to create a one-block 
     SYS program, with a name ending in ".SYSTEM", in your top-level 
     directory.
 
     For example:
 
          copy % /hard1/davex
          sysalias /hard1/davex/davex /hard1/davex.system
 
     (If there are other ".SYSTEM" files earlier in the directory than 
     davex.system, copy the first one to another disk, delete it, 
     create davex.system using the 'sysalias' command, and finally 
     copy the ".SYSTEM" file back onto the disk.  This way, 
     davex.system will be the first program ProDOS sees when it looks 
     for a program to run.)
 
 
     RAM DISKS
 
     If your RAM disk is backed up by a battery, the instructions for 
     hard disks apply to you.  Just install it once, and you're all 
     set.
 
     To set up a disk that will copy Davex to the RAM disk and execute 
     it there, first you need to understand the "copy" and "exec" 
     commands.  If there is a %autoexec file, it will be executed 
     automatically when you boot Davex.  A typical %autoexec file 
     contains something like this:
 
          copy %=:sys /ram/davex
          copy %=:bin /ram/davex
          copy %aliases /ram/davex
          copy %help /ram/davex/help
          /ram/davex/davex
 
     The first line copies all SYS files from the % directory to the 
     RAM disk, and the second line copies BIN files.  The third line 
     copies the help directory (if you have a small RAM disk, you may 
     not want to copy the help).  The last line simply runs the copy 
     of Davex from the RAM disk.
 
     (Note that it would be simpler to just "copy % /ram/davex".  But 
     this is a problem because the %autoexec file will be in use, 
     causing the copy to fail.)
 
     Once you are running the copy of Davex from the RAM disk, your 
     "%" directory is "/ram/davex".
 
 
     APPLE IIGS USERS
 
     See your dealer for the most recent version of the System Disk.  
     The most recent version (as of February, 1988) is 3.1.  Davex 
     will work with older versions, but keeping up to date is always a 
     good idea for maximum compatibility with new software.
 
     If you have an Apple IIgs and wish to have your system boot into 
     Davex through ProDOS 16 (so you can run S16 and EXE programs  
     without rebooting), the above instructions still apply to you.
 
     You will also need to delete or rename the START file in your 
     SYSTEM directory.  This will force the ProDOS loader to scan your 
     root directory for a startup application instead of running START 
     (which just runs Finder or Launcher).  You may want to type
 
         scan -a /your.boot.disk/system
 
     so that you can run FINDER and LAUNCHER (in the SYSTEM directory) 
     just by typing their names.
 
 
     USING DAVEX
 
     When you enter Davex, you see (in 80 columns if your system 
     supports it):
 
          Davex vX.XX (Serial #xxx)
          Type ? for help, $ for ShareWare notice.
          current_date_and_time
 
          prefix:
 
 
     Your current ProDOS prefix (the directory you're "in"), followed 
     by a colon (:), is your prompt.  Davex expects you to type a 
     command and press RETURN.  (If you press RETURN without typing 
     anything, you just get the current date and time and another 
     prompt.)  [You can use the 'setdate' command to set the date and 
     time if your machine doesn't have a clock.]
 
     Some commands can be executed just by typing their names.  For 
     example:
 
          help
          online
          quit
 
 
     Other commands require additional information (called 
     "parameters") after the command name.  You must type at least one 
     blank space between a command name and the parameters that follow 
     it.  Examples:
 
          delete that.file
          lock /disk3/standard.ltr
 
 
     For some commands, parameters are optional.
 
          help
          help copy
          info
          info /my.disk/my.file
 
 
     You may put more than one command on a line if you separate the 
     commands with semicolons (;).  If an error occurs during one 
     command, the remaining commands will not be executed.
 
 
     WHAT IS A COMMAND?
 
     There are three kinds of commands:
 
     1.  built-in commands
 
          Built-in commands are part of Davex and are always 
          available.  When you type a command, Davex always checks 
          first to see if it's an internal command.  (The '?' or 
          'help' command displays a list of all internal commands.)
 
          If the command you typed is not internal, it looks on your 
          disks, trying to find a file with the same name.  You can 
          tell Davex what directories to look in by using the 'scan' 
          command.  (See "help scan".)
 
     2.  external commands
 
          If the non-internal command is found to be a BIN file, Davex 
          attempts to execute the file's contents as an external 
          command.  These files are usually found in the same 
          directory as Davex, although they can be in any directory on 
          your scan list.
 
          Davex features such as wildcards and shorthand pathnames are 
          available with external commands.
 
          A few external commands are supplied with Davex; an appendix 
          describes how assembly language programmers can write more 
          external commands.
 
     3.  SYS, S16, and EXE programs
 
          If a non-internal command is found to be a SYS or S16 
          program, Davex runs the program.  When you quit the other 
          program, you will be automatically returned to Davex.
 
          [You need the file BRIDGE.S16 in the same directory as Davex 
          to run S16 and EXE programs directly from Davex.  These work 
          only on the Apple IIgs, and you need to boot through 
          ProDOS16 to run them.]
 
 
 
     SHORTHAND FOR PATHNAMES
 
     '%' is shorthand for the name of the directory Davex is in.  A 
     '/' after the '%' is optional.  Examples:
 
        cat %
        cat %help
        cat %/help
        info %davex
 
 
     You can specify a volume by slot and drive number like this:
 
        info .61/prodos   <==>  info /xxx/prodos, where /xxx is the 
                                name of the ProDOS volume in slot 6, 
                                drive 1
 
        prefix .32        <==>  prefix /xxx, where /xxx is the name of 
                                the ProDOS volume in slot 3, drive 2 
                                (usually /RAM)
 
 
 
     WILDCARDS
 
     It is often convenient to execute one command (for example, 
     delete, lock, or copy) on a group of files all at once, rather 
     than on one file at a time.  Davex provides wildcards as a 
     convenient way to work with groups of files.
 
     '=' and '?' are wildcard characters; they "match" any number of 
     characters in a file's name.  You can use wildcards in the last 
     segment of pathnames for many commands.  Only one wildcard per 
     pathname is permitted.
 
     Examples:
 
        lock =        Locks all files in the current directory
 
        delete =.old  Deletes all files ending in ".old" from the 
                      current directory
 
 
     '?' is like '=', but Davex asks you whether or not to operate on 
     each matching file.  Examples:
 
        lock ?        For each file in the current directory, asks you 
                      "lock xxxxx? (Y/N)".  Type Y to lock the file, 
                      or N to skip to the next one.
 
        delete ?.old  For each file in the current directory whose 
                      name ends in ".old", asks whether or not to 
                      delete it.
 
 
     You can restrict a wildcard to match files only if they are of a 
     particular type.  Examples:
 
        pg part?:txt     For each "txt" file in the current directory 
                         beginning with "part", ask whether or not to 
                         "pg" the file ("pg" displays a file one 
                         screenful at a time)
 
 
     ALIASES (ABBREVIATIONS)
 
     Starting with Davex 1.2, there is a primitive "alias" mechanism 
     available.  Before Davex tries to find your commands (in the 
     built-in list, or on disk), it first checks your aliases.  If 
     there is an alias for a command word you typed, Davex replaces 
     the word with what it stands for, and continues process the 
     command line.
 
     Type "alias" to see what aliases are defined.
 
     The aliases are stored in the TXT file %aliases.  See Appendix C 
     for an explanation of the aliases that come on the disk as 
     shipped from DAL Systems.  (Of course, you can change the 
     supplied aliases and add your own--just edit the %aliases file 
     with a text editor.)
 
     Note:  If you use wildcards with an alias, you may be surprised 
     to see Davex refer to the command by its real name.  For example:
 
       /my.disk: kill a?
       delete /my.disk/apple? (y/n)
       delete /my.disk/apricot? (y/n)
 
     (Davex's alias mechanism does not currently support parameters.  
     If it did, the 'move' command would simply have been implemented 
     as the alias "move  copy #1 #2 -d", for example.)
 
 
     PAUSING AND ABORTING
 
     If you press SPACE while the screen is scrolling, it will freeze.  
     Each SPACE press will generally advance the display by one line.  
     Press RETURN to continue scrolling.
 
     Ctrl-C or Apple-period will print "***aborted" and will always 
     return you to the command line prompt.
 
     ESC aborts the current operation, but does not necessarily return 
     you to command level.  For example, if you are executing "pg =", 
     ESC will abort paging the current file, but pg will begin 
     executing on the next file matching the wildcard.
 
 
     CONTROL CHARACTERS AVAILABLE WHILE TYPING A COMMAND LINE
 
     (from "help cmdline")
 
          Ctrl-B = move to beginning of line
          Ctrl-D = delete character at cursor
          Ctrl-E/Ctrl-N = move to end of line
          Ctrl-F = find forward; press ESC to exit
          Ctrl-H (left arrow) = move left
          Ctrl-I = insert (cancelled by arrows or Ctrl-D)
          Ctrl-J (down arrow) = move down on the list of previous 
                   commands
          Ctrl-K (up arrow) = move up on the list of previous commands
          Ctrl-L = toggle Caps-lock on/off for Apple II+
          Ctrl-M = return (accept whole line, even the part after the 
                   cursor)
          Ctrl-O = if the following character is a control character, 
                   inserts it (control characters can't normally be 
                   entered).  If the following character is "K" to "O" 
                   or "k" to "o", a special character is inserted 
                   (useful only on the II+ keyboard):
 
                      K L M N O k l m n o
                      [ \ ] ^ _ { | } ~ DEL
 
          Ctrl-Q = accept portion of line before cursor
          Ctrl-R = re-edit previous input

          Apple-H = Hardcopy of screen (set printer slot with config)
                    (beeps twice if priner is busy) [doesn't work on
                    the Apple II+]
 
 
 
     MUCH MORE INFORMATION ONLINE
 
     This document is intentionally short.  Information on each 
     command and on other topics can be found using the 'help' 
     command.  Type 'help help' (or '??') to get started.
 
     The first line of each help file shows alternative names for the 
     command, if there are any.  Then the command's syntax is given, 
     using square brackets around the parts you can leave out.
 
     DON'T IGNORE THE ONLINE HELP!  Even if a command's purpose and 
     use seem obvious, take a quick look at the help.  Most of the 
     commands have handy options that you won't know about if you skip 
     the help.
 
 
     "DASH" PARAMETERS
 
     Many commands take optional parameters following a "-".  A letter 
     identifying the parameter follows the "-".  In some cases, a 
     value (a number, or string, for example) is expected after the 
     letter, and in other cases nothing more is required.
 
     Examples
 
          cat /xyz -t      The "-t" stands for "tree"; when a DIR 
                           appears in the listing, "-t" tells the 
                           catalog command to indent two spaces and 
                           list the contents of the directory.  No 
                           value is expected after the "-t".
 
          cat /x -fsys     The "-f" stands for "filetype"; a filetype 
                           must be specified after the "f".  (In this 
                           example, files not of type SYS will not 
                           appear in the listing.)

     External commands
 
     These commands are supplied with Davex.  Other external commands can 
     be written by an assembly language programmer.
 
          blist           list a BAS file in ASCII
          brun            run a BIN file ['brun' is actually a small SYS 
                              file, not an external command]
          chkmod          compare modification dates on pairs of files
          conp            set IIgs control panel options

                              name, type, auxiliary type, need-backup)
          find            search files for lines containing a given string
          gsbuff          set Apple IIgs printer/modem buffer sizes
          hdr             print lines from the beginning of a file
          init            initialize (format) any ProDOS block device (or 
                              just write Boot blocks to a volume)
          iw2             set up print options for ImageWriter II
          mx80            set up print options for Epson MX80
          pset            set up print options for NEC8023 / ProWriter / 
                              Imagewriter
          setdate         sets date and time (only if no clock available)
          setstart        examine or set the startup path of a SYS 
                              application
          sysalias        create an alias for a SYS file
          what            determine what a file is (this can be really 
                              handy!)
 
 
     TRICKINESS
 
          If a non-internal command is found to be of type DIR 
     (subdirectory or volume), Davex simply sets your prefix to that 
     directory.  This is similar to using the 'prefix' command, except that 
     the scan list is used.
 
          After an optional parameter that accepts no parameter value, 
     additional parameters can follow without another "-".  For example,
 
                         copy this that -fb
     is the same as
                         copy this that -f -b
 
     and
                         cat .61 -ta
     is the same as
                         cat .61 -t -a
 
     HOWEVER,
                         cat .61 -at
     is NOT the same as
                         cat .61 -a -t
 
     because the "-a" parameter takes a string value (in "cat .61 -ta" the 
     string value following "-a" consists of 0 characters).
 
 
          Some SYS files can take a pathname parameter; BASIC.SYSTEM, for 
     example, will run whatever BAS file you specify as its parameter 
     (actually it does a '-' command, so you can also BRUN a BIN file, EXEC 
     a TXT file, or launch a SYS file).  If BASIC.SYSTEM is available in 
     one of your scan directories, you can type
 
          BASIC.SYSTEM MYPROGRAM
 
     to run MYPROGRAM under BASIC.SYSTEM.  To Davex, the parameter 
     following the name of a SYS file is a STRING, not a pathname.  This 
     means you can't use the "%" or ".xx" shorthand notations in the 
     parameter.
 
     (Note that BASIC.SYSTEM does not always preserve your prefix.  If your 
     prefix refers to a subdirectory, BASIC.SYSTEM will preserve it; 
     otherwise it sets the prefix to be EMPTY and behaves like DOS 3.3--it 
     goes by slot and drive numbers and defaults to the slot/drive that 
     BASIC.SYSTEM was loaded from.)
 
     The 'info' command will tell you whether a particular SYS file has a 
     startup buffer.
 
 
                      Appendix A:  Hardware Compatibility
 
 
     Davex has been tested with the following Apple IIs:  Apple II+ 
     (SmarTerm 80-column, shift-key mod), Apple //e (original and 
     enhanced), Apple //c (original and UniDisk 3.5 ROM), and Apple IIgs.
 
 
     IIgs Support
 
     Davex is compatible with the IIgs but does not behave much differently 
     than on an eariler Apple.  Since Davex does not disable interrupts, 
     you can use Classic Desk Accessories (including the Control Panel) 
     with no problem.  If you launch Davex from a ProDOS 16 controlling 
     program (like the Launcher, APW, or ECP16), you will be returned to it 
     when you quit Davex.  You can launch a ProDOS 16 application (a file 
     with type S16) by typing its name (assuming the directory it's in is 
     in your scan list), and you be automatically returned to Davex when 
     you quit.  (The file %BRIDGE.S16 is a tiny ProDOS 16 application that 
     makes this possible.)
 
 
                     Appendix B:  AppleWorks Compatibility
 
 
     The pg and type commands recognize AWP files.  In future Davex 
     versions, 'spool' and 'exec' will probably recognize AWP files. 
 
     The 'cat' command displays AWP, ADB, and ASP filenames using the 
     capitalization you used when naming the files in AppleWorks.  (This 
     information is stored in the files' auxiliary type fields.)
 
 
                          Appendix C: Standard Aliases
 
     This appendix lists and explains the aliases provided in the 
     "%aliases" file.  You can use a text editor to remove or change these 
     aliases, and you can add your own.  The maximum size of the %aliases 
     file is currently 512 bytes (one block); if your %aliases file is 
     longer than 512 bytes, Davex simply ignores the excess.
 
     q bye
     quit q
       Explanation:  "q" and "quit" stand for "bye" (leave Davex).
 
     > como
     < exec
       Explanation: ">" stands for "como" (send output to a file or slot) 
       and "<" stands for "exec" (get command input from a file)
 
     cd prefix
     pfx cd
     down cd
       Explanation: "cd" (change directory), "pfx", and "down" all stand 
       for "prefix".  "down" is appropriate because the 'prefix' command 
       takes you down to a subdirectory if you use a partial pathname 
       (example: "down mydir" or "down firstdir/xyz/abc").
 
     \ up
       Explanation: "\" stands for "up", which takes you to the directory 
       above.
 
     over up;down
       Explanation:  "over" stands for "up" followed by the directory name 
       you type.  Example:  If your prefix is "/mydisk/dir1" and you type 
       "over dir2", your prefix will then be "/mydisk/dir2".  Wildcards are 
       allowed, because they are not expanded until the "prefix" ("down") 
       command is executed.
 
     or %;top
     origin or
       Explanation:  "origin" or "or" takes you to the top level directory 
       of the disk Davex is running from.  "%" takes you to the Davex 
       directory, and then "top" takes you to the top level directory.
 
     o online
       Explanation:  "o" stands for "online", which shows a list of all 
       disks in your drives.
 
     home cls
       Explanation:  "home" stands for "cls", which clears the screen (or 
       starts a new page on the printer).
 
     slist type
     tlist type
       Explanation:  "slist" and "tlist" stand for "type", which displays 
       the contents of a file.
 
     more pg
       Explanation:  "more" stands for "pg", which displays the contents of 
       a file one screenful at a time.
 
     mv rename
     cname mv
       Explanation:  "mv" (move) and "cname" (change name) stand for 
       "rename", which changes the name of a file, directory, or volume.
 
     ctype filetype
       Explanation:  "ctype" stands for "filetype", which is used for 
       changing the type or auxiliary type of a file.
 
     mkdir create
     md create
       Explanation:  "mkdir" and "md" (make directory) stand for "create", 
       which can be used to create subdirectories (as well as other files).
 
     rm delete
     del rm
     kill rm
       Explanation:  "rm", "del", and "kill" all stand for "delete", which 
       erases files and directories.
 
     catalog cat
     dir cat
     ld cat
     ls cat
       Explanation:  "catalog", "dir" (directory), "ld" (list directory), 
       and "ls" (list) all stand for "cat", which displays catalog 
       listings.
 
     cp copy
       Explanation:  "cp" stands for "copy", which copies files and 
       directories.
 
     e echo
       Explanation:  "e" stands for "echo", which prints the strings you 
       feed it (useful from "exec" files).
 
     ej eject
       Explanation:  "ej" stands for "eject", which ejects 3.5" disks from 
       their drives.
 
     print > &;
       Explanation:  "print" stands for redirecting output to the printer, 
       and the semicolon between commands is included in the alias, so you 
       don't need to type one when you use it.  Example:  "print help 
       rename", or "print cat -t", but NOT "print filename".
 
     page > &;cls
       Explanation:  "page" does a clear-screen after sending output to the 
       printer.  Result:  the printer advances to the top of the page.
