When I bought my Apple (early 1980), Odyssey and Zork I were the
best games available. But you couldn't play Odyssey without
Integer BASIC or 64K, so I never did until Softdisk put it on a
disk in Applesoft ($10 - $5 coupon if you are a Softdisk
contributor).
 
The game is still fun, but just too hard. I needed help. Like my
drill sergeant said, "If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying."
To cheat I had to defeat Softdisk's wimpy protection.
 
    Anyway, if you have Demuffin Plus:
 
    1. Initialize a disk.
    2. Write a sector starting with 01 AD E8 C0 4C 59 FF or
       something to stop the drive & halt bootup to T0 S0.
    3. Boot Odyssey.
    4. Put in the noboot disk & press reset. It will load T0S0 to
       $800-8FF, but won't overwrite the protected DOS.
    5. *2000<9000.BFFFM     Move DOS out of way
    6. Boot normal disk.
    7. ]BLOAD DEMUFFIN PLUS,A$803
    8. ]CALL-151
    9. *9000<2000.4FFFM     Move protected DOS back
    10. *803G
    11. Copy all files to blank disk with wildcard =.
 
To cheat, interrupt the program at any point with a ctrl-C,
change variables (ie FM = men, BG & BI & Bsomething else control
inventory)
