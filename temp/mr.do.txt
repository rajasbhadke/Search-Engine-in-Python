     * STRATEGY * 

       Your goal is to eat as many cherries and center treats as you
       can while defending yourself against the monsters with your
       super power-ball and the giant falling apples.          

       There are four types of monsters to look out for: regular monsters,
       boss monsters (the EXTRA letter monsters), henchmen, and diggers.
       Of all monsters, only the diggers can dig tunnels. The regular
       monsters will occasionally change into diggers, so beware !!!

       The boss monsters have a letter on them ( watch the word EXTRA at the
       top of the screen.) and appear whenever you eat the center treat, and
       at every 5,000 points and multiples thereof. (A boss monster will only
       appear if he is covering a letter not already released and destroyed.)
       When the boss monster appears after you eat the center treat, the boss
       monsters henchmen accompany him. The henchmen cannot always be destroyed
       by falling apples. If you destroy a boss monster first, before destroy-
       ing his henchmen, all his henchmen will turn into apples. If you can
       destroy all the EXTRA boss monsters, you will be rewarded with an extra
       Mr. Do. And look for the lucky diamond that appears in some fallen,
       broken apples. Grab it for a giant bonus!
