This is the detailed listing (includes hardware, sysop, update information,
etc.) of full time, local (Portland, Oregon) bulletin board and public access
computer systems. If you notice any errors or if you know of a new BBS,
please leave a message for Lisa Gronke on DawgGone Disgusted. Even better,
leave it in the ANNOUNCE Echo on any Net 105 BBS that carries it. I can also
be reached via FidoNet Mail to Lisa Gronke at 1:105/6 or via uucp mail to
l...@m2xenix.psg.com or gro...@techbook.com.

Part-time BBS (those without a dedicated phone line) have been moved to a
separate list.

All BBS on this list are local calls from central Portland and can be
reached using PC Pursuit (ORPOR outdial) . This BBS list is available on
many Portland BBS ... here are a few selected locations where I know prior
validation is not required.

New editions of this list are published monthly. The following people have
been of invaluable help in maintaining this list: Randy Bush, Katherine
Stewart, Ken Zwaschka, Dave Schooler & Raymond Keith.

This listing is dedicated to Rick Bensene, former sysop of Bit Bucket
BBS, who shaped my ideas of what a BBS should be, and who created this
list, established its standard of quality, and maintained it from
1982 to 1986 ... and to Randy Bush, who introduced me to FidoNet and
offered the facilities of his BBS when I took my BBS offline.
