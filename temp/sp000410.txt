              IGNALINA NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
                         
by Linas Vainius and Saulius Pikshris
continuation from NN 9-15
     
     Legislation.
     NPP works without Nuclear Energy Law  in  Lithuania.  The
mechanism of  compensation for neighbouring inhabitants in the
case of accidents is indefinite,
     Besides the civil defense is wicked organized, ability to
liquidate the consequences of greater accidents in NPP cause a
lot of reasonable critics.
     At the end of 1993 Lithuanian "Seimas" ratified  Vienna's
Convention concerning  the  civil  responsibility  for nuclear
damage. The compensation for the States,  which  suffered  the
harm because  of  an  accident  in  unbearable  task  agonised
Lithuanian economy.
     But without   such  a  step  it  was  inpossible  to  get
international financial support for NPP safety strengthening.
     The Nuclear Energy Law is being prepared by EM. As NPP is
subordinate to EM,  the Law which is being prepared by the  EM
may have one-sided interest and influence on it,  run over the
NPP interest.  The  society  should  be  acquainted  with  the
law project and independent experts should be involved as well.
     Social problems.
     A lot  of  social problems are connected with the closing
of Ignalina NPP.  It is the further fate of some thousand  NPP
workers and  also  the  further  occupation  of  some thousand
Visaginas inhabitants.  Visaginas is the living place  of  NPP
workers. Thereis  one  more lobby group (foreign companies and
other groups of experts),  which are discussing quite  seldom,
but it  has an important role for NPP activity.  These foreign
companies have the contracts with NPP to  reconstruct  and  to
develop safety system and other equipment. The speeches of the
representatives of such companies  are  often  optimistic  and
reassuring the  society.  Besides frequent experts commissions
leave only tones of new papers and  vague  reasoning  the  NPP
perspectives. The  greatest  part of financial support for NPP
safety strengthening is spent  for  the  payment  of  expert's
journeys, hotels  and  etc.  The  NPP  workers sometimes doubt
about the expediency of such examination-trips and other  ways
spending of means.
