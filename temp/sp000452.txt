VICTORY!  Since 1992,  NGOs have been  fighting  with  a  join
project of Italian (EMIT,  Acqua) and Polish companies for the
construction of 56,000 tpa  MSW  incinerator  in  Warsaw.  The
arguments  they  have  used  against the project include:  the
Warsaw  District  Council  decided  on  the  location  of  the
incinerator   before   submitting   an   environmental  impact
assessment  (EIA)  to  the  Warsaw  Provincial   Environmental
Department;  the  location  of the incinerator is illegal,  as
according to Polish law it is forbidden to construct in a city
any  facility that would emit over 20,000 tpa of gases;  there
is lack of complete information about the  emission  of  heavy
metals from the proposed incinerator.  In sum, the project has
violated 9 national and local regulations.  Three NGOs:  Waste
Prevention Association, Green Federation and Social Ecological
Institute have submitted  the  case  to  the  Warsaw  District
Council  Court.  Recently,  on  September  16,  the  Court has
recognised the arguments of NGOs and has decided that  process
of location of the incinerator,  and the EIA must be repeated,
must start from the  very  beginning.  This  precedential  and
important  decision  will be another tool for the NGOs to stop
the project ultimately,  unless it collapses of financial  and
administrative reasons. <WPA>

CIBA-GEIGY. In  July,  Ciba-Geigy has opened the largest store
of pesticides in Poland.  The store  "Ciba  Magazyn  Agro"  is
located in Warsaw,  has 30,000 cubic meters cubature,  has two
railways,  is fully computerised,  and protected  (?)  against
fire  and  outflow.  It  is expected that over 4,000 tonnes of
pesticides will be distributed  annually  from  the  store  to
different   countries   of  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  and
Commonwealth  of  Independent  States.  Aleksander  Wyrwinski,
member  of  the  company's board,  said that "Ciba- Geigy will
extend the store.  It will be two times larger in the future".
<Rzeczpospolita, 1.07.1994>

DRAWERS MADE  OF  PVC.  A  French  company  RHOVYL,  based  in
Tronville-en- Barrois,  wants to sell  in  Poland  clothes  --
undies  and  sport  dresses -- made of PVC fibre.  Alan Regad,
president of RHOVYL,  said that  the  company  has  come  into
contact  with  a  few  Polish  firms  which have just prepared
examples of fashions to be produced  for  the  Polish  market.
POLO   (Kalisz)   wants  to  produce  underclothes,  also  for
children;  ZAKLADY WOLA (Zdunska Wola) would  produce  tights,
and  WELDORO  (Bielsko-Biala) "various assortment of clothes".
RHOVYL hasn't applied for the certificate  (attest)  to  State
Institute  of  Hygiene (PZH),  which is a legal requirement in
case where a new product is introduced on the market,  and may
have the impact on the human health. RHOVYL has been producing
PVC fibre since 50's.  In 50-60's it produced 13,000 tonnes of
fibre,  but at the present production dropped to 4,000 tonnes,
although the capacity is 9,000 tonnes. At the past it employed
2340  workers,  now  100  -- "because of the automation of the
production process". 25 per cent of the production is exported
to  other countries of Western Europe and Japan.  Annual trade
turnover is estimated at 120 million FF.  Untill 1992,  RHOVYL
belonged to RHONE PULENC. <Rzeczpospolita, 7.09.1994>

RECYCLING OF  PET BOTTLES.  Despite of proposed ban for import
and  the  construction  of  new  production   lines   of   PET
(polyethylene terephthalate) packaging, still appear offers of
set up the system of its collecting and recycling.  The  first
offer  appeared  a few months ago.  The National Found for the
Environmental Protection wanted to establish  a  join  venture
with  Wellman  International  Ltd,  one of the world's largest
plastic recycling company.  They wanted to  construct  in  the
central  Poland  a  plant  for  melting  of  5,000  tpa of PET
bottles. There the bottles would be cleaned, melted into bales
and  then  transported to the Netherlands or to Ireland to the
Wellman plant for recycling into fibre. Probably, this project
has fallen because of the problem to organise a central system
of collecting PET packaging and to gather enough material  for
reprocessing.  The  second  offer comes from a Polish company.
Chemical Plant  "Blachownia"  in  Kedzierzyn  Kozle  announced
recently  that  it has developed a method of recycling the PET
bottles.  In order to make the venture profitable "Blachownia"
needs  20,000 tonnes of PET annually.  This amount matches the
yearly  production  of   all   Polish   enterprises...
