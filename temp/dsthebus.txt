well...the freindly sprint people came to my house.  they didn't take anything
or anything.  They just stayed for about 2 hours and interogated the hell out
of me...about everything.  They even wanted to know about stuff like hacking
their computers or something.    I got caught using 18008778000  which I was
not aware was SPRINT in the first place....i was using  a backdoor on it.
anyway....i have a bill for $758 which just destroyed my applefest in san
fran....but such is life....

later
