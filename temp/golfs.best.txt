How to Play:
 
   You are standing at the tee on Hole #3 at the Pinehurst No.2 course.  It's
a par four, 316/335 yards in length, surrounded by bunkers.  You must decide
how to play the hole-just like on the golf course.
 
1. What club should you use?
2. How hard should you swing?
3. How should you hit the ball-straight, with a slice or hook?
4. In what direction should you hit?
 
   Let's look at the hole and "practice" a little before we hit.
   Press the 2 key.  You will see a legend showing the colors, and the patterns
they represent.  You will notice that the colors correspond to bunkers, fair-
ways, greens, trees, rough, etc.  Now hit any key and go back to the tee.  You
can see the bunkers, trees, etc. on this hole.
   Now let's think about club selection.  At the end of this documentation you
will see a table showing the clubs, force of swing, average roll, an degree of
loft.  This table helps you determine which club to select and the force with
which to hit-full swing, half swing, quarter swing.
   Your golf bag contains five woods, nine irons, a sand wedge, a pitching
wedge, and a putter.  The woods are numbered 1W-5W; the irons are numbered
1I-9I.  The wedges are PW, SW, and the putter is PT.
 
Club Selection:
 
  Look at the bottom left portion of the screen.  You will see six figures:
a golfer, a golf club, a vertical line, a clock, speaker, and letters with #s.
Let's talk about the club first.
   Before you can hit, you must select a club.  Press the letter 'C' and you will see this prompt:
   Which club:0A
   Type the two letter name of the club you want to hit with.  For illustration, type 2W.  You will return to the hole.  Look at the area where
the club was and you should now see 2W.  You have selected the two wood.  If
you change your mind, type 'C' again and select a different club.  You can
select a club and return it to your "bag" as many times as you need, until
you're satisfied with the selection.
 
Force of Stroke:
 
   How hard should you hit the ball?  Full swing, half swing, quarter swing?
Anytime you select a wood or iron, you must decide on the swing; this is the
force or the degree of swing.
   Press the letter 'F' and you'll see the prompt:
   Full, Half, Quarter:
   Type 'Q' and return to the hole.  Look at the golfer now; he's taking a
quarter swing! (wow)  Press 'F' again and respond by typing 'F'.  Now he's
taking a full swing.  You can adjust the swing to fit the situation.  For
illustration, let's use a full swing.
   NOTE: The force of stroke is a little different for the wedges and putter.
         We'll discuss this in a moment.
 
Style-Hook, Slice, or Straight
 
   Does this hole require a hook or a slice?  Do you need to hit it straight?
The vertical line figure means that you are set to hit a straight shot.  Press
the letter 'S' and see the prompt.  Hook, Slice, or Normal: Respond to the
prompt by typing an 'H' for Hook.  When the hole displays, look at the vertical
line-it's bending to the left.  If you typed S, it would bend to the right.
Press S again and select a normal style (N).  Hooks and slices are highly
valuable.  In general, the amount of curve is the greatest off the tee.
 
Direction:
 
   So far, you have selected a club, a swing, and a style.  The little
clock figure tells you that you need to pick a direction.   Line up your
shot by imagining the ball following a line that points in the direction of
the hour hand.
   Let's try this so you can see.  Press the letter 'D' to see the prompt.
   Enter direction: 00:00
   Type in 10:30 and try to imagine where the hour hand is pointing when
the time is 10:30.  Watch while the game plots your direction with a line.
Did the line intersect with the hole?  Play around with the direction and
line the shot up with the hole.
   NOTE: If you do not select a direction, the ball will go in the general
direction of the pin.
 
Stroke the Ball:
 
   Are you ready?  Have you selected a club, swing, style and direction?
Good!  Hit the ball by pressing 1.  Watch the lower portion of the screen as
the computer plots the flight of the ball.  Hope you didn't hit a tree!
 
Quiet Please:
 
   Suppose you'd like to play at work (during lunch, of course!) and don't
want to disturb anyone-especially, your boss.  Press 3 anytime to silence
any any beeps, clicks, or music and your "speaker figure" will turn off its
sound.
 
A Reminder:
 
   The current hole you are playing and its par are displayed for your
convenience.
 
Other Features and Shots:
 
  See how easy it is?  How did you do?  Sometimes the ball may hook or slice
even though you hit it straight.  Don't get too frustrated-it happens to the
pros, too.
   Let's play with some of the other features before you hit your next shot.
   Range-
   The range feature plots a line with a selected number of feet or yards,
from the ball to the pin.  Press the 'R' key to see the prompt.
   Enter range in units?  For illustration, type 100 and press RETURN.  You
will see a line that represents a range of 100 yards (or feet) from your ball
toward the pin.  The computer determines if the unit should be yards or feet,
depending upon how close you are to the pin.  The "range" feature should be
used to help you determine when to "play short," or "go for it."
 
   Correction:
 
   Press the ESC key, if you see you are entering an invalid response, and you
will return to the main prompt screen.
 
   The Second Shot:
 
   Ready to hit the second shot?  If you are within 70 yards of the pin, you
will notice that you are seeing a different view of the hole.  GOLF's BEST<tm>
shows three different views of the hole: one from the tee, one from the fair-
way, and one from the green.
   You may need to select a wedge for your next shot.  The wedges (and putter)
do not require you to select a degree of swing; instead you select force by
specifying a distance, in feet.
   Lets try a pitching wedge.  Press the 'C' key, and select PW (pitching wedge).  Now press 'F' key to select force.  You will see the prompt:
   Enter Force:
   Type the distance you with to hit the ball, in feet.  Remember: You may
need to hit your second shot.  Select a club, force, style and direction.
Press 1 and watch the ball go. (If you ended up in the woods, you may want
to select a hunting wedge. HA!)
   NOTE: You do not select a style for putts or wedge shots.
 
The Putt:
 
   When you are on the geen and ready to putt, press the letter 'C' to select
a club and type 'PT'.  Press the letter 'F' to select the force and enter the
force in feet.  The computer shows you the slope of the green by displaying
an arrow that points to the LOWEST area on the green.  Be sue to take this into
consideration.
   For example, if you are 20 feet from the pin and the slope is steep, you
may need to hit with a force of 30 feet to "play the break."
   Now select a direction and press 1.  Did it go in?  No?  Try agan!
 
The 19th Hole:
 
   That's all there is to it!  Just select a club, force, style, and direction
to hit the ball.  It's just like being on the course!
   In all cases, the normal rules of golf apply.  The person who is the
farthest from the pin hits first; all out-of-bounds and water shos will cost
you a stroke; and no Mulligans are allowed!  The computer keeps score for
you.  Press 4 to see the scorecard.  How are you doing?
   Sometimes the real world interferes with the important things we like to do-
like play golf.  From time-to-time, we must return to work and family duties.
The player who is "up" can quit at any time: just press the letter 'Q' and
respond to the prompt by typing the ltter 'Y' (yes).  Press RETURN and you're
off the couse and back at work.
   No need to take a shower, turn in your cart, or carry your clubs to your
car-they are safely stored away until the next game!
   Have a good round on Pinehurst No. 2!
 
Course Rules:
 
1. Player farthest from the pin hits first.
2. One stroke penlty if ball goes in the water.
3. One stroke penalty if ball goes out of bounds & loss of distance.
4. Replace all divots!
5. Courtesy demands "quiet" when a player is ready to hit.
