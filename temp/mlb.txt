 After booting up your Micro League Baseball diskette,you will be given 2
choices. 1) To start a game  or  2)Watch a demo game. A demo game simply shows
what the game looks like,but doesn't give any docs.
 Once you've started the game,it will give you a screen giving you some idea
of what you're supposed to do.Just ignore this,since it may confuse you more,
and these docs cover what it tells you to do.What you should be concerned
about is what it is asking you at the bottom.It requests whether or not you
want a designated hitter.A designated hitter (DH) takes the place of the 
pitcher when your team is at bat,because most pitchers cannot hit for the life
of them.DH's do not play when your team is out in the field.If you do not 
choose to have a DH,your pitcher will be placed on the batting line-up.
 Once you've answered it,you will be given a list of different teams,
and are asked to choose a visiting team.Do this by simply pressing the letter
corresponding to the team you want.After doing so,it will ask whether you want
to control it or have the computer control the team.If you're playing alone,
I suggest you pick the computer to control one of the teams,unless you want to
play a highly boring game.
 Once you've chosen the visiting team,you must do the same thing for the home
team.Once you've finished that,you will be given 4 different menus.The 1st one
gives you the starting pitcher and the pitching bench for the visiting team.
The menu at the bottom should be fairly easy to understand,and you can switch
your pitchers around the way you want to.
 The 2nd menu is the batting and position line-up for the visiting team.Again,
you can follow the menu at the bottom to manipulate the line-up.One point
though...  most players can play 2 positions.This is designated by a position/
position next to the name (ie:SS/3B for short stop and 3rd base.) if you change
a position from one player to another,and the new player you are putting into
the position has can play one of those positions,it will accept the change.You
cannot however,place a player who can only play,say 1st base into left field.
 The 3rd and 4th menus are the same exact thing for the home team.
 After you're done,the field will come on the screen,and the home team will
walk and the scoreboards will appear.Once the opening themes are done,you
will be given a certain prompt depending on which team you are playing and how
many players there are.
 If there is only 1 player,you will be given either the OFFENSE or DEFENSE
prompt,depending on if you're playing the home or away team.If you are given
the DEFENSE prompt (which means you're team is out on the field) you can do the
following...

                                DEFENSE MENU
Key                                       Action
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1                              Pitcher throws a fastball
 2                              Pitcher throws a curve
 3                              Pitcher throws a slider
 4                              Pitcher throws a change-up
 5                              Pitcher throws a pitch out
 6                              Brings 1st and 3rd base in and asks for pitch
 7                              Brings 1st,2nd,3rd & SS in and asks for pitch
 8                              Intentional Walk
 9                              Edit your batting/position line-up
 0                              Change your pitcher
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Keys # 1,2,3,4 I don't think I need to explain.They are the 4 different types
of pitches you can throw.
 Key #5 throws a pitch out if you think someone on base is going to steal.If
you throw a pitchout,and he does try to steal,it gives you a better chance to
pick him off.
 Key #6 brings your 1st and 3rd basemen in.This gives you a better chance to
field a bunt or get a double play if the batter hits a ground ball.After you
hit 6,it will ask you what type of pitch you want to throw (either 1,2,3,4)
 Key #7 does pretty much the same thing,except your 1st,2nd,3rd,and short
stop all come in.
 Key #8 throws an intentional walk.This is useful if a powerful hitter is up
and you want to avoid the chance that he might hit a home run or a good hit.
 Key #9 allows you to change pitchers.Your pitcher might get tired sometime
in the game,and you may want to put in a relief pitcher.

 If you are given the OFFENSE prompt (meaning your team is up at bat) you can
do the following...

                             OFFENSE MENU
Key                                       Action        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1                                        Try to hit a power shot
 2                                        Try to hit a slow mover/blooper
 3                                        Runners on base attempt to steal
 4                                        Hit & run play
 5                                        Bunt with man on
 6                                        Normal bunt
 7                                        Change your pitcher
 8                                        Substitute the batter or a runner
 9                                        Change your line-up
 0                                        Normal hit attempt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Key #1 can only be used when you have 1 or more men on base.This tells the
batter to go for a long hard hit (Namely,a home run).It doesn't always work
though.
 Key #2 can only be used when you have 1 or more men on base.This tells the
batter to go for a short weak hit which may fall between the infield and out-
field,or to hit one slow enough so he can beat out the throw to first.Again,
it doesn't always work.
 Key #3 tells all players on base to attempt to steal.
 Key #4 starts a hit & run play.As soon as the pitcher throws the pitch,the
runners run as though they were going to steal.However,the batter attempts to
hit the ball no matter where it is.This way,the runners may get more bases
than they would have normally.Note:If the batter fails to hit the ball,the
game considers the play as though the runners were attempting to steal.
 Key #5 can only be used when you have 1 or more men on base.This is used for
a sacrifice bunt.Using this will usually result in the batter getting out,but
will move your runners over one base safely.
 Key #6 tells the batter to bunt also.However,this bunt gives your batter
a better chance of reaching first.However,if you have any runners on,they may
get out depending on where the ball was hit.
 Key #7 allows you to change your pitcher
 Key #8 allows you to put in a pinch hitter or runner
 Key #9 allows you to change your line-up
 Key #0 is your normal hit key.Use this key for a normal hit (Which can be
pretty much anything)

 Those are pretty much all the docs.There are a few other notes however.

 The computer picks a random ball-strike count.Which means..you don't get 4
balls and 3 strikes like in real baseball.The game only allows one ball or
one strike.
 Before you change sides (after 3 outs) and if you've made a batting or
pitching change,the system will ask you to hit a key.I don't know why it
does this..but sometimes it will put you back in either the line-up or pitching
menu.If you've already made the change,simply hit escape.
 There may be a bug in your copy.If you allow a designated hitter,the game
may royally screw up your lineup (Like..you may have the same guy playing 5
different positions.) If this happens,you cannot have a designated hitter.Re-
boot your game and answer N to the question "Do you want a designated Hitter".
 When you decide to change your pitcher,it's alright to simply take a pitcher
off your bench,but he won't be warmed up and he may be hit off of the first
couple innings he's in.It's better to put your relief pitcher in the bull pen
for a few innings before brining him in,which warms him up a lot.

                            ** Special Keys **

Hitting an "M" at the OFFENSE or DEFENSE prompts will turn the organ on & off
Hitting an "R" at the OFFENSE or DEFENSE prompts will toggle on & off whether
the players run on and off the field when changing sides.When you turn the
"Run to Dug out" off,the players change sides instantly,which decreases game
time (You don't have to sit and watch them run back and forth...)

                      Anyway..thats pretty much it.Have fun
                                       and
                             P L A Y          B A L L !
