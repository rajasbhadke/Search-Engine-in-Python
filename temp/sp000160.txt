Guacamole

This is a great recipe. Key is getting good avocados. They are
natures second butter. It is rather like a sour cream dip but
vegan. I have it with big bits of wholemeal bread.

2 large avocados
2 large tomatoes, peeled
2 tablespoon grated or very finely chopped onion
1 tablespoon fresh coriander leaves
clove of garlic
fresh chilies finely chopped, amount to taste (quite a few needed
because avocado softens heat)
1 tablespoon paprika
pepper, salt

To peel tomatoes score then place in near boiling water for a
minute.
Mix all together, serve chilled.
To store put in tall glass with layer of vegetable oil to protect
from air. Store in fridge. When needed pour off, & mix in bit
left.

Hummus

6 oz chick peas
3 cloves crushed garlic
2 teaspoons tahini
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chick pea stock (or water)
pepper, salt
paprika

Soak chick peas overnight, drain. Cover in fresh water, simmer
for 1 & 1/2 hours. Drain liquid. Liquidise with the rest. Garnish
with the paprika. Serve in hot pitta bread. Vary amounts to
taste.
