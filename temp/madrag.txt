maybe he did do it in less than 30 minutes.  He still didn't do the first one
in less than an hour I would bet.  I never bagged on his abilities.  I simply
stated a fact that cracking takes time for the little things like setting
things up and booting programs and other shit.  10 minutes just ain't so if
its the first time you have cracked a certain protection.....which I found
out later was not the case.

even has a tape of you crying because we kicked you out.  The fact is
apple...you suck.  you p0ze and you are a crumpled peice of shit that needs
to be trampled on.  why don't you go suck crashers dick and make up.  You
guys seem to have a common enemy....USAlliance.....heh heh.  get a life

you are ssssssoooooooooooooooooooo  full of shit it hurts asswipe.

you know who is on here?  of course you mean necromancer...the awesome
cracker and your best freind....thats what you keep saying anyway.  maybe he
is...heh heh.... but show me up as a p0zer?  hmmm...don't think so.  I know
my stuff and I know it pretty well.  Dosn't matter how good necromancer is.
That dosn't make me know any less.

Hick???....heh heh....oh my god....that is a steve original if I {ver heard
one.  i live in a city of about 200,000 people including all the surounding
cities...kinda like NY and all the surrounding area is called NY....whatever.
I live in the suburbs and go to{a big high school.

you have a tape of me crying over multiscribe?  how interesting.  that must
be kinda strange because i of course didn't. on the other hand you hand you
of course did.  and their IS a tape of it.  very proveable.  you know about
as much machine language as your p0ze headed bastard father the crasher.
which is NONE.  you once even told doug that you were the ULTIMATE cracker
and that you could crack any and everything that ever was or wi*rZll be...
you know C? that is so fucking funn{/disgusting that it dosn't deserve a
reply.

steve...the final fact is that you are a degrading form{of life that dosn't
belong on ths planet.  you are a loser and always will be.  nothing will ever
change that.....god you are a l0zer.

security guards carry me off???? can't defend yourself punny asswipe?  i am
not that stupid.  we will meet and their will be nobody to take up for you.
you will answer for your words...heh heh...i can GUARENTEEu! that.

i am not the mpg blue adept and never claimed to be.  i have been in modeming
for around 3 years..{ and never once have i met somebody who is as pathetic
as you and crasher

There is no tape of me, sorry dude. Even if that conversation happened, Adam
returned his answering machine, etc. so there definitely is no tape to listen
to.

I do know some ML, asswipe, which is probably more than you know. I don't
proclaim to be an expert nor have the desire to be one or I wouldn't have
continued learning ML. I do know alot of C...would you like me to prove it?

And I know about these "Oh, I'm going to beat you up at ____" things, they
never happen. The two people just stand there and try to avoid one seeing the
other. Believe me, you can promise all you want, it won't happen, you know it

haven't been modeming 3 years, more like 3 months. Then you have to stoop to
namecalling..haha.

I don't really care what they say. I'm definitely not the type to want to get

So simply, put, I don't care but they do, so I play this "GAME" of theirs to
amuse them. I take some of SA's/your views on modeming, its just a bunch of
people you'll never meet anyway, and modeming isn't something that can help
you later in life, its a waste, occasionally you meet a few cool people along

This rag war is quite amusing.

Here we have 3 or 4 nobodies in the
world of piracy trying to prove who's
more nobody than the other nobodies.
That's like trying to prove who's had
AIDS the least amount of time or
something.  Geez.  Who gives a flying
fuck?

Although you all, with the exception of
Blue Adept, may be cool people, you
have all done absolutely nothing to
earn a good reputation in the pirate
world.  Right now it's just a good
laugh for the rest of us.  Keep it up.

Mr. Blue Adept, you did indeed say you
were the original.  I remember posts on
The Curse about it, and I have your RSA
new user application where you claimed
to be in MPG.  I don't have it handy,
but I'm sure I can dig it up.  You
bullshitted your way around, telling
everybody that you were just getting
back into it and you had to learn
ProDOS.  Don't deny it.  I have a very
good memory.

Anyway, you kiddies can keep on
fighting.  I can tell you two things
though:

1) First Class is behind none of the
   parties in this little skirmish.

2) Bart would not kick anyone's ass
   unless they fucked with HIM, and
   even then it's doubtful.

USAlliance, like it or not, has the
reputation of being a loser group.  All
you guys are doing is making it worse.

you have my application for RSA?  and I claimed to be MPG?  not hardly jerk.
why don't you even send it here?  of course you will have to edit it to get
the MPG part in it but thats ok isn't it?...hah hah....dude.  you are SUCH a
lozer.

Rotten Apple.  i would beat you up simply because i might want to.  Not
because of any reputation or anything but simply because you are a jerk and
have a mouth like the crasher....your buddy.....  god...you are soo pathetic.

of course it is pointless ot try to prove to you and the crashdick that I
know machine language and stuff so it has come to the point where we will
have to do something about that, eh?  as I said on razors edge.  simple a
little challenge.  right a machine code rag.  something interesting or
anything.  you and crasher can both work on it since you are both soo
k-kool...BAHAHAHAHAHAAA you guys didn't reply to my challenge so we'll see
how you do with it now.  you of course don't know machine language and even
though it isn't that hard you still don't and never will know it.  I KEEP
CALLING NAMES?  haahaahahah! then where is this hick stuff coming from???
heh....you are a pathetic lozer and thats that.  we'll see how you do on the
rag file.

name calling....i will call you any name I please when I please.  what are
you going to do about it rabi apple?  put me out of modeming?
hahahahahaha... i can't wait to here the reply to this one!

dave...ok....you wanna talk shit?  i havn't said anything mean to you because
I thought you had some interesting views on things.  but I will let the cat
out of the bag for you a little.  dude.  NOBODY likes you and necromancer
except a very few people who are into RSA.  i have talked to A LOT of pirates
and just modemers and not a damn one of them has ever said anything good
about you guys. as a matter of fact...most people I have ever talked to where
you guys have ever been mentioned has gone something like this.

BA...."...yeah, necromancer just put out so and so ware...."
??    "...oh god...that guy is such an arogant jerk...."
BA    "he is a good cracker though..."
??    "yeah...but him and that guy SA are jerks...."

that is the way EVERY conversation ever goes.  nobody likes you guys.  and
you say I am not liked?  hmmmm.....at least somebody like Rotten Apple and
The Crasher don't like me....  they seem to think very highly of you guys
though.

Dead Lord, I don't value people by how
well they can crack, either.  But
judging these people by the pirate
standards they use to judge everyone
else by, they are losers and nobodies.

I could give a shit if people like me
or not.  I know who my friends are, and
frankly it doesn't matter.  I'm not in
this to make friends.  In case you
haven't noticed, I don't share the
popular viewpoints about things.  I am
a nonconformist, or rebel if you will.

I think Dead Lord has done more for
piracy, by amusing us with his text
files, than USAlliance, Strata
Crackers, Circle of Deneb, and any
other loser pirate groups combined.

I'm just content to try to expose you
guys to alternate points of view.  If
you hate me, that's fine.  That's to be
expected.  After all, we are all
brought up to hate people who are
different.  I am different.  Hate me.

Look, Blue Adept, I haven't even called for a week and a half, and you are
getting your ass ragged on bad without any encouragement from me. Maybe I
won't join in, you seem to be having enough trouble with 3-4 people. Maybe
you better getting your bun, Body Glove, to call and take up for you.

And it seems you made yet another person quit USAlliance, Ware Pusher. First
me, and now him. I wonder who will be the next to quit because of your
lameness?

Also, Crasher and I are not friends. We just have combined our forces to
defeat you, who we hate more than each other. About the rag... go ahead,
worsen that reputation that you so much value, like its not bad enough
already. If you do, I know Gauntlet's going to have his ultimate rag ware
out, and since he's doing it, I don't have to worry about getting any
feedback about writing rag wares, as you do.

Razor's Edge is down forever, Body Glove crashed it, and overwrote all of the
system's files. I think BG has had his plan backfired on him, now he's the
one thats been framed. I told you guys I would destroy anything that got in
my way, and so I did, Razor's Edge is DOA.

don't like me.  and Crasher dosn't
like...me...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh.... i am mortified.  dude.  I
don't give a rats ass about you or your shit.  destroy me?  haha...not
hardly.  i am up and going good.  the reason you and crasher seem to have
such a wonderful hatred of me is obvious.  I showed both of you up
as massive lozers....you even cried about it..and now you attempt revenge.

You are quite sad, aren't you?

First of all, by friends I was referrng
to friends outside of modeming, or
"real ones" if you will.  I do know who
my friends are in modeming though.
Sadly enough, it seems you don't.  My
friends don't say anything about me and
I don't say anything about them.  I'd
like you to list these so-called
"friends" of mine who talk behind my
back.  I'll lay you 500:1 odds I didn't
consider them my friends in the first
place.

Secondly, what is this "RSA bimbo"
bullshit?  Are you putting down people
because they call RSA now?  What's
wrong?  Sad because we didn't let you
on?

Thirdly, why do you accuse all your
enemies of being friends with The
Crasher?  Obviously, that's the worst
thing anyone could be called but it's
getting old.  One would think you could
come up with something different by
now.

And finally, if you want to drag Ralph
into this why don't you put it
somewhere where he can read it?  He
doesn't call this BBS very often at
all.  Why don't you give him a call
voice and rag your heart out?  If you
don't have his number, either I or many
others would be glad to email it to
you.

Sonny, I think you actually might have things mixed up and you aren't lying
intentionally. OK, remember what happened? I was "demoted" to leader, then
you tried kicking me out, but it didn't work, because you didn't have a
majority vote of members. When I got tired of you blabbing for 2 hours,
whining because you couldn't kick me out, I just quit as you were about to
hangup. Then you go "No hard feelings?", then Doug said the same thing, and I
said okay.

point you were 'already' kicked out of the group.  You think I would waste my
time whining over kicking you out of the group for 2 hours?  Pfft, don't

Necromancer..beleiveing him to be some kinda of god who is of course never
wrong..never lies...and obviously never has to eat sleep or write his own
utilities to crack infocom warez.  i am talking about the fact that all the
people who are down on me on this sub are RSAers big time.  Rotten
Apple/YOU/Baron/lear...ect...

Crasher said that you and him were good friends.  he seems to be running his
mouth about your freindship quite a lot on boards like floating dragon
elite....and others local to him....(he has been kicked off every major board
around the country)....  he said that you guys were massivley impressed iwth
his cracking abilities..........,.....

Rotten Scrapple...you were KICKED out of the group....why try to keep denying
it?

oh, by the way.  Gauntlet has a secret key in it.  it has to do with crasher
and rotten apple....and what they like to do....heh heh.....it is one key
from the crack screen.

...Alan, have you ever stopped to think that maybe the reason everyone
listens to Ralph is becaus his opinions are sound, and he can back them up.
I'm sure he has gained a lot more respect over the years than you have
because he can keep his mouth shut.  You really don't have to voice your
opinion on everything.  "Somethings are better left un-said"  a wise man once
said.

of course none of those were the keys that I was talking about.  The secret
key that is in the boot is not a cheat for the game.

Lear, personally i disagree.  I think ralph is a lying arogant bastard who is
massively stuck on himself and gets off on the worship of others.  i don't
think his opinions are sound.  and i don't really beleive a lot of them.

Ya, it could, don't ask me, ask Cloneman..ahem.

I like how Blue Adapter couldn't spell faggit or buttfucks. He spelled
faggit, fagit, and buttfucks, buttfuckes. You are sorry, BA. I'm sure after
someone saw that, they immediately believed it..ya right. Believe me, BA, I
think the page on you will do more than call you names. Keep on going,
calling me names, its not getting you anywhere, dudette. But when the truth
is known on the next page and a little bit of maturity is shown, the whole
pirate world will think less of you.

Well, then I guess we have nothing good to look forward to until you get out
of college. Personally I am very much looking forward to the day you dont
touch Appes anymore, but you are a major diappointment to me and others in
this world. You always seem to have nothing intelligent to say. So therefore
I will be willing to drop this meaningless conversation with a 17 year odl
dweeb who acts like a 4 year old. I mean hell, Dennis..I can talk & converse
more with my 4 year old than I can with you, because you think you're so
fucking cool, and that you're so much better than everyone else. Besides, I
think everyone else is getting tired of reading lame posts from you and me
too, so I will drop the issue. I think I did what I set out to do and that
was to inform the world on what sort of person you are, and I guess I did
that.

And I know alot more about you than you think I know, so lets drop it Dennis?

You pissed me off and now I'm tired of fooling with you, so tthis is my last
post concerning you.
Good luck to you in college, you'll need it...

Ya right..14 year old bullshit. I guess you two are 11 year olds.. Alan you
do care about what I say, or you wouldn't respond. Don't dare sit here and
tell me you don't care. I know you do, you probably sit there crying after
you read my messages about you.

Ok, don't use proper spelling. You'd be suprised because the majority of the
pirate world looks down on people who can't spell or use proper english.
Everyone I've talked to has laughed when they heard you spelled it wrong. So
go ahead and keep spelling things wrong, its making my job easier. Thats like
saying "Here, rag on me, I'm a hick, I can't spell".

Body Glove and Blue Adept are true homosexuals. Look at how Blue Adept is
getting ragged on, then he calls up his buttbuddy, Body Glove, to protect him
from the people on MAD. We all know how anxious Sonny is to help him, because
he knows his reward. You guys are really sorry..

You two are really getting uptight. I know you two are really getting scared
because now even Sonny is starting to lie and call people names. Then, the
thing with the page on Gauntlet, that was the first sign. I can tell you one
thing, Psycho was not happy at all to hear that a CtC member got ragged on on
your page. You can look for future rags on Blue Adept, Body Glove, and Codex
Warrior on CtC wares as they come out. And since they put out more wares than
USAlliance ever could..

Maybe you better call Cotex Warrior so he can give you sometXrhelp.

continue to spell things wrong if it pleases me.  Quite literally I will do
anything I fucking please....and you can't do a thing about it.

hmmm...i guess you had to try to say that stuff about me and body glove since
you and crasher are romantically involved and you don't want anybody to know
about it.  kinda workds that. way....trying to envision others in situations
you are in.....bad move jew.  you showed yourself up pretty badly.  Do you

rag on themselves? God. It's so lame. Syntax Error in the main program. Haha.

I really think most people don't really give a shit about gnu warez d00d.  I
mean my newest is Kid Nikki.  Sad?  I don't think so.  The only thing most
people use it for is calling around or school.  Wares have no real big
interest in kids over 16.  Most kids who get their modem just go out to get
the wares. Did you know I JUST found out YESTERDAY that Ultima 5 was out?
How?  My friend from around here was in maryland and tricked his uncle into
getting it for him.

argue about it after you guys insisted on putting it out. I thought cracking
groups like yourself (haha) crack. No, instead you put out text files..really
smart, lamers. I don't see REAL pirate groups like Fc and CtC putting out
text file disks.. Get real! I guess since you guys can't crack you got
desperate.

Sonny, you did parachute down to my so-called level and said that about me
and Roman. Go back and read some of your old posts.. I guess you really
believe Psycho that hes not mad and he likes USAlliance, you are such a fool
if you believe that. Roman told me Psycho already modified CtC Boot to put in

 First off I would like to point out that YOU were the leader of group that
put out text files. And more text files. And ONLY text files. I may just have
to dig out "I wanna Phreak!" and "Scratch!". That little quote was directly
out of IWP. "Emdy Pirates" - Stevie's first pirating success. Going up is the
file which shows it all. Now, on to my next point, Bugle Boy (his old alias).



 To further illustrate Steve's phonyness/posing/bunning I have for you the
following evidence. I'm sure Mr. Rabbi Hornstein will agree that this rings

Actually, Mike, I quit the group last night. We had been doing good with
wares like Into the Eagle's Nest, Knight Orc, 816/Paint IIe, but personally,
I think the group's not going to last much longer. They just got another bad
crack, Carmen Europe, it crashes if you have a male suspect randomly. You
throw in Beyond Zork and Dremzone..... The group has given me an excellent
lifting-off point, though, because now I have the chance to work on some new

 As you can see, Rotten Crapple has been posing on many boards as to the

the losers. Should take some pressure off you. Or maybe an IBM, you seem to
bun real well with IBM people.  Also, you have a lot more to lose than we do

informing everyone about his rad text

screen the ware was gonna have,
sadness, i boot it up, only to find, a

myself "Well Shit! maybe their saving
it for the 100th edition!', well, now,
i was in gulfed in this ware, now! on
to see the RAD text file reader i heard
so much about...ACK!!!! David DOS II!!
oh no! i've been ripped off again. what

And I hadn't spoken to him for a long time, probably didn't know ML back then
anyway.

You are like the National Enquirer, changing the facts around. The first
message was when I didn't know Sonny had a minority vote to throw me out. The
second was when I quit. Lets just clear this up.. I was demoted from leader,
Sonny told me they took a vote to throw me out, a day later I found out that
he didn't have a majority vote needed to throw anyone out, a few hours later
we resolved that I was still in the group, but I quit.

I've asked alot of people from your school about you. They all tell me you
are just another nerd who walks around talking with the geeks about
computers. I even talked to one of geeky friends, who told me you gave him
wares, and wares like Pirates, Wizardry IV, and more, you put your name all
over them. Obviously, you unbooted the wares. They say all you have going for
you is a rich daddy Warbucks. Maybe he could buy you some friends, if you
stopped buying wares and saved some money. Even heard about how people go
around and say you are a fag. I feel sorry for you, get a life, dude..

Doug, stop turning your old shit around on me, you know you were the chief
leader of Emdy Pirates. You are so full of it.. let's just turn everything
that has gone wrong in your personal and modem life and pretend Rotten Apple
has the same kind of life. The reason you posted that stuff because you knew
I was going to post the same thing about you, except I'm telling the truth.
You just called here and posted here first..

When is USAtoday #2 coming out? Hope it's not too long a wait. I'd love to see
