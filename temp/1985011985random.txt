  I also saw this show, and it was pretty rad... I sure wish I had video taped 
 that instead of The Dirty Dozen... (think I could get a copy, Zaphod?)... 
 there was a movie a couple of years back with the same kinda atmosphere that 
 was also kinda rad... it was called The Lathe of Heaven, about a dude whose 
 dreams would come true... anyone remember it? I have it on videotape. Simon

  I saw "The Lathe of Heaven" and liked it too. I even went out and read the 
 book. Ursula K LeGuin is a good science fiction author. I read another of her 
 books after that, but I can't remember the title.

 Well, I make an observation about the MPG, (actually a few.) and then they 
 decide, Let's gang up on MC!    (Gee Wally ..... ) I'll believe the box of 10 
 prize when i see it. I will keep my trap shut about it till then. And you 
 guys (MPG members and such.) keep on neglecting the fact that Attic Man was 
 driving, not I (actually, I was driving his car for a while. I didn't know'how 
 to drive a manual. Killed the engine an infinite number of times.). So, get 
 your facts straight. I do not believe that all* the MPG members are over 18. 
 as the title says, 'Humph'.

 From: DAVE DUDERSTADT

   I WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH SOMEONE ABOUT THE USE OF ASCII EXPRESS PRO WITH THE 
 HAYES MICROMODEM IIE. I'M HAVING PROBLEMS DOWNLOADING FILES (HAVEN'T SO FAR!).

 I HAVE THE LIST OF BASIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE COMANDS, BUT I AM STILL NOT ABLE 
 T DOWNLOAD. THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF SELECTIONS FOR CONFIGURING THE PROGRAM 
 TO THE INDIVIDUAL COMPUTER. I HAVE A HAYES MICROMODEMIIE FOR EXAMPLE ( THE 
 INSERT PROGRAM TALKS OF A MICROMODEM II NOT IIE, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAKES A 
 DIFFERENCE OR NOT) THE PROGRAM SEEMS TO WORK FOR MOST EVERYTHING THOUGH. WHAT 
 DO I USE TO DOWNLOAD THE TYPICAL PROGRAMS FROM A BOARD? THERE'S 
 'GET','LOAD','AUTO SAVE','RECEIVE', AND 'X' FOR EXIT TO SUPPOSEDLY EXEC IF YOU 
 PICK; THAT IN THE INSTALL PROGRAM!!! I'M TOTATLY CONFUSED NONE OF THEM SEEM TO 
 WORK! COULD SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL OR LEAVE A SHORT DESCRIPTION ON HOW 
 I SHOULD DOWNLOAD. I ALSO HAVE SMARTCOMI WHICH I HAVE DOWNLOADED SOME PROGRAMS 
 ON BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO AN AUTO DOWNLOAD WHERE THE HEAD COMPUTER AUTO 
 SAVES TE PROGRAM TO DISK EXECING IT. I ONLY KNOW HOW TO SAVE A TEXT FILE, EDIT 
 IT WITHAPPLE WRITERII, THEN EXEC THAT. WHEN I TRIED TO LOAD A TEXT FILE FROM 
 HERE (MEGA MUSIC) I RAN OUT OF MEMORY FOR THE APLLE WRITER II PROGRAM. THANKS

 Why is it that, when you log on, you get the same privlidges as the unpaid,
 lazy, persistant caller type? and why is it that the MPG, the NDC, and the 
 Thought Police, have trouble getting in the same place at the same time? And
 why is it, that Attic Man, and Dr. Boogie both wanted to run me over when I was
 skitching?   "Let's put it in reverse!"

 I JUST RECENTLY OBTAINED ASCII EXPRESS PRO AND AM HAVING DIFFICULTY FIGURING 
 OUT HOW TO DOWNLOAD PROGRAMS WITH IT. I HAVE A HAYES MICROMODEM IIE. FIRST WILL 
 IT WORK WITH THE IIE SINCE ONLY THE MM II IS MENTIONED ON THE INSTALL PROGRAM? 
 WHAT COMMAND DO YOU USE TO DOWNLOAD? ('G'-GET. 'L'-LOAD A DOS SEQUENTIAL TEXT 
 FILE INTO CURRENT DATA BUFFER, '0'- AUTO-SAVE OPTION CAPTURE DATA, 'R' COPY 
 BUFFER TOGGLE, OR 'X'-EXITS AE PRO AND IF SPECIFIED IN THE "INSTALL" PROGR 
 AM
 EXECUTE UPON EXIT.) I CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANY OF THESE TO RECORD ON A DISK. I'M 
 SUE I'M JUST NOT DOING IT RIGHT. BASICALLY I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW TO DOWNLOAD

   I have received lots of response on the upload contest, but I think that 
 there should be more, especially along the lines of C64, IBM, and Macintosh 
 programs and files, most everything that I have received has been for the 
 Apple!

 So C64 users upload!
     IBM users upload!
     Mac users upload!
 Apple // users upload too!

 If anyone could help me with a problem with Wordstar, I would sincerely
 appreciate it. I have a copy that is an older rev. which does not support 
 modification of printer parameters without knowing the inside locations to 
 modify. Could anyone provide me information on:

                   The locations in Wordstar to modify for printer parameters 
                   such as underline, bold face, etc.

                   or ...

                   Tell me how to imbed control characters in the text itself, 
                   which would eliminate having to patch Wordstar.

 P.S. I am using an Apple w/z80 card and a C. Itoh Prowriter printer. 

 THank you.
