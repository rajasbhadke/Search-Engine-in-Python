     NEWS FROM THE ESTONIAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Clean-up of Damage to the Estonian Environment by 50 Years  of
Soviet-Russian  Military  Occupation  Will Cost Over 4 Billion
USD.

The Estonian Ministry of the Environment this week distributed
a  summary  report  of  the  amount  of  damage  caused to the
environment by 50 years of Soviet-Russian military occupation.
The  13-member  Government  Working  Group  places the cost of
repairing  the  damage  to   the   Estonian   environment   at
54,752,697,000  EEK (over 4 billion US dollars).  In addition,
loss of income to Estonia  and  non-payment  of  environmental
taxes adds up to another 4.4 billion EEK, for a grand total of
58.95 billion EEK.

The highest costs are connected  to  the  clean-up  of  former
Soviet  military  airfields  and  artillery  ranges  (over  11
billion  EEK)  and  two  areas  involving  radioactivity,  the
Paldiski  nuclear submarine training facility (40 billion EEK)
and the town of Sillamaee,  with accumulated radioactive waste
from a uranium plant (1.7 billion EEK).

The Soviet military controlled 83650.87 hectares (nearly 2% of
Estonian  territory)  on  which  were  located  570   military
installations  of various types and sizes.  Two hundred twelve
of these,  with a total surface area of 878.17 hectares,  were
located in the capital city of Tallinn.

The Working  Group  has  analyzed  about 85%  of the territory
which was in the hands  of  the  Soviet  military.  The  areas
suffering  damage  and the various military installations were
divided into groups according to use and type.  The damage  to
surface and ground water,  soil,  and the man-made environment
was studied and assessed. Not included were navigation devices
or an evaluation of the damage caused to Estonian forests.  To
date, the Working Group study has cost 9.8 million EEK.
