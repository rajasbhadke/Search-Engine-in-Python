Common to all Anarchists is the desire to free society of all political 
and social coercive institutions which stand in the way of the 
development of a free humanity.

In common with founders of Socialism, Anarchists demand the 
abolition of all economic monopolies and the common ownership of 
the soil and all other means of production, the use of which must be 
available to all without distinction. . . .(T)he Anarchists represent the 
viewpoint that the war against capitalism must be at the same time a 
war against all institutions of political power, for in history economic 
exploitation has always gone hand in hand with political ant social 
oppression. The exploitation of man by man and the domination of 
man over man are inseparable, and each is the condition of the other.
