had word protection in it.  The patch that I did made the other code real part
of the game not work.  When I found that out I put out the 18 60 18 60 18 60
to 18 60 18 60 38 60  patch.  That fixes it up.

and baron.  hah.  name some **** I've put out that is bad.  Your just trying to
get back into the same old rut now that necroprancer is lame and you can't get
your worthless name plastered on screens anymore.  You wanna hear about bad
cracks?  wanna let me start naming off all the ones that ralph put out that
either didn't have the word protection taken out of them or were just simply
bad cracks a while back?  thats what I thought.

you.

no ralphie.  the only thing lame around here is you and the bar0n.  why don't
you go back to deathstar where they love you?  deathstar hasn't been doing to
well has it?  haha

bad cracks.....right off hand I remember,  Wizardry V where you released it
without bothering to take the word protection out...and don't say you DIDN'T
release it, I still have the buffered posts where you announced it from
yourself, also: platoon, you didn't both to take out the secondary check that
kept you from having a compass in the dark....the nibble count wasn't the only
protection in it.  this isn't to say that I don't make mistakes, I just don't
go around acting like i'm perfect and doing g0dliKe kracks...face it ralph, you
are lame....i even remember when you made a big deal about word protections
early last year, saying that taking them out wasn't part of cracking a ware...
HAH...which reminds me, would you like me to bring up some of your releases
where you didn't take the word protection out...such as Pirates!...ect....get
off your wittle horse ralph before you make everyone sick.
