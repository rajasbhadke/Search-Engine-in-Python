THE EUROPEAN COUNTER NETWORK 

Sick of living in this world? Sick of a society run for profit,sick of being
robbed all our lives and forced to work or live in misery and povery? Fed up
with having no power over your own lives, divided by racism and sexism and ruled
by class power? Had enough of your discontent being exploited by politicos from
tories to the trotskyists? Want to fight back? Want to hear about other people
fighting back around the world? Well then ,get in touch! 

Here at the ECN we exchange news and info on the class war across Europe, via
computer link-ups that allow us to send regular updates on antifacism,strikes,
prison news, anti-poll tax, women's movements and much much more! As well as
sending the latest info over to groups in Holland, Germany and Italy (for a
start),we've published regular round-ups of news,dicussions on ways to organise
and the latest state tactics from here and abroad in our bulletin CONTRA FLOW
But we're not doing this for our health - we want to encourage other groups in
other areas to link up and exchange info about collective resitance to
capitalism. 

We'd like to see people produce their own info-bulletins,so that news gets out
wider than just you immediate area, so that we can hear about the other people
fighting back against poverty,misery and hierarchies. We want to see the ECN
used to make our movement stronger,create nw communties, strngthen confidence in
people's power to organise for ourselves and change or own lives. 

ECN is working with the FAST BREEDER COLLECTIVE, who will shortly be setting up
a computer bulletin board to allow other people round the country to tap into
the news at anytime of the day or night. 

GET INVOLVED - let us know - become a roving contraflow correspondent
