ok....that did it.  You pissed me off.  not the reply but something else.

dude. for a guy whos group name is first class you sure don't have ANY.
I was just informed that you have something like p0zer of the month on RSA and
I am the winner?  oh my god.  How old are you anyway.  You are starting to
sound like one of these 14{year old sysops.

i used to have a grudging respect for you but that is eroding and falling
away VERY quick.  Its hard to think highly of someone who's main freinds
include Queen Lear, Rotten Apple, The Crasher, and others of their ilk.  also
you seem to be fond of the word pozer.  if you think I am such a fucking
p0zer then lets talk voice sometime and see who the fucking pozer is.  I know
my shit and I know it well.  Just because Carmen wasn't a massively hard
crack at all dosn't mean somebody is inept or{anything like that.....christ.
i am hearing all sorts of shit from your buddy the crasher and queen leer.
geeee as easy as it was I wonder i{ one of these mighty gods of modeming
couldve cracked it?
hmmmmmmmmmm.................

as I said.  that really pissed me off pozer of the month.  dude.  If you have
a problem with me then lets talk and see whats up.  I am tired of
hearing{stupid shit like this.....crackers are becoming fewer and farther
between. {this might be true but we definatly don't need to be in a godamn
rag war.

later

that didn't make sense but I have since stopped trying to make sense of your
semiconcious ramblings.  You must have serious problems to hanging around
with the ilk of rotten apple...geeezzzzz...i will attempt to kick your ass if
I meet you at applefest and you decide to become demeaning and arrogant in my
face. Rotten Apple on the other hand is another matter.  Steve has been on a
mission of lies about USAlliance sinse we so insensitively kicked him.  he
definately has it coming.  I am just not so happy with you because of the
fake application and what you told everybody about the carmen crack.  both
not true so therefore I have a difference with you.
