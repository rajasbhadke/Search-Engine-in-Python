Getting Started
     1. Turn off the computer and connect a Joystick, if desired. Turn on
          the monitor or TV.
     2. Insert _The Dungeon_ Disk 1, Side 1 into Drive 1, close the door,
          and turn on the computer.
     3. Once you're familiar with the opening sequence, press the SPACE
          BAR or the Open Apple key to bypass it and go directly to the
          Character Decision menu.
     4. When the game is loaded, follow the prompts.

NOTE TO PLAYERS WITH TWO DISK DRIVES: After loading the game, put Dlsk 1,
Side 2 into Drive 1 and Disk 2, Side 1 into Drive 2.

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

Character Decision

The Character Decision menu offers four options:
     Hit 'N' to become a new person
     Hit 'E' to resume an existing one
     Hit 'T' to transfer a City character
     Hit 'U' for character utilities

Press 'N' to create a Character. You get a prompt that says "NOTE: IF YOU
     WISH TO KEEP THIS CHARACTER, YOU MUST HAVE A DUNGEON CHARACTER DISK
     READY WITH FEWER THAN 4 CHARACTERS ON IT."

     If you don't have a Dungeon Character Disk prepared, or if your only
     Character Disk akeady has four Characters saved on it, press ESC.
     This takes you back to the Character Decision menu. Press 'U' to
     create a blank Character Disk (explained below).

     If you have a Character Disk ready, type a name when you see the
     prompt "ENTER NAME:". The name must begin with a letter, not a
     number!

Press 'E' if you already have a Character from a previous venture into The
     Dungeon. Follow the prompts.

Press 'T' if you have a City Character you want to bring into The Dungeon.
     Make sure your City Character was saved in front of one of the two
     Dungeon entrances before you try to bring it into The Dungeon (see
     the Dungeon Guide for information on Dungeon entrances). You can't
     enter The Dungeon if you're Diseased or Poisoned.

Press 'U' to get a selection of Character Utilities:
     (1)  _Create a blank Character Disk_ formats a disk you can use as a
          Character Disk.
     (2)  _Backup a Character Disk_ makes a copy of a Character Disk. You
          can also use this selection to backup all sides of the game
          disks, except Disk 1, Side 1 (play with the backups and keep the
          originals in a safe place).
     (3)  _Remove a Character_ gets rid of any undesireable Character.

     Make your selection and follow the prompts.

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

Corrections
     If you make an error in any selections (in Character Decision or
     anytime during the game), press the ESC key to halt the process and
     go back to your current Menu.

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

To Enter the Portal
     After you've created a new Character, you're taken to The Dungeon
     Portal. To enter, press the SPACE BAR (this sets your Stats) and
     follow the prompts.

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

To Save a Character
     Save your Character when you're ready to stop playing or when you've
     built it up to a level you want to keep. Press 'S' and follow the
     prompts. Note: You can only save a Character while walking around The
     Dungeon (not during Encounters, while in buildings, etc.).

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

To Resurrect a Lost Character
     When a Character that you've saved and reloaded into the game dies,
     its not really dead (The Dungeon is nice that way). Instead, it's
     only "Lost". To restore your Lost Character, select 'E' and load it
     the same way you'd load any other Character. You'll be transported to
     the NE Dungeon entrance. Of course, the Character is now minus some
     Stat points (the price of resurrection).

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

Compass
     It's a lot easier to find your way around The Dungeon if you have a
     Compass (available at the D & P or, if you're lucky, in Treasure).
     When you own a Compass, its visible on the left of your screen.
     'North' is always at the top of the Compass; the arrow points in the
     direction you're heading.

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

Joystick Control
     The Joystick controls physical movement. Move forward by pushing Up
     on the Joystick, backward by pulling Down. Turn left or right by
     pushing the Joystick Left or Right. One of the four red arrows at the
     right of the screen lights up, showing you which direcbon you're
     heading.

     Pressing Joystick button 0 works the same as pressing the SPACE BAR
     anywhere in the game.

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

Time Indicator
     An 'X', located just under the word "Stats:" at the top left of your
     screen, spins when time is passing.

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

Hit Points
     Hit Points are displayed as "Hit Points =" or "Hit Points :". When
     you see the "=", your Hit Points are at their maximum level. The ":"
     means you've lost Hit Points and need rest or healing.

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

Keyboard Control
     You can move around The Dungeon using the Keyboard instead of a
     Joystick. Move forward by pressing 'I', backward by pressing 'K'. Use
     'J' to turn left and 'L' to turn right. One of the four red arrows at
     the right of the screen lights up, showing you which direction you're
     heading. You can also use the Apple Arrow keys for movement.

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

Other Important Information
     When you're walking along Dungeon corridors (exploring), text at the
     bottom of the screen shows you which level you're on and how many
     Food Packets, Torches, and Water Flasks you have. It also lets you
     know if you're hungry, thirsty, Diseased, Cursed, etc.

     To get information about other things you're carrying, as well as
     what Curses and Diseases you have, etc., press ',' (comma) and '.'
     (period) or '<' and '>'.

     Below is a list of options you can use in The Dungeon:

          C    Cast a Spell (only during Encounters or when exploring);
          D    Drop an item (only during Encounters or when exploring);
          E    Examine Spells or items (check your Inventory);
          U    Use an item (you can't light a Torch, use a Timepiece, or
               eat and drink during an Encounter);
          P    Pause the game (this suspends all time and activity; press
               any key to continue);
          G    Get an item you've dropped or discovered (you can't pick up
               anything during an Encounter);
          S    Save a game (only when exploring);
          Q    Quit a game without saving it;
          V    Turn sound OFF and ON.

     Press the ESC key to get out of an option after you've selected it.
     Example: You select 'C' to cast a Spell, then decide you don't want
     to cast a Spell after all; just press the ESC key and you'll be back
     where you were before you tried to cast the Spell.

PROLOGUE

Information in this manual was gathered entirely from Characters emerging
from The Dungeon. Some of these individuals were delirious or deluded;
others were sick or wounded; still others were simply "tall-tale tellers."
Every Adventurer has his own story; you'll have to sort out truth from
rumour for yourself. If your experiences differ, drop us a line.

Fantasy Role-Playing and The Dungeon
     Fantasy Role-Playing isn't like any other kind of computer game: you
     don't control the actions of a Character - you are the Character.
     "Role-Playing" means you actively partake in the adventure. Your
     individuality, intelligence, and reflexes affect your game
     Character's chances for survival.
     
     Fantasy games usually use a lot of unusual words and terms, so a good
     dictionary ii useful to have on hand in case there's something you
     don't quite understand.
     
     In The Dungeon, you anter the game with a set of characteristics (we-
     call them "Stats") that define your physical and mental attributes.
     As you wander around, getting your bearings and learning what's
     expected of you, you're also developing a personality. All actions
     and reactions are noted by the computer and stored as part of your
     Character.
     
     There's no set response for any situation; everything depends on your
     Character's Slats, personality, and conduct (and luck!).
     
     The basic strategy in playing The Dungeon is perseverance. You
     discover what's good or bad for, your Character by trial and error
     (use common sense).
     
     The Dungeon is a war Zone; the Trolls and Goblins have been battling
     each other since time Immemorial. Learn to use this eternal combat to
     your advantage.
     
     In The Dungeon. there are many Quests to complete and mysteries to
     solve. Special, one-of-a-kind items are there for the finding (and
     there may be more than one way to acquire these).

Goals
     Decide, very early, what your goals are.
     
     There are two choices for a long-term goal: return to Earth or stay
     in Alternate Reality and seek revenge on your captors. Long-term
     goals apply to the entire Alternate Flealily series, but also affect
     the way you behave in The Dungeon.
     
     Short-term goals change as your Character changes. At first, your
     main goal is (undoubtedly) staying alive! If you can learn to do
     this, other choices await: which Quests to follow, what creatures to
     befriend, etc. Keep in mind that making friends with anyone almost
     always means someone else will consider you an enemy.

The Oracle of Wisdom
     Some folks in The Dungeon provide hints, tips, and bits of
     information. Some of their rumours are helpful but many are wrong and
     useless. The Oracle, however, never lies. This all-seeing eye knows
     your life's history.... and your future. It only discloses important
     facts.

Note to City Veterans: The Oracle of Wisdom is located directly beneath
     the Floating Gate.

Encounters
     Whenever you meet someone (or, ick! some_thing_) you're having an
     Encounter. Encounters can be beneficial, mysterious, dangerous, or
     worse!

Menus
     In a Dungeon establishment and during Encounters, Menus at the bottom
     of the screen let you know what your courses of action are in a
     situation.

Dialogues
     Dialogues are words at the bottom of the screen that tell you what's
     happening during Encounters or in establishments. The text stays on
     screen for quite awhile so you have plenty of time to read it. Press
     the SPACE BAR to make it disappear sooner.

Commands
     Here are some imponant commands that aren't on any Menu (they're also
     listed on the Reference Card). "Exploring" means walking around in
     The Dungeon when you're not in an establishment, Encounter, or other
     sort of interaction.

     C    Cast a Spell (only during Encounters or when exploring).
     D    Drop an itom (only during Encounters or when exploring).
     E    Examine Spells or items (look at your Inventory; time "stops"
          when you do this, so you can check things out without fear of
          being attacked).
     U    Use an item (only during Encounters or when exploring; you can't
          light a Torch, use a Timepiece, or eat and drink during an
          Encounter).
     P    Pause the game (this suspends all time and activity; press any
          key to continue).
     G    Get an item you've dropped or discovered (you can't pick up
          anything during an Encounter).
     S    Save a game (only when Exploring).
     Q    Quit a game without saving it.

     See the Reference Card under "Other Important Information" to see how
     to cycle through your inventory. Doing this gives you information
     about items you're carrying, as well as what Curses and Diseases you
     have, etc.

Death
     Death occurs when your Hit Points drop to 0.
     
     There are many ways to expire in the dark Dungeon corridors: Poison,
     Disease, Curses, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and losing battles, to name
     a few. Turning off the computer without saving your Character is
     another way to die.
     
     At any moment, a Disease or Curse received a few days earlier could
     suddenly "kick in" and end your career. Get rid of negative nuisances
     like these at the first opponunity.
     
     When you die, your Character isn't removed from the Character Disk;
     it's still there, waiting to be revived. Reviving a Lost Character
     always costs you a randomly-selected Stat point ("Stats" are
     explained shortly).

Experienced AR - The City Adventurers
     If you think because you understood The City you'll also understand
     The Dungeon, you're in for a few shocks. Life and the rules are
     different Down Below! Read all the material in this manual, _even_
     the section on Stats.
     
     The purpose of The City was to develop yourself into a Character of
     awesome proportions and get oriented to the ways of Alternate
     Reality. The Dungeon is far more complex. Here, you'll embark upon
     Quests to solve some of The City's mind plaguing mysteries.
     
     Before leaving The City for the dank depths of The Dungeon, gather
     your wealth from all your Bank accounts.
     
     Warning: Once you've entered The Dungeon, there's no turning back!
     
     There are two entrances from The City into The Dungeon, One is at
     61N, 51E (highly recommended!) and the other is at 2N, 60E. Stand in
     front of either of these entrances and Save the game. Reboot your
     computer with The Dungeon disk, select 'T' (to transfer a City
     character) from the Character Decision Menu, and follow the prompts.
     
     If you aren't Saved in front of a Dungeon entrance, you can't enter
     The Dungeon (unless you create a new Character).
     
     Once you've entered The Dungeon, you need a fresh, blank disk for
     your Dungeon Character Disk (do NOT use your old City Character Disk
     to save a Dungeon Character). You can't use a Dungeon Character Disk
     in The City, but you can take it to other Alternate Reality scenarios
     (you can still use the City Character Disk in The City, though).
     
     Of course, you have to go through Customs where all but sixteen of
     your Potions are confiscated (sorry). Unlike items in The City, those
     in The Dungeon have weight. You can bring any number of items into
     The Dungeon, but you could be immobilized by your load. If this
     happens, drop a few things until you're able to move. Don't leave
     behind anything vital; it will undoubledly be stolen before you can
     return for it.
     
     There are many familiar life forms in The Dungeon; however, there are
     plenty of new creatures that The City did not prepare you for. Be
     cautious. Be friendly. But be ready to flee or fight.

Newcomers to Alternate Reality
     The Dungeon is the second scenario in the Alternate Reality series.
     It's not necessary to buy the first game, The City. However, life in
     The Dungeon is more difficult at first for a new Character than it is
     for a well-developed City Character (who said life was fair?).
     Characters created in The Dungeon can be used in future installments.
     
     This is how you become trapped in Alternate Reality....
     
     You're kidnapped by an alien spaceship and find yourself in a room
     with only one exit. Looking through the portal into the gloom, you
     see The Dungeon.
     
     An energy field moves across the opening. Overhead is a panel with
     constantly changing numbers. As you go through the door, the numbers
     freeze, as if you had pulled the lever to a cryptic slot machine.
     This sets your levels of Stamina, Charm, Strength, Intelligence,
     Wisdom, Skill, Wealth, and Hit points, The higher these beginning
     Stats, the better your chance of survival.
     
     The first few days find you extremely vulnerable to foul play. Keep a
     low profile until you're familiar with the surroundings. Keep an eye
     on your Stats; you can become cold, hot, hungry, thirsty, tired,
     diseased, poisoned, or cursed (and these are some of the tamer
     things). Use what little money you have carefully. A Compass, sold at
     the Damon & Pythias Shoppe (the D & P), is a wise investment.
     
     At first, concentrate solely on surviving and building your
     Character. Only when you feel prepared should you venture on Quests.

     Note: Save games and backup your Character Disk regularly.

STATS

The values (Stats) at the top of the screen give a lot of important info
about your Character.

Stats are increased by Magic and by moving uP a Character Level. They can
be decreased by Magic, Disease, poison, Curses, hunger, thirst, fatigue,
and other fun factors.

_Experience_ is gained through Encounters with life forms (you start the
     game with Experience points and Character Level at 0). The more
     Encounters you live through, the more Experience points you rack up.

     When Experience points build to somewhere between 250 and 300, you
     move up a Character Level. This usually increases other Stat points
     as well. Each Character Level requires about twice as many Experience
     points as the one before.

_Stamina_ is important if you're to survive. This Stat determines your
     health, endurance, and resistance to magic.

_Charm_ determines how other life forms react to you. The higher your
     Charm, the better your chances are for making friends. "Transactions"
     (see Encounters) and bargaining are more likely to go well for a
     charming Character.

     Note to City veterans: There's no battle tactic of "charming" as
     there is in The City.

_Strength_ is crucial when you're fighting. The stronger you are
     initially, the better, since you enter The Dungeon armed with nothing
     but your bare hands (unless you come in with Weapons from The City).
     Later, when you acquire Weapons, your expertise with them depends on
     Strength and Skill. Strength also determines the size and number of
     combat implements you can carry. Prolonged battles in which you're
     ultimately the victor may improve your Strength.

_Intelligence_ is crucial for casting Spells. Tricking enemies also
     depends on this Stat, but Tricking is an Evil act (see Moral
     Alignment).

_Skill_ helps you avoid blows from an adversary. It also aids you in
     wielding battle Weapons.

_Wisdom_ enhances your Intelligence. It's the Stat that determines how
     many Spells you can learn and how easily you're able to identify
     Potions.

_Hit Points_ are very important: the more you have, the harder you are to
     kill (death occurs when Hit Points go to 0)! As you ascend Character
     Levels, Hit Points increase.

Note: You are closely monitored! Many things, including your personality,
     are constantly being taken into account by the computer. But the
     Stats on the screen don't tell the whole story (there wouldn't be
     much mystery if they did).

Phyical Speed
     Speed controls how swiftly you can escape disagreeable Encounters. It
     also governs how fast you can walk. Speed is adversely affected by
     many things, including overeating, carrying large loads, and getting
     too cold.

Moral Alignment
     New Characters enter The Dungeon with Neutral morality (neither Good
     nor Evil). Characters from The City come in with whatever Moral
     Alignment they earned there. You're responsible for your own Moral
     Alignment. Being Evil may be easier in the short run, but Good is
     probably better overall.

     Evil acts include: Attacking Good or Neutral life forms with no
     provocation, Tricking _any_ life form (yes, it's Evil to trick evil
     life forms!), and Stealing.

     You must really be on your toes to develop and maintain a Good
     Character! Avoid battles whenever you can and be careful about which
     Guilds you join. Good deeds are remembered. As in real life, the
     straight and narrow is not the easy path (but it should offer greater
     power)!

     Use common sense in determining what makes up Good or Evil behaviour.
     If something seems like a nasty thing to do, it probably is!

Getting Around In The Dungeon

When you enter The Dungeon at the North-East entrance (this is where all
new Dungeon Characters are "born"), you're in a "Well-Lighted Area." But,
for the most part, The Dungeon is as dark as... well, as dark as a
Dungeon. You need a Torch or some sort of magic to see well enough to get
around. Of course, magic is the ideal solution, since carrying a Torch
means you can only have one Weapon ready (you can use the Torch as a
flaming club, but you risk losing it). Read more about Weapons under
_Weapons and Armour_.

Cold or heat strikes without warning and affect Stats if you aren't
dressed properly. Ensure that you're adequately protected against the
elements. Heatstroke or a chill are possible results of being unprepared,
Being cold makes you hungry and slow, while heat produces thirst and
fatigue!

Time
     An Alternate Reality year has twelve months, thirty 24-hour days in
     each.

     1 Alternate Reality Hour = About 4 Earth Minutes.

     The months of the year are: Rebirth, Awakening, Winds, Rains,
     Sowings, First Fruits, Harvest, Final Reaping, The Fall, Darkness,
     Cold Winds, Lights.

     When you see the prompt PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE or when you're
     selecting items or Spells from your Inventory, time stops. Otherwise,
     time passes normally. However, when you're sleeping or attending
     classes at a Guild, time passage is (thankfully) sped up so you don't
     spend forever waiting to wake up or get out of school (if only
     reality was like this!).

Mapping
     If you're a former City-dweller, the Map you made there gives you a
     bit of assistance in getting oriented in The Dungeon, because some
     Dungeon locations are situated beneath their corresponding City
     locations (e.g., the Palace Prison is beneath the Palace).

     However, both newcomers and City veterans are on the same footing
     concerning the network of passages, since Dungeon corridors are
     totally different from City streets.

     Use the 64 x 64 grid in the centre of this manual for building your
     Level One Map. Make photocopies of the grid and keep the original
     intact (everyone makes mistakes!).

     Look closely at The Dungeon's walls. Notice the vertical lines. The
     distance between these lines corresponds to one square on the grid.
     The number of steps it takes to travel one square of distance depends
     on your Speed.

     Level Two of The Dungeon is a 32 x 32 grid; Level Three is 16 x 16;
     and (surprise!) Level Four Is 8 x 8. Each level is situated squarely
     beneath the centre of the preceding level.

     Helpful Hint: Graph paper is ideal for making Maps of these levels.

     When numbering your Map grids, start at the bottom, left-hand corner
     and number that first square 0 North, 0 East.

     A Compass (see _Compass_) is essential for keeping track of where you
     are, so don't leave the Well-Lighted Area without one. In The City
     you had the sky and the mountains to assist with navigation, but no
     heavenly bodies or earthly hillocks help you here!

     Note: There's a relatively simple way of getting around Level One's
     perimeter: use The City Sewer. Traverse this low, dank passage, but
     look out for Rats, Mold, Slime, and other unsavoury Sewer citizens!

Doors
     As you travel through The Dungeon, you'll see many doors. Some doors
     are ordinary, everyday portals; just walk right in. Others are
     invisible or require special skills, equipment, or knowledge to
     enter. Examine Doors that won't let you enter to find out what kind
     they are; if you don't learn on the first examination, try again
     until you do.

     If you bump into a wall and hear an odd melody, it means you are
     actually going through a Secret, invisible Door (mark this on your
     Map).

     With the right Spell, you can see Secret Doors; they'll look like
     regular doors, but the odd melody you hear when you go through them
     tips you off that they're Secret (again, jot this on your Map).

     Other door types include: Locked, Bolted, and Enchanted. Each of
     these can be opened by only one method: Locked Doors must have Magic
     Keys (they don't stay unlocked for long). Bolted Doors require
     Strength (crashing into doors is painful - it can knock off a few Hit
     Points). Enchanted Doors need Intelligence. Bolted and Enchanted
     Doors don't always open on the first try. If you can't enter them
     after repeated efforts, return later and try again.

     Some doors are One-Way Doors; you can pass through only from one
     side... the other side is a solid wall.

Walls
     Different areas of The Dungeon have different Wall types (they _look_
     different): some are regular stone, some are ice crystals, etc. This
     can be helpful when Mapping.

     One-Way Walls are only visible on one side; you can pass through the
     invisible side, but trying to go through the _visible_ one only
     proves embarrassing (thud!).

ITEMS & TREASURE

Certain articles are necessary for survival; others you'll need in pursuit
of Quests.

Torches, Food Packets and Water Flasks, Clothing, Compasses, Timepieces,
and Weapons and Armour can be purchased at the Damon & Pythias Shoppe. Buy
Potions at Lucky's Potion Brewery. These things can also be found as
Treasure (just lying about or acquired after a successful Encounter).

Keys, Gems and Jewels, Money, Crystals, Wands, Scrolls, Trump Cards,
Tomes, Eyes, and Horns, as well as other items more difficult to
categorize, are only found as Treasure.

Some Treasure may be Magical or Cursed. Magical items are usually very
valuable (see Magic); Cursed Treasure brings misery (see Curses).

How many things you can haul around depends on Strength, plus the size and
weight of the items you're lugging. Check your Inventory(press 'E')
occasionally to see how efficiently you're managing objects. Otherwise,
you may be unpleasantly surprised when you become IMMOBILIZED! and items
your Stats don't allow for start falling to the ground (you can still
move, but _very_ slowly).

You can drop objects at any time while you're in a Dungeon corridor (press
'D'). Dropped items can be picked up again (press 'G'), _if_ they haven't
been pinched by other creatures or evaporated by Magic.

To use an object, press 'U' and follow the prompts. A Compass, if owned,
is always in use.

An asterisk (*) marks Inventory items you're wearing or wielding.

Torches
     Unless you can see in the dark, you need Torches (available at the
     D&P). To light Torches, press 'U'. Carry these firebrands as
     Secondary Weapons (they make _okay_ Primary Weapons against some
     creatures, especially if you don't have anything else to defend
     yourself with!).

     If your Torch is your Primary Weapon and you want to use something
     else in that position, switch the Torch to your secondary Weapon
     first. If you just "replace" the Torch with the new item, the flame
     dies.

     If you drop a Torch or it's knocked out of your hand during battle,
     it goes out. Don't bother picking it up (you can't relight a dead
     Torch). Eventually, all Torches burn out, becoming useless, charred
     sticks.

Clothing
     You enter The Dungeon with a bare minimum of clothing (unless you
     brought some from The City). Although this is fine for hot areas,
     you'll be in trouble in ice-cold corridors.

     The very best clothes are found in Treasure or after an Encounter.
     You _can_ buy your threads at the The D&P, but all sales are final
     and there's no guarantee you'll get your money's worth.

     Some clothing is magical and some even offer elements of protection.
     An Elven Cloak lets you blend into your surroundings, making you
     harder for enemies to see; Elven Boots add 32 points to your Speed; a
     Crystal Belt adds 20 points to your Stamina. There are other
     fantastic duds, but these are the only ones we're giving away.

     Aside from the Magical and protective advantages, clothes also have a
     "dapper" value. Some life forms are influenced by the style, fabric,
     or colour of what you wear (and some are outraged by what yuo _don't_
     wear - refrain from traipsing about in the all-together!).

     Just carrying clothes around is pointless; you have to wear them to
     get any benefits. To don attire, press 'U' and follow the prompts.

Food Packets and Water Flasks
     When you step through the portal into The Dungeon, you're supplied
     with three Food Packets, three Water Flasks, and three Torches. These
     are imperative staples!

     Eat and drink in moderation; you don't want to overdo and become
     bloated. If you overindulge, you'll be too stuffed to even drink
     water (bad news if you're dying of thirst). Potions will be out, too.
     A gluttonous Adventurer is slow-moving and klutzy in combat.

     Use a Food Packet or Water Flask by pressing 'U', then following the
     prompts. Replenish your stock at the D&P.

Compass
     This is one of the most important items for a Character to own.
     Before you leave the Well-Lighted Area to explore the rest of The
     Dungeon, go to the D&P and buy one (unless, of course, you're able to
     _find_ one)!

     Once purchased, your Compass is displayed at the left of the screen.
     There are no letters (N, E, W, S) on the Compass, but the arrow
     always points in the direction you're heading (naturally, North is at
     the top of the Compass).

Timepiece
     There will be occasions when you could use a good Watch. Buy a
     Timepiece at the D&P or find it as Treasure after an Encounter.

     To use your Timepiece, press 'U' and follow the prompts.

     Note: A Timepiece doesn't tell the date (get that info at The
     Retreat), just the hour.

Keys
     Magic Keys can be found as Treasure after Encounters. Any Key opens
     any Locked Door. Once a Magic Key is used, it disappears.

Gems and Jewels
     Exchange these valuable items for Money at the D&P (keep in mind that
     some Dungeon residents appreciate receiving these baubles as gifts or
     in trade).

Money
     Currency is in Gold, Silver, and Coppers. One Gold piece is worth 10
     Silvers; one Silver is worth 10 Coppers.

     Some Dungeon establishments insist on payment in items other than
     cash (Gems, Jewels, Crystals, etc.).

Crystals
     These beautiful stones store magical energy that's used to fuel
     Wands.

Wands
     These magical rods use Crystals for power. Each use of a Wand
     requires a new Crystal.

     Cold Wand
          Does "Cold Damage" to all monsters (especially valuable against
          Flame Demons).

     Fire Wand
          Does "Fire Damage" to all monsters.

     Paralysis Wand
          Paralyzes all monsters; they can't fight back until the
          paralysis wears off.

     Fear Wand
          Makes most monsters retreat in terror. However, there are a few
          beasts so vile that the Fear Wand only makes them vicious with
          rage, causing them to attack.

     Light Wand
          Gives you approximately 6 hours of liqht (use it if you have no
          Torch or other means of illumination).

     Healing Wand
          Restores up to 50 lost Hit Points.

Eyes
     These can be used a limited number of times, then they disappear. So
     use them only when absolutely necessary.

     Ruby Eye
          Does "Fire Damage" to all monsters.

     Emerald Eye
          Does "Water Damage" to all monsters (especially valuable against
          Flame Demons)

     Sapphire Eye
          Does "Air Damage" to all monsters.

     Amber Eye
          Does "Earth Damage" to all monsters.

     Wizard's Eye
          Lets you see Secret Doors and gives you light (for a limited
          time).

     Hypnotic Eye
          Bewilders all monsters. This keeps them from hitting you unless
          you hit them first.

Horns
     Blow these magic Horns to get special benefits. When their music is
     exhausted, the Horns dematedalize.

     Bronze
          This Cornucopia adds 5 Food Packets and 5 Water Flasks to your
          Inventory.

     Silver
          This Instrument does melodic mayhem to Evil monsters.

     Gold
          This healing Horn restores your Hit Points to their highest
          possible level.

Wepons & Armour
     There are many types of Weapons and Armour. Any item's "battle value"
     is determined by: the type of creature fighting you; your Moral
     Alignment; your Strength and Skill levels; and whether your battle
     accoutrements are Magical.

     Some Weapons and Armour, even Magical ones, can wear out or break
     (you'll usually be warned so you can get them repaired). Broken
     implements simply disappear.

     There are four ways to get Weapons and Armour:
          1. Find them after an Encounter;
          2. Find them after uncovering a Treasure;
          3. Buy them at the D&P;
          4. Buy them from The Dwarven Smithy.

     Press 'U' to use a Weapon or piece of Armour. You'll be asked whether
     you want to use a Weapon as a Primary or Secondary Weapon. Your
     Primary Weapon is the one that's ready to use immediately; the
     Secondary is ready at a moment's notice. There's an option during
     Encounters to Switch from Primary to Secondary Weapon (see
     Encounters).

     There's no "ideal" Weapon that works against all life forms, so a
     wise Adventurer will carry more than one kind of Weapon.

     Some Weapons are best handled with both hands (staffs, for example);
     it you're using a Secondary Weapon at the same time, you won't wield
     the two-handed Weapon too effectively.

     Bigger weapons are nastier than smaller ones (surprise), but are
     harder to handle. If you're puny or clumsy (or both), don't even
     think about using Great Swords or Triple Irons.

     NOTE: If your Stats don't allow you to use a certain Weapon, try
     using it two-handed; select it as your Primary Weapon and don't use a
     Secondary one.

     Armour comes in pieces for protecting specific body parts: head
     (helmets, caps), torso (breastplates, mail coats), legs (greaves,
     leggings), and arms (gauntlets). Any Mail offers more protection than
     Quilted or Leather Armour and Plate Armour is more effective than
     Mail (Crystal Plate is even stronger than Plate).

     Cursed Weapons & Armour
          If you pick up a Cursed Weapon or Armour, you become Cursed.
          Even if you drop the Cursed object, you're still Cursed (find a
          Guild that's willing to help you out of this predicament).

          When you find Weapons or Armour, check your Stats after picking
          up each piece. This way you can know which ones (if any) are
          Cursed.

     Enchanted Weapons & Armour
          Several Spells can temporarily enchant Weapons and Armour. You
          can even add _extra_ zap to Magical armaments by enchanting them
          (a "double-whammy").

          If you need to "un-enchant" a Weapon in a hurry, press 'U' and
          select the Weapon. Simply Switching Weapons during combat won't
          remove the enchantment.

     Alignment
          Some Weapons are sensitive to Good and Evil (and even to
          _degrees_ of Good and Evil). Evil Characters that use Good
          Magical Weapons and Good Characters that use Evil Magical
          Weapons will suffer. If you do something strange (morality-
          wise), your Weapons may let you know about it.

          Example: You're a Good Character, carrying a Good sword. You try
          to stab a harmless Pauper (obviously not the action of a Good
          Guy). The sword screams in fury and drains your Hit Points! Will
          the Weapon ever calm down? Not likely. Lose it immediately. Any
          other Good Weapons could turn riotous, too.

          Some items don't wait for you to make mistakes; they have minds
          of their own. For no apparent reason they'll become obstinate,
          drain your Hit Points, burst into flames... whatever is most
          inconvienent at the time.

     Ammunition
          A few Weapons require ammunition. For example, you obviously
          can't use a crossbow without quarrels.

          You can only load ammunition into your Primary Weapon (if the
          one you want to load is Secondary, switch). When you load a
          Weapon, any ammo left from a previous loading is discarded (so
          don't reload until absolutely necessary). An ammo-metre (a
          number in [ ] after the ammo's name) lets you know how many
          shots are left.

     Unusual Weapons
          Everyone has a pretty good idea of what Swords, Battle Hammers,
          and Flails are. However, some Dungeon Weapons are a little more
          exotic. The following list defines these:

          BASELARD       Short Sword/Dagger
          CINQUEDEA      Wide-bladed Dagger
          CLAYMORE       Heavy Broadsword that requires Two-handed use
          CROSSBOW       Firing Device made by Dwarves; uses a clip of
                         Quarrels
          DAITO          Curved Samurai Sword that needs Two-Handed use
          FALCHION       Curved Sword; wider at the tip
          GLADIUS        Roman-style Short Sword
          GLAIVE         Hooked War Scythe
          KATANA         Curved Samurai Sword
          KATAR          Triangular-bladed Punching Dagger
          KRIS           Wavy-bladed Knife
          KUKRI          Curved-bladed Longknife with the edge on the
                         inner arc
          KUSARIKAMA     Hand Scythe with a long chain attached to the
                         handle
          NUNCHAKU       Flail formed by two metal rods linked by a short
                         chain
          SKEAN          Short Dagger
          STILLETTO      Long, narrow Dagger
          TRIPLE IRONS   Three metal rods linked together with a chain

Scrolls
     Magical Scrolls have special powers. You can only use them once, then
     they disappear.

     Fireblade
          This Scroll adds Fire Damage (up to 1 hour's worth) to any
          Weapon being used.

     Frostblade
          This Scroll adds Cold Damage (up to 1 hour's worth) to any
          Weapon being used.

     Clout
          This Scroll adds enhancement (up to 1 hour's worth) to a blunt
          Weapon.

     Renew
          This Scroll restores any Weapons or Armour you're currently
          using to their former glory.

     Remove Curse
          This Scroll gets rid of all Curses you're saddled with.

     Wizard Eye
          This Scroll has a short-term effect that lets you see Secret
          Doors and gives you light.

Trump Cards
     These magical cards have special powers. Except for the King of
     Wands, the High Priestess, and the Fool, the effects of cards aren't
     time-limited. Cards disappear after use.

     _The Star_ adds 20 valuable Crystals to your Inventory.

     _The Fool_ temporarily increases your Luck.

     _The Heirophant_ summons a Healer.

     _Death_ kills practically any monster. Just remember, if you're
          confronted by a multitude of monsters, this card kills only one
          of them!

     _Ace of Cups_ gives you a new beginning with Guilds you were
          previously enemies with.

     _The Chariot_ increases your Skill by 1 point.

     _Strength_ increases your Strength by 1 point.

     _Ace of Wands_ relieves fatigue.

     _Temperance_ cures Drunkenness.

     _King of Wands_ confers invulnerability to Fire (up to 3 hours).

     _Page of Cups_ cures hunger and thirst and their effects.

     _Ace of Pentacles_ adds 100 Gold pieces to your Inventory.

     _High Priestess_ gives you limited protection from all attacks for up
          to 6 hours.

Tomes
     These powerful books deliver special skills. Use them once, then they
     melt away. Their effects aren't time-limited.

     _Tome of Knowledge_ adds 1 point to your Intelligence.

     _Tome of Understanding_ adds 1 point to your Wisdom.

     _Tome of Leadership_ adds 1 point to your Charm.

Potions
     There are many different Potions. Some are advantageous in advancing
     your Character; others are detrimental. Many Potion effects are
     temporary or time-limited. To drink a Potion in your inventory, press
     'U' and follow the prompts.

     Wisdom helps you perceive a Potion's contents.

     One way to ascertain the contents of an unidentified Potion is to
     gulp it down. The only other way is to go to Lucky's Potion Brewery.
     For a fee, Lucky analyzes and identifies your Potions. Lucky also
     sells Potions, so you'd best stock up while you're there.

     If you can't make it to Lucky's (or can't afford his services), some
     Potions, like Strength and Invulnerability, make Potion-chug-a-
     lugging worth any possible risk.

     Potions of Inebriation aren't fatal, but they'll make you wish you
     were dead! When tipsy, your movements have all the grace of a sick
     sandcrab; you pick fights you couldn't possibly win; and you
     generally act like a total nincompoop. Find a Temperance Card or
     sleep it off (a smashed Adventurer is nobody to be proud of!).

     Below is a partial list of Potions; the brew's name gives you a good
     idea of its effects.

     ! Potions of Fleetness, Strength, Intelligence, Charisma, and
          Dexterity give you time-limited (up to 8 hours) increases in
          your Speed, Strength, Intelligence, Charm, and Skill,
          respectively.

     ! Invulnerability Blunt, Sharp, Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Mental, and
          Cold give you temporary armour against attacks involving these
          elements. Example: Invulnerability Sharp gives you protection
          against Swords, Daggers, etc.

     ! Endurance relieves fatigue.

     ! Regeneration is a phenomenal Potion to use during battle: it
          increases your Hit Points by 2 per minute for up to 1 hour.

     ! Potions of Super Vision temporarily give you the power to observe
          Secret Doors and to see in the dark.

     ! Infravision lets you, see in the dark (for up to 8 hours).

     ! Cleanse, Antidote, and Restoration Potions cure Diseases, clean out
          Poison, and cure all wounds, respectively.

     ! Healing Potions restore up to 25 lost Hit Points.

     ! Hemlock causes the loss of 2 Hit Points every 20 minutes.

PLACES

There are several major locations in The Dungeon. Here are a few to get
you started.

Damon & Pythias Shoppe
     The D&P, located next to the main Dungeon entrance, is the only
     "general store." It accepts normal currency (except coppers) and
     serves as a money-changer.

     There's aisle after aisle of expensive, albeit slightly shoddy
     merchandise: Compasses, Watches, Torches, and all manner of clothing
     and armaments.

     D&P quality is never confused with that of a Bond Street or Rodeo
     Drive store, so don't bet your life on the sturdiness of their Swords
     (lest you absolutely have no choice). The Torches, however, are first
     rate.

     Bargain for low prices, but don't insult the shopkeepers, Honest Omar
     and his twin brother Jeff. You'll be asked to leave if you "offend"
     them (this is not a service economy)!

The Retreat
     The Dungeon has only one Inn, located in the Well-lighted Area near
     the Northeast Dungeon Entrance. It's nothing fancy, the decor is
     "early rescue mission", but at least you've got a place to sleep (on
     the floor). A "donation" is required.

     While you're sleeping, Dungeon time passes at the sped-up rate of
     approximately _4 Earth-time seconds to 1 AR hour_. If you sleep until
     The Retreat management wakes you, you'll snooze anywhere from 8 to 20
     hours (depending on how tired you are and where you sleep). Press the
     SPACE BAR to wake up sooner.

     Dozing is crucial to restoring Hit Points but you use up nourishment.
     Also, any Curses, Diseases, or Poisons you have may become active
     while you're asleep. Check your Stats periodically and be careful
     about snoozing 'round-the-clock; it's humiliating for an adventurer
     to die in his jammies!

Der Rathskeller Bar & Grille
     At this Tavern you can buy food and drink for on-the-spot enjoyment
     (some purchases also add Food Packets to your inventory - like taking
     out "doggy bags"). Remember, don't stuff yourself (see Food Packets
     and Water Flasks), but do leave a tip for the service (approximately
     15% is appropos).

     Alcohol is served; but, as in real life, drink only in moderation. If
     you're drunk, you'll have trouble walking, fighting or staying alive
     (you don't want to wind up a Der Rathskeller statistic, do you?).

     If you're feeling friendly toward your fellows, buy a round for the
     house. But remember, the cost of this generosity depends on how many
     people are in the establishment. Buying rounds is also an expensive
     way to avoid getting drunk since you aren't served when you treat
     your pals.

     Der Rathskeller is The Dungeon's "social centre", so you'll
     undoubtedly meet a few strangers. They'll chat with you, but take
     everything they say with a grain of salt. Before you buy anyone a
     drink or a meal, be sure you have enough funds (it's _their_ choice
     of which drink or meal and some refreshments are expensive).

Fountains
     There are three thirst-quenching Fountains hidden in The Dungeon's
     depths. In addition to relieving thirst, each Fountain has its own
     special magic: one Fountain heals wounds, one cleanses Diseases, and
     one removes fatigue. Drink deeply!

Bank Vaults
     There are two subterranean Vaults: one under The City's Gram's Gold
     Exchange; the other beneath First City Bank. You may want to visit
     these since they house piles of money (mostly in Coppers). You'll be
     given a choice of: Grabbing some cash; Searching for more goods; or
     leaving.

     Obviously, you'll be making an illegal withdrawal (Evil Act) for
     which there may be substantial penalties. The banks are constantly
     beefing up security so the longer you Search before heisting the
     loot, the more Guards you'll have to contend with.

Lucky's Potion Brewery
     Lucky is an alchemist who brews Potions to sell to those fortunate
     enough to find his establishment. New Potions are concocted every
     day.

River Station
     For a small fee, the ferryman at the River Stonz will take you across
     to the Realm of the Undead (everyone's favourite holiday spot!). You
     can only cross the Stonz at midnight; the ferryman will take you
     downriver at any other time.

Weapon Enchantress
     This serene sorceress examines, enchants, or repairs your Weapons
     (for a price). She can also reveal something about their powers, and
     even lend a touch of enchantment to Mundane Weapons (expensive!).

Chapel
     The Chapel initially offers three options: Pray, Consult with a
     Priest, or Hear a Sermon.

     _Praying_ may or may not be beneficial; you have to try it to see
          what happens.

     _Consulting with a Priest_ is practically the only way you can tell
          what your Moral Alignment is. If your soul is very dark, you
          might be offered the chance to Repent.

     _Hearing a Sermon_ is useful for learning what types of behaviour are
          "good" in The Dungeon. This activity can also be beneficial to
          your Moral Alignment.

     The Chapel has been known to provide sanctuary for wonderfully moral
     Characters.

Dwarven Smithey
     Here's the one place where you can purchase quality Weapons & Armour.
     These are made from the pure, precious metal known as True-Silver.
     True-Silver has naturally inherent qualities and only the Dwarves
     know how to use them.

     The Smith sometimes buys your old Weapons and Armour (for scrap, of
     course).

%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#

GUILDS

There are only six Guilds that have corresponding City locations; three
are Evil (Wizards of Chaos, Thieves' Guild, Dark Wizards' Guild) and three
are Good (Guild of Order, Wizards of Law, Light Wizards' Guild). The
Paladins (nice guys) and Mercenaries (rotten guys) are Guilds not found in
The City.

Any Guild you're a member of will remove your Curses. And if ou're really
down-and-out, your fellow Guildsmen may lend you a hand.

Each Guild has Character Level and Moral requirements for membership. You
may join one Primary Guild and become an "associate" member at others. A
Guild won't admit you if you're a member of its "arch-rival" Guild.

Your Primary Guild is the first Guild that accepts you. At your Primary
Guild you're allowed a locker to store provisions (Keys, Money, Gems and
Jewels, Crystals, Food Packets and Water Flasks, unlit torches, etc.;
sorry, no Weapons).

Once you're a Guild member, avoid killing members of your own Guild. If
you do this, or commit other acts that significantly change your Moral
Alignment, the Guild warns you. If you continue on the path away from your
Guild's values, you will be banned from that Guild forever.

Your Primary Guild gives you a nifty Ring that marks you as a Guild member
and bestows enough power cast Spells. If the Ring runs out of steam before
a Spell is cast, the Spell automatically taps into your energy supply
(you'll tire quickly). A metre on the ring shows how much power is left [0-
99]. The Ring is rechargeable (for a high price) at the Guild where you
received it.

%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#

SPELLS

Guild membership includes the chance to learn Spells. Guilds also offer
classes (you guessed it, there's a fee) on honing your Spell-casting
talents.

Guilds have a limited number of Spells they can teach. The Spells offered
depend on which Spells the Guild has and what your Character Level is.
Your Wisdom limits the number of Spells you can acquire (the maximum is
12).

Every Good Spell has an equivalent Evil Spell. Some Evil Spells are
slightly less powerful than Good Spells. Whether a Spell is Good or Evil
depends on the alignment of the Guild you learned it from.

When you Cast a Spell, there's no guarantee it will work! Spells you've
learned are listed in your Inventory, along with your likelihood of
successfully casting them (0%-95%). The more you successfully cast a
Spell, your _ability_ to use it increases (just as Strength improves with
fighting). Also, the better you know a Spell, the more likely it is to be
effective.

Different Spells need different amounts of energy. Once you've used up
your Ring's power, casting Spells makes you tired. If you're already
exhausted, your Hit Points are drained.

The following is an alphabetical list of Spells, their effects, and the
Guilds that teach them. An "*" indicates time-limited Spells; time limits
are in parentheses and are in AR time.

MAGIC

Magic consists of the four traditional Elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and
Water. Other factors come into play in making Magic work, but these are
the basics.

Experiment with magical Weapons and Armour to see which work best when
dealing with different creatures. When using Magic that isn't battle
related, pay close attention to everything that happens to you and keep an
eye on all your Stats; this is the best way to figure out what benefits
you're receiving from the Magic.

%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#

CURSES

Curses cause you to lose Stats or Hit Points (and, sometimes, to die),
depending on what you've been Cursed with. Example: A Curse of Clumsiness
causes you to lose Skill points.

There are two ways of being Cursed: picking up a Cursed item or being
Cursed by a dying enemy.

If you see the message CURSED! on the screen, but don't "act" cursed,
don't get cocky. Some Curses don't show effects up front. Get rid of
Curses before sleeping at The Retreat, since some Curse effects catch you
napping.

Any Guild you belong to removes Curses. Or you can use a Remove Curse
Scroll or hope to meet a Sage from your Guild who will agree to remove the
Curse.

Once a Curse is eliminated, you stop losing Stats or Hit Points. Some
cures even give you back all the points you lost (whew!).

%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#

POISON

Poison affects your stats permnamently or temporarily, depending on which
noxious substance you're unlucky enough to absorb. If you find a Potion
that cures Poison, drink it! Otherwise, find aWandering Healer right away.

There are two ways of being poisoned: swallowing poisonous Potions or
being mauled by poisonous creatures.

%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#

DISEASE

Contracting a Disease results in Hit Point and Stat loss in line with the
severity of the infection (some Diseases have an incubation period of
several days., Diseases can be fatal, although many simply run their
course (occasionally resulting in _permanent_ damage).

There are two usual ways to contract Disease: being showered by Mold
spores or being clawed or bitten by a Diseased creature.

If you get a Disease, drink a Potion that Cleanses, seek out a Wandering
Healer, or find the Fountain of Healing. If you're clawed or bitten in an
Encounter, find a Healer. He can prevent you from being infected.

There's a special case of Disease that only happens in the Crystal
Caverns. The walls there are sharp and jagged and one scratch can leave
you afflicted with the dreadful Crystal Doom. Its effects are gradual,
beginning with increased Strength and Stamina, but _decreased_ Hit Points
and Skill, until you finally turn to solid Crystal!

%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#

ENCOUNTERS

It's common to Encounter other life forms. Some areas of The Dungeon have
a higher probability of Encounters than others. Also, certain areas abound
in particular types of Encounters (e.g., Rats abound in The City Sewer).

Anytime you go through a Door you have a high chance of Encountering
something (slamming Doors alert Dungeon denizens to your presence!).

Three categories of Encounters are listed below, in the order most
favourable to you:

1. You surprise a life form;
2  You and a life form notice each other at the same time;
3. You are surprised by a life form.

Surprise
     If an Encounter begins with you being surprised by an opponent, he
     gets to make the first move. You have no options.

     If you do the surprising, you get four choices (the first two are
     Evil acts):

     1)   Waylay the creature: This means you conk the opponent on the
          head and try to make off wits his belongings.

     2)   Snatch something: Here, you try to grab the creature's treasure
          without getting involved in a battle.

     3)   None of these: This selection takes you straight to the regular
          Encounter Menu. (You still get to make the first move).

     0)   Leave: This is your best chance to escape from an undesired
          Encounter.

Encounter Menu
     In an Encounter, you're given several options (do nothing at all and
     you may be attacked). During battles, you have 4 (real time) seconds
     to choose an action. Switching Weapons use up part of this time, so
     quick reflexes are a must!

     Your options in an Encounter are:

     1)   Attack: You move offencively, while maintaining a decent
          defence.

     2)   Charge: This reckless move increases your chances of hurting the
          enemy, but also increases your likelihood of getting bashed. Be
          sure the Weapon you use is appropriate to the action (charging
          with a Bow is pointless).

     3)   Aimed Attack: This means you don't strike until the right,
          devastating instant. This move gives you a chance of inflicting
          a lot of damage while keeping up your guard.

     4)   Transact: Talk with a life form. The outcome depends on your
          Charm level, Moral Alignment, and how you've dealt with others
          in the past. This option opens up a plethora of possibilities
          for interaction with creatures.

          1) Offer  an item to a life form (gear the gift to the being
                    you've Encountered, but _don't_ feed the Ghouls). If
                    the creature accepts your offer, it may give you a
                    Clue or Rumour.

          2) Bluff  to talk your way out of a fight. This is neither a
                    Good nor Evil act.

          3) Trick  an opponent (if you're Intelligent enough). This Evil
                    act is a battle tactic to distract the creature's
                    attention long enough for you to get in the first
                    blow.

          4) Hail   the creature to start a conversation or find out who
                    it is. This is another way to be "nice" and, perhaps,
                    receive a Rumour or Clue. This is also the proper
                    beginning to any interchange with Wandering Healers.
                    If a life form attacks you when you Hail it,
                    retaliation is not an evil act.

          0) Leave  the Encounter. This isn't running away; it shows
                    you're just "not interested."

     5)   Switch Weapon: This choice exchanges Primary and Secondary
          Weapons.

     0)   Turn and Run: Sometimes, cowardice is the only solution. You
          actually turn around and go a different direction from the one
          you were facing during the Encounter. Note that you may become
          disoriented and end up in a different square than the one you
          had the Encounter in. Use your Compass or a Map Spell to get
          your bearings.

     During Encounters, you may also:

          C    Cast a Spell (if you know any);

          D    Drop an item;

          E    Examine Spells or items (check your Inventory);

          U    Use an item (you can't light a Torch or eat and drink
               during an Encounter);

          P    Pause the game (this suspends all time and activity - press
               any key to continue);

          Q    Quit the game without saving it.

     Tailor your Encounter strategy to fit your own physical and mental
     condition and the kind of life form confronting you. Don't expect to
     bluff or trick mindless life forms; you'd look pretty silly trying to
     bluff Mold!

%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#

LIFE FORMS

Many of the life forms found in The City also inhabit The Dungeon. The
Dungeon, however, is the home of other fantastic creatures that never see
daylight. As in The City, denizens of The Dungeon may be either Good or
Evil; the way you interact with them affects your alignment, so use
Wisdom.

The music accompanying the appearance of a life form gives you a clue to
its alignment: heavy, foreboding music indicates an evil being; lighter,
more cheerful sounds may mean the Encounter is of a friendlier nature.
Experience is the best way to learn if a creature is hostile.

Some monsters (such as Werewolves and Wraiths) can only be hurt by Magic
or Magic Weapons; although, sometimes a lit Torch can b effective in
driving them away (beware of creatures that are immune to fire!).

Below is a list of some of the beings you may Encounter in The Dungeons.

Paupers have no ambition or have met with some catastrophe that has put
     them in dire straits. Pathetic creatures, they can benefit from your
     generosity.

Guards police The Dungeon. Don't cross them! If you're being attacked by
     Guards, it probably means you've become evil or are a Thief.

Gladiators, Knights, and other fighters hang out in The Dungeon, looking
     for ways to hone their fighting skills

Noblemen live in the Palace and are fond of Arena games. They enter The
     Dungeon only to check activities that may affect their wealth and
     position back in The City.

Thieves, Cutthroats, Brigands, and Master Thieves skulk around The
     Dungeon, making their larcenous plans under cover of darkness.

Assassins strike swiftly, without warning. Try to avoid making enemies,
     since anyone who doesn't like you might send an Assassin your way!

Healers from The City often visit The Dungeon on errands of mercy or to do
     medical research. Meeting them is purely by chance, unless you find a
     Heirophant Card that lets you summon medical aid.

Mages, Wizards, and other magical types are associates of the Guilds.
     Acolytes, Novices, and Apprentices belong to this category.

Valkyries, the warrior maidens, are good life forms, but hostile to
     humans.

Dwarves love the gloom of The Dungeon and have a natural dislike of
     humans. They delve for precious metals and Gems and craft marvellous
     Weapons and Jewelry.

Serpentmen prowl the dank Dungeon corridors. These reptilian humanoids are
     Evil, so be on guard!

Trolts and Goblins are at war. Use caution in dealing with them; making
     friends with one group means automatic hostility from the other.

Gnomes, Orcs, and Gnolls scurry around The Dungeon corridors, planning
     unpleasant surprises for the unwary Adventurer.

Giant Rats and Wolves carry Rabies and love to share it by biting and
     clawing you.

Giant Bats attack from above. Sharp fangs and slashing claws make these
     "airy" creatures formidable foes.

Mould and Slime are found throughout The Dungeon, but especially in The
     City Sewer. Mold can leave you with horrible Diseases that are not
     easily cured. Slime fouls your food and its acid may eat away items
     lying on The Dungeon floor.

Storm Devils, Ice Demons, Flame Demos, Horned Devils, Imps, Gremlins, and
     Homunculi are dangerous, demonic denizens of the dark.

Pheoenix is a glorious firebird. The beating of its flaming wings stirs up
     hot winds all around. This is a good creature, though hostile to
     humans.

Dragons and Salamanders are really hot! Dragons are accomplished magicians
     and both creatures are fearsome, fire-breathing reptiles. They
     usually can't be defeated with ordinary Weapons, so use caution!

Whirlwinds are elemental spirits that challenge the skills of even the
     stoutest Adventurer. They scatter any items lying on The Dungeon
     floor.

Wraiths, Ghosts, Spectres, Zombies, Ghouls, Skeletons, Liches (Undead
     Wizards), and Vampires are the nightmarish horrors that haunt the
     Regions of the Undead.

Night Stalker is a legendary creature of The City that roams freely in The
     Dungeon. Although the Night Stalker isn't too formidable on the
     streets of The City, The Dungeon's darkness makes it incredibly
     powerful.

Devourer is a creature of myth. Few have ever Encountered this creature,
     and fewer still have survived to tell the tale.

EPILOGUE

The Dungeon is a game of discovery. You must explore every cavern and
crevice to find out about the Quests.

There is no right or wrong way to complete the game. Everything depends on
your Character's attributes and actions.

Once you've solved the major Quest (no small task!), the adventure doesn't
have to end. You've probably missed a Quest or two.

Or, try a completely different Character and play an entirely different
game strategy than you did the first time around.

The Dungeon holds many mysteries and it takes a stalwart Adventurer to
solve them all.

Greetings Fellow Travellers:

     I am Trilog. I was kidnapped from my home several years ago and left
in this alien place. I understand that I am one of the few who survived
the arduous encounters of The City of Xebec's Demise. Having gained
strength, wisdom, and courage there, I decided to venture into the dank
depths of the cavernous world beneath The City: The Dungeon.
     Though I made extensive plans before decending into the Dungeon, I
was not totally prepared for what befell me. As I write this, I have
already be faced with soul-shaking encounters, monsterous foes, and
unnatural perils. The lower I travel into the Dungeon's darkness, the more
alone I feel. Solitude weighs on me and Death dogs my heels; it lurks in
the shadows, waiting for me.
     Yet, I've come too far to quit now. Along with the danger comes the
strength from simply surviving; from hard fought adventures; from battles
won!
     I trust this map will be found by others like me. I cannot mark my
exact course of travel, I'm afraid, because there are evil enemies who
might also find this map and use it to hunt me down.
     There are several places on this map where you will be met with
baffling and fearsome quests. But don't lose heart! I've lived through
many of these and am confident that these quests will one day provide me
with the solution to my ultimate goal (and undoubtedly yours)... Escape
from Alternate Reality and the return to my beloved Earth! Good luck. And
If I have been fortunate, perhaps you and I will one day meet and share
stories of The Dungeon.

                                        Fare Thee Well,
                                        
                                        Trilog

{End of Documents}

Trilog's map is included as a separate file. Basic starting map is not
included. For your reference, it is a 64x64 map with the basic sewer and
the first well lighted area already marked, so you're not missing much.
You start the game facing West at location 60N,49E where the SW corner is
0N, 0E.
