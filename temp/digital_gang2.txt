Greetings fellow people and welcome to another session of Baging on the
gang!  These following text files were taken from the Specelite and
explaining the following boycott of Digital Gang and anyone that has a name
like Sherlock Apple and the only ones that no offense is intended for in DG
are Tom E. Hawk and The Dragonlord because they don't bother us or they dont
lie, back-stab, and skumbag us like the others do a 14 year old new wares kid
Eddie (AKA THE TRITON runs the new wares board called The Trade Center which
is the board we are boycotting) the other 2 reasons for the boycott are 1.
[The Sheik] AKA Chris "The Loser" because of his inability to crack and u
take credit for other peoples cracks (Like with neverending story, but that
shall be explained further on in these msgs) and of course everyones friend
Dave, Sherlock Apple

So sit back grab a beer and read on this is only part [1] and there will be
more to follow this one there are already 15 or 16 msgs in this file and the
boycott was only started 12 hours ago!

     This is an official document for al the users of the SpecElite:

As of July 10, 1986 - 8:19 PM, all membrs of the SpecElite are requested to
BOYCOTT the Trade Center!  The sysop (ak.a.-- Nu warezzz kid, or big-time
l0zer) is Eddie/The Triton.  I know som of you don't even call...but just
support the boycott anyways.

Reasons:  Eddie/Triton's board is such  l0ser board (warezzzwarezzzwarezzz).
Also, what he did to Kam/The Cloak.  Hecalled kam to log on to his board and
then asked him to post.  So kam out of ourtesy posted...but Kam asked eddie
if he could get Locksmith 6.0 docs...afterkam posted, Eddie hung up on Kam.
Kam was naturally upset and now supports ths boycott happily.  The major
reason I support this boycott is for what he, an Sherlock Apple did on the
Trade Center.  Both ragged on OGRE (Just becase they were jealous that The
Talisman, Dr. Fate, I and Parity Error released ORE BEFORE they did).  So
they came up with every excuse in the book trying o convince everyone NOT TO
GET the ware!  They said stuff like.."it's onlya half disk" "graphics suck",
etc...etc.. you get the picture.  Sherlock Aple and The Triton have done many
things such as the above to many other cool peple.  We (Parity Error, The
Cloak and I) think that a BOYCOTT would serve the right.  Please support it
and we would like to hear from ya.

SUPPORTERS:

Parity Error/LSD, The Doc/EA, The Cloak/Black Bag, The Talisman/First Class,
The Exorcist/EA.

If you can please post anything that Sherlock apple has done or The Triton
that has upset you, it would be appreciated. Also, POST or leave me MAIL that
you support this boycott...so we expect to ear from EVERYONE.  Thank you for
your kind support.

I admit Eddie has been getting off prety bad lately..

If you need another reason to boycott Edie, he's had 10 of my mac/amiga
disks that I sent him with warez on the for at least a month. Every time
I tell him to send them back, he gives ome BS and says he has to go.
He sure is turning into a loser..

Ol' Sherlock buddy pulled one over myu
ake that my face the other week..
Remember Intracourse?  Well, I was the
distributer.  Yeah, he called me and
said some BS about "Hey all the distri-
butors are out of town, and we need you
to distribute this RAD ware."  So I
did.  Mistake.  He said all this about
how he was going to call me back etc.
but I haven't heard from him since.
Sounds like I got the wool pulled over
my eyes.

     About 2 months ago, when someone ws releasing all of those rag wares on
Digital Gang (Space Adventure, Star War), he called my house and blamed it on
me!  I barely ever talked to Eddie, so  was trying to figure out why the hell
he blamed it on me.  He also blamed it n Crazy Cat, when he has >NEVER<
talked to him or did anything to him in his whle life.  And I will be glad to
boycott the trade center.  The name of his boar gives you an idea of how
shitty it is.
So Glenn, you got me in there too.

 Well, I know I've never logged onto
the trade center.. Mainly because I
know enough about most of the people
who hang around in that group..

 The Triton, of course, is the ultimate
ew wares kid.. he's fucked around with
me too many times to tell.. I just
ignore him now..

 Sherlock Apple: Old pirate. so he's
cool, right? yep, even ask him... He's
he biggest weasle I've ever talked to
in my life.. he takes advantage of
things.. Like he knows that First Class
oesn't put wares out if we know
someone else did first, mainly out of
courtesy, so he'll lie about when
things are cracked, and be a scumbag.
He'll even talk to you on the phone
till they're done cracking it so that
you can't be doing it.. or he'll leave
ou on call waiting for a year or two.
The main thing that bugs me is that he
on't rag to your face. he'll tell
someone else to tell you, then deny it
hen you call him.. he's definetly a
weasel, I have many stories about him
too.. I ignore him too, and that just
about solves my problem.

 The Sheik: Many things to say.. but
the most recent. He called me up with
Neverending story, and wanted my help
cracking it.. [cont]

anyways, he wanted me to help him crack
everending Story..

 He couldn't convert it, but had
figured out the headers.. I told him
what bytes, etc, to do, and converted
the disk for him.. then I got their
loader working.. the whole loader was
encoded (everything was ROL'd I think
or maybe ROR'd).. anyways, I figured
out the bytes to search for, and told
him what to change them to.  Then he
found one protection scheme (I told him
here to look), and took it out. The
next one he couldn't figure out really,
o he sent me that portion of memory,
and I found that it was just looking
for Volume 34 or some weird volume,
which could easily be changed to a 00
and would solve the problem.. (their
loader wasn't a DOS one, don't get any
trange ideas, but it DID check for
volume).. anyways, it then booted and
worked, but the text was garbled..

 this all took about a full day. why?
was it a hard crack? No.. He refused to
end me the ware.. I didn't really know
why then, he kept making excuses, but
obviously it was because he wanted all
he credit. so I was doing all this
without looking at any code.. and when
t didn't work perfect, he still
refused to send it to me... so I told
him that I couldn't help him anymore,
because I couldn't see it.  It took him
bout 6 days after that to figure it
out and get the ware out..

 but after the 6 days, he actually DID
et it working.... I don't know how,
because I don't know what he was
doing.. I KNOW he was working the whole
ime.. I strongly believe that either:

 1) he messed up that one part he did

 or

 2) he forgot to copy some tracks, or
something equally stupid and lame..

 in any case, I know for sure that the
heik is NOT what I'd call a cracker..
He can convert ok, and his main ability
s his patience.. he'll go through the
disk and try every possible combination
f "EA"s on every track till it works..
he couldn't tell what a protection
routine was doing if it was in source
code... I've heard rumors that there's
omeone who lives near him that helps
him crack, and of course gets no
credit.. I know I got no credit on
Neverending Story.(It doesn't matter
that much, but as long as we're telling
tories)..

 Dragon Lord: Very stuck up about his
abilities on cracking.. BUT, he's an
overall ok guy by me.. he's at least
not a little 13 year old lying new
wares kid..

 The Bit is definetly cool.

is their only real talented member and
 can respect him for:

 1) I know he is a better than decent
cracker

 2) I know he is a pretty good
programmer too

 3) He keeps a low profile, doesn't use
is modem too much, and doesn't make
enemies..

 I don't know him, but he's all right

Well,

     I guess I have to add my $3.68
worth on this warmed-over delegation(I
inda like that word..owell)

     Sherlock is in my opinion kinda a
wo-faced grease ball of a wares
kid...but I guess I should make him
look good.  He's sorta like the kid you
ll know who when one person is worth
befriending....that's who he hangs
around and the next minute when someone
etter comes around he chops his old
"friend" in the back.  This is getting
 little bit like Personality

Throw my 2 cents worth in.. ONly thing  can remember about
the sheik was when I talked to him abou cracking some football
game (Joe theisman or World's greatest,I don't remember)
     
I say "Was the disk DOS formatted or wa it a loader?"
Sheik-"uhhhh, I don't know, I just craced it"
I say "well, does it have a catalog anyhere?"
Sheik-"Don't ask me stupid questions, Ijust got the old Transylvania
       crack out of Hardcore and it wored"
(The transylvania crack consists of B947Mm:18, then run FID)

So I get the ware from him.. It doesnt ork. Maybe a bad transfer?
I'll never know.. he did wait about 2 hurs before sending it to
anyone else.. And yes, the disk was comletely 3.3, just like
Transylvania

We in Lsd have had several problems
with the digital gang and Sherlock
Shithead about our last four
(decent) wares. 

The first problem was with a Trivia
game called Mind Pursuit. We put
it out two weeks before they did,
and i received mail from sherlock
apple telling me that I was a loser
for being in a group that puts
wares out after they did! They
deleted our copy off of trade center
(which had been there for two weeks)
and replaced it with theirs!

The second problem was with Murder
on the Mississippi. We did not keep
it a secret that we were working on it
and sherlock apple called the 
sysop of apple tree so he would keep
the ae line down, until they finished
their copy! Needless to say, since
they had the first copy on apple
tree, they claimed to be the first
to put it out, and ragged on us!

The next problem is with trinity.
One of our members had a big mouth
and told eddie that we were working
on it. The Sheik and The triton
called back later and told him that
they were done with it and would
send it in 30 minutes. Two weeks
later, it was still not out. Out of
courtesy, we stopped working on it
when we were told that it was out.
cont next msg..

The final problem we have had with
them, regard Ogre. They were pissed
off that both Lsd and First Class
burned them on it. They bought it
and could not krack it quickly
(I cannot understand why this
could be true, but they did not
krack it in time, so they were
burned by days). They were pissed
that they payed $40 for nothing, and
posted all over Trade Center th`d
it was a ware not worth getting,
and that it took up only half of
a disk, so it could not be good.
They claimed that it takes 3-4
hours per game, and is too slow.
When I pointed out that there
were only 8 free blocks, that the
game takes only 30 minutes (I won in
half an hour) and that it is faster
than other strategy games and has
pull down menus, I received an
apology. Then, they deleted all
of my and other lsd members messages
regarding the incident, and left
theirs!

So as you can see, we have a long list
of grievances, that go much farther
than these incidents. I like Ron,
and Larry (when he was in), but
Dave is a jerk, and Eddie is a
moron. I do not know the Sheik, but
I know that he is an asshole too.

These are my opinions, but I tend
to think that I speak for my group too.

Eddie--The Triton is a major loser in
my book.  When he was a member of
FC(which was the biggest mistake in MY
ifetime) he was really a MAJOR loser.
I knew Eddie when he first started out
nd when he used to change his name
about 4 times a week...well, after
these years..he hasn't change his name
n a while but he still the BIGGEST
pirate loser i've ever known...if you
ask me, I think he is the ULTIMATE New
Kid ever...anyway, gotta go..what a
shitty connection...I support the
BOYCOT.

Then he goes as far as to tell me to

Hmm, Oh yeah.. Eddie is a fucking
