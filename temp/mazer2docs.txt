Playing Mazer 2

Move around in 'virtual reality' world via mouse;  interact
 via four kinds of "Energy Pulses": Creative, Destructive,
 Affirmative, Negative (CRT, DST, AFF, NEG).  

CRT- Creates, restores / friendly
DST- Destroys, attacks / hostile
AFF- says "Yes"
NEG- says "No"

To fire a pulse, hold down mouse button and select one of the
 symbols at the corners of the message area below the main
 view. When you release the mouse button after selecting a
 pulse type, that type of energy is released in the direction
 you are facing.  Clicking fires energy pulse of type last
 selected. Releasing button in blank area between symbols
 does NOT fire a pulse. (Also: Clicking in this area is
 signal that any current message has been read and you are
 ready to continue.)

Status Bars:  Left bar = Overall Energy level (HP, health, etc.)
	        Right bar = Temp Energy level (energy available to
              fire pulses)

ESC key: Pauses Game; allows Save/Restore up to four
 Games (#1-#4) and/or Quit

? system error 0201: "out of memory" --> may try booting
 bare-bones GSOS from disk

Goal/Objectives: must determine for yourself

Accelerator boards: game is a bit too fast on Zip-GS 9MHz;
 probably, it's a good idea to reduce speed setting.

Mouse moving: inconvenient to have to pick up and move
 mouse to move; would be better to use button for 'move
 in current direction' and use SPC to fire pulses.

Sound: no sound!
