         THE WISSENSCHAFTSLADEN HANNOVER e.V.

     In the 80th in Germany many of  the  critical  scientists
were unsatisfied  with  the  framework of their own scientific
work at universities and research  institutions,  mainly  with
the ever  growing  distance  of  scientific  knowledge and the
needs of everyday life.  Because of this some  of  thesepeople
fouded a  non-university  institution,  that was situated just
within this gap between science and daily life. The aim was to
confront the  scientific  communitu  with the needs of society
and to bring (back) social and  ecological  responsibility  to
the university.
     The Wissenschaftsladen Hannover e.V. was founded in 1986.
Because of  the nuclear accident in the Soviat Union that year
one of the first main topics of work were  informations  about
nuclear technology and radioactivity.  Lucky enough there were
not only scientists but academics,  pedagogues  and  other  as
well. From  the  beginning  there was the intention to work in
interdisciplinary teams.
     Today the  Wissenschaftsladen Hannover e.V.  has about 30
permanent members and several corresponding  members.  It's  a
registered society  and  financed by membership subscriptions,
donations, expert-opinions and several projects.  The honorary
members and   the  employees  of  the  Wissenschaftsladen  are
working on several different topics in the sphere  of  ecology
and environmental      protection.     Remaining     constant,
Wissenschaftsladen aims can still be described as follows:
     science for the benefit of the public and
     science for the benefit of the environment.

             (to be concluded in next issue)
