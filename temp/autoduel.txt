|     This is just a short summary of commands and a description of things in |
|  Autoduel for those of you who have never played Car Wars or Autoduel Cham- |
|  pions.  The game is in a futuristic setting where society fell because  of |
|  food shortages and became very barbarianistic.  Many towns  and cities be- |
|  came fortresses and the motorcycle gangs ruled the countryside. Death spo- |
|  rts became popular and autoduelling started when "Crazy Joe" Harshman  won |
|  a destruction derby by mounting a .50 cal machinegun on his car.  In  res- |
|  ponse to the increase of cycle  gangs  and  their  sophisticated  weaponry |
|  many citizens arm themselves. Police are no longer able to deal with armed |
|  vehicles and informal highway duels increase....                           |
|                                                                             |
|     In Autoduel, the object of the game is to have fun killing other people |
|  and plundering their possessions. When you first start out, you have $2000 |
|  and 50 skill points. Be sure to buy body armor at the  truck  stop  before |
|  anything else. In this game, anything hit by gunfire or ramming is partia- |
|  lly destroyed. DP is how many "hits" something will take before it is tot- |
|  ally gone. So when you buy body armor, you actually double the  number  of |
|  hits you may take.  At first, all you can do is to try to earn  some money |
|  by going to the Arena for Amateur's Night. There you get a car on loan and |
|  fight with other amateur's for a cash prize.  You can only do this if  you |
|  are poor and low in reputation. You can gain money by winning tournaments, |
|  delivering items, selling items, etc, and prestige by being victorious,  a |
|  dependable courier, or a merciless vigilante. Otherwise if you get  frust- |
|  rated and can't get anywhere, track $1A sector $00  has all your character |
|  information - $14-$16 is money and $17-$19 your skills.                    |
|                                                                             |
|     If you make a "kill" you may salvage your victim's items, if he has any |
|  by getting out of your car "G" and moving over it. If there is anything to |
|  be found, take it back to your car (if you have enough room and weight) to |
|  sell it at the salvage shop. Some other commands - CTRL T gives you a list |
|  of all cargo carried and which car is carrying it (you can have eight cars |
|  if you want to) CTRL C gives you the status of your car, CTRL D status  of |
|  yourself, CTRL L for location and time, and Q to save the game.            |
|                                                                             |
