PARAMETER DEFINITIONS
--------- -----------
SOURCE SLOT:      RANGE: 1-7  DEFAULT: 
6

SOURCE DRIVE:     RANGE: 1-2  DEFAULT: 
1
     
TARGET SLOT:      SAME AS SOURCE EXCEPT
 TARGET DISK

TRACK PHASE:      RANGE: 0-2  DEFAULT:0
      DEFINITION: WHEN SET TO 0 ECHO ON
LY READS WHOLE TRACKS.
                  WHEN SET TO 1 ECHO RE
ADS HALF TRACKS.
                  WHEN SET TO 2 (SEE SP
ECIAL FEATURES) ECHO TRIES TO
                    FIGURE OUT WHAT TO 
READ.
 
TRACK START:      RANGE: 0-23  DEFAULT:
 00
      DEFINITION: FIRST TRACK THAT ECHO
 WILL COPY.

TRACK END:        RANGE: 0-23  DEFAULT:
 22
      DEFINITION: LAST TRACK THAT ECHO 
WILL COPY.

TRACK COUNT:      RANGE: 1-23  DEFAULT:
 1
      DEFINITION: NUMBER TO INCREMENT B
Y
      EXAMPLE: TRACK 1-12  TRACK COUNT:
3
               COPY: 1-4-7-10 ETC.

ENABLE SYNC:      RANGE: 0-1  DEFAULT:

UNTING IS SELECTED.
                  (SEE SPECIAL FEATURES
)

FRAME BITS:      RANGE: 0-2  DEFAULT: 1
     DEFINITION: THE NUMBER OF '0' BITS
 ECHO WILL WRITE AFTER
                   EACH SYNC BYTE.  IF 
'0' IS SELECTED ECHO ENABLES

ECHO'S MESSAGES
------ --------
IN THE LOWER RIGHT HAND BOX WHEN COPYIN
G YOU WILL SEE SOMETHING IN A
  FORMAT LIKE THIS:
                          TT SSSS LLLL 
      E
    TT   = TRACK NUMBER
    SSSS = NUMBER OF SYNC BYTES ON THE 
TRACK
    LLLL = LENGTH OF THE TRACK
    E    = ERROR CODE

THE TWO LONG BOXES ON THE RIGHT HAND SI
DE ARE THE TRACK INFORMATION
  FIELDS.  IN THEM YOU WILL SEE SOMTHIN
G LIKE THIS:
                           TT  +NN
                             OR
                           TT  -NN
TT = TRACK #   NN = DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
SOURCE AND TARGET INFORMATION.

IN THE PHASE FINDER MODE, THE TWO BOXES
 WILL FORMAT LIKE THIS:
                           TT  N
TT = TRACK #   N  = WHOLE TRACK IF IT'S
 A 0, HALF TRACK IF IT'S A 1


ERROR CODES
----- -----
ERROR 0:  ECHO HAD NO PROBLEM COPYING T
HIS TRACK
ERROR 1:  ECHO COULDN'T DETERMINE LENGT
H OF TRACK WHEN IT WAS READ.
          > THIS ERROR IS FATAL.  IF YO
U GET IT TRY AGAIN AND HOPE!

ERROR 3:  IF YOU GET THIS ERROR YOU BET
TER GET ANOTHER COPY OF ECHO

D
ERROR 5   ECHO COULD NOT VERIFY THE TRA
CK THAT IT WROTE. THE TRACK
            MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN CO
PIED SUCCESSFULLY.
ERROR 6   TRACK LENGTH IS DIFFERENT THE

            ONLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU USE E
NABLE COUNT.  ECHO WILL

 UNTIL THE LENGTHS ARE THE
            SAME.
ERROR 7:  ECHO COULDN'T SYNC THE TRACK.


SPECIAL FEATURES
------- --------
PHASE FINDER
   DEFINITION: DISPLAYS A 0 IF IT'S A W
HOLE TRACK AND A 1 IF IT'S A
   HALF. THIS IS ONLY A STATISTICAL E
VALUATION AND MAY BE UNRELIABLE.
SYNC MODE
   DEFINITION: SYNCS THE DISK. IF YOU G
ET EITHER AN ERROR 2 OR AN

TRY NOT TO NIBBLE COUNT UNLESS
   ALL ELSE FAILS.
LENGTH KILL
   DEFINITION: IF THE FRAME BITS PARA
METER IS SET TO 0 THEN THE
