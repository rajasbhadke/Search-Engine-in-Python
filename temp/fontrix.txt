BOOT-UP
=======

FIRST, CONFIGURE YOUR FONTRIX DISK FOR YOUR COMPUTER AND PRINTER.


MAKING A GRAFILE
=================

WHAT IS A GRAFILE? A GRAFILE IS A BINARY FILE WHICH HOLDS ALL OF THE
EXTENDED SCREENS THAT YOU WILL BE WRITING ON. THE GRAFILE MUST BE
MADE BEFORE YOU START WRITING ON THE SCREEN. ONCE MADE, THE GRAFILE
RECORDS INFORMATION EACH TIME YOU GO OFF THE SCREEN YOU ARE DRAWING
ON AND THEN GIVES YOU MORE ROOM, UNTIL YOU ARE OUT OF IT.

FIRST, CHOOSE THE "G" COMMAND FROM THE MAIN MENU AND GO TO THE
GRAPHIC WRITER SECTON. ONCE THERE, YOU SHOULD LOAD YOUR FONT THAT
YOU WISH TO USE ON THE GRAFILE. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT FONT YOU WANT
TO USE, JUST HIT THE "D" COMMAND AND CATALOG THE DISK. ONCE YOU'VE
FOUND THE FONT YOU WANT TO LOAD, JUST LOAD IT BY HITTING THE "F"
COMMAND AND TYPE IN THE FILE NAME, WITHOUT THE "SET" PART, IT LOADS
THAT AUTOMATICALLY.

NEXT, YOU NEED TO OPEN THE GRAFILE. DEPENDING ON THE SIZE YOU WISH
TO OPEN IT AS, YOU WILL NEED, ROOM ON ANOTHER DISK FOR IT. IT'S A
GOOD IDEA TO HAVE 1 DISK COMPLETELY FOR GRAFILES. ANYWAYS, CHOOSE
DTHE "O" COMMAND AND ENTER THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SECTORS (A
TABLE FOR DIFFERENT SECTORS ARE AT THE END OF THIS SECTION). THE DISK
WILL WHIR FOR A WHILE AND THEN, THE GRAFILE WILL BE MADE.

NEXT, CHOOSE THE "W" COMMAND AND MAKE SURE THE GRAFILE DISK IS IN THE
DRIVE. YOU WILL NOW BE PROMPTED IN FRONT OF A BUNCH OF COMMANDS,
THESE ARE THE HELP COMMANDS, AND CAN BE DISPLAYED AT ANYTIME BY
HITTING <CTRL-A>. NOW YOU CAN TYPE WHATEVER YOU WANT, AND WHEN YOU
ARE READY TO CLOSE THE GRAFILE, JUST TYPE <CTRL-Q> AND THEN YOU
WILL BE BACK AT THE MENU.

NOW, TYPE "C" FOR CLOSE AND THE GRAFILE WILL BE CLOSED. YOU CAN NOW
GO TO THE DUMP SECTION AND PRINT OUT YOUR GRAFILE. IN THAT SECTION
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS INPUT THE NAME OF THE GRAFILE AND THEN JUST
MAKE SURE YOUR PRINTER IS ON.


HORIZONTAL & VERTICAL SECTORS
=============================

NOTES ABOUT GRAPHICS
====================

ONE VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF FONTRIX IS THE ABILITY TO PRINT GRAPHICS
ALONG WITH YOUR GRAFILE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO NOT
ONLY WRITE WORDS AND PRINT THEM OUT; YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO INCLUDE
PICTURES ALONG WITH THE WORDS. WELL, FONTRIX CAN DO THIS. THERE IS
THIS THING CALLED A GRAPHIC; WHICH IS JUST A FANCY WORD FOR A HI-RES
PICTURE (YOU KNOW, THE KIND YOU SAVE AT $2000 AND $2000). IF YOU HAVE
A SPECIFIC PICTURE THAT YOU WANT TO LOAD, JUST USE THE COMMAND THAT
LOADS THE GRAPHIC, AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ALREADY POSITIONED
IN YOUR GRAFILE (WHICH SHOULD ALREADY BE OPEN AND READY) SO THAT
WHEN THE PICTURE IS LOADED, IT WILL LOAD INTO THE SPOT IN YOUR
GRAFILE THAT YOU WANT IT TO. THIS WAY YOU COULD LOAD ABOUT 16 SCREENS
ACCROSS AND ABOUT THE SAME DOWN WORTH OF GRAPHIC PICTURES AND PRINT
THEM ALL OUT AT THE SAME TIME! THIS SPECIAL FEATURE CAN BE VERY
USEFUL ONCE YOU FIND THE USE.
