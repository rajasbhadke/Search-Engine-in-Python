Introduction:
=============

     After seeing the new transfer programs that were being developed for the
purpose of improving and replacing Cat-Fur 2.2a, I decided to rewrite Cat-Fur
in order to improve it and maintain compatibility. This new version of Cat-Fur
is 100% compatible with the existing Cat-Fur 2.2a, fixed by The Ubiquitous
Hacker. It also uses 64k Diversi-Dos 4.1C and this must be loaded in order to 
use the new version. There is no memory available for any more additions to the 
program. At the last count there were about 30 bytes of free memory. This file 
will first give an overview of all the new modifications and then go into the 
specifics into each of the modifications.

NOTE: This Cat-Fur fully supports the Enhanced //e as well as any other
      Apple // computer with 64k. (Even the IIGS in SLOW speed).

Terminal mods:
==============

     Lightbar menus:
     ===============
                 Lightbar menus can take input by:
                 ---------------------------------
                 1) Typing the character between the brackets on the menu.
                 2) Using arrows (either left/right or up/down) to move
                    lightbar to your choice then pressing Return to choose
                    option.
                 3) Using joystick to scroll lightbar to choice then pressing
                    either joystick button to select option.

                 In Terminal Mode, not all of the lightbars are displayed
                 at once, and to get to the other options it is necessary
                 to scroll off of the top or bottom of the screen, and
                 the lightbars will scroll as well.

                    NOTE: The joystick method is optional and can be set in the
                          reconfigure menu. If you do not have a joystick,
                          do not worry as it automatically disables itself.

     Dialing Options:
     ================
                 The dialing delays have been greatly shortened as well
                 as the wait delay, if you experience any problems as a
                 result, simply use the ":" as a pause. To "Auto-connect"
                 to a board, simply Number:A, and it will Auto-Search.

                 NOTE: To Auto-Search upon loading simply issue a
                 POKE 836,102 before running it.

     Buffer Options:
     ===============
                 Specs on the buffer:
                 --------------------
                 The 21000 character buffer is located between $900 and $5BA0.
                 This translates to 84 sectors and the amount of free
                 characters is displayed in the upper right corner. The buffer
                 status light (on/off) is kept at the top of the screen. The
                 buffer can be toggled in one of two ways:

                 1) Going into the terminal section and toggling the buffer.
                 2) Toggling it while online by hitting control-B.

                 If you have an extended 80 column card, the buffer will be
                 copied into auxiliary memory when you enter the transfer
                 section and copied back to main memory when you exit the
                 transfer section.

                 If you do NOT have an extended 80 column card then you will be
                 prompted if you haven't saved the buffer yet.

                 When the buffer gets full you will be prompted in the upper
                 right corner.

                 Viewing the buffer:
                 -------------------
                 When you choose to view the buffer you will be asked which
                 slot you want it sent to. This serves three purposes:

                 1) Send the buffer to the printer slot to have it printed.
                 2) Send the buffer to your 80 column card to view it in 80
                    columns.
                 3) Hit return and view it in 40 columns.

                 While viewing the buffer you can hit any key to pause the
                 listing or hit either return or escape to abort the listing.

                 Saving the buffer:
                 ------------------
                 To save the buffer simply select the option to save it on the
                 terminal menu. After saving the buffer, it will automatically
                 be cleared.

                 Reading a file into the buffer:
                 -------------------------------
                 To read the buffer simply select the option to read it on the
                 terminal menu. It will read in as much of the text file as
                 possible. It will also prompt you if there is already
                 something in the buffer. You can then either clear the buffer
                 first or append to the buffer.

                 Clearing the buffer:
                 --------------------
                 Simply select this option on the terminal menu where you will
                 then be prompted if you are sure you want to clear the buffer.

                 Transmitting the buffer:
                 ------------------------
                 When you select to transmit the buffer you will be asked to
                 set the delay after each return. The default is 1 which should
                 be a sufficient delay. If it is not then simply set it to what
                 you feel will be. When you transmit the buffer Cat-Fur sends
                 the current buffer. While it is being sent you can hit any key
                 to pause or hit either return or escape to stop transmission.

     Reconfigure menu:
     =================
                 New reconfigure options:
                 ------------------------
                 1) Disable sound completely.
                 2) Sound alarm upon connection.
                 3) Volume lockout if you selected that you had a hard drive.
                 4) Optional @ACC files if you feel they are unnecessary.
                 5) @ACTION file selection [SEE BELOW].
                 6) Copy buffer to auxiliary memory when entering transfer
                    section.
                 7) Amount of transfers allowed per call.
                 8) Return to BBS from remote.
                 9) Select amount of time the user has in remote, if you have a
                    Thunderclock.

                 Upon Saving the updated Cat-Fur to disk, it will save
                 under the name of CAT-FUR to the default slot, drive,
                 and volume. (A$6000,L$5DC2)

                 NOTE: The Lockout all other slots, and drives is a very useful
                 feature for users who have only one drive, or for hard drive
                 users. This feature does not allow the online user to change
                 the slot or drive in anyway, in this way the user will only
                 be allowed to access different volumes.

                 @ACTION file
                 ------------
                 This file contains the users transferring status which is
                 stored on the default volume you selected in the reconfigure
                 menu. It opens and appends to the file. It writes in the
                 following format:

                 Uxxx or Dxxx [where "xxx" is the number of sectors of the
                               file]
                 Vxxx         [where "xxx" is the volume of the file]
                 Filename of the file which was transferred
                 Uxxx or Dxxx [same as above]
                 Vxxx         [same as above]
                 Filename     [same as above]
                 etc...

                 This should be very useful for boards which keep track of user
                 transferring status and have to scan every volume to see
                 whether or not something was uploaded.

                 NOTE: This option is only active if CF 2.2a Enh. is being
                 run Remotely (from a board). The @ACTION file will be
                 written to the slot, drive, and volume of which CF 2.2a
                 Enh. was run from.

                 Maintaining text page:
                 ----------------------
                 As in BME, Cat-Fur 2.2a Enhanced will copy the current text
                 page in a buffer when you hit control-Q to enter terminal mode
                 so that when you re-enter term you will be at the same
                 location that you were in before.

                 NOTE: When you are off-line (connected but in Terminal mode),
                 NO incoming characters are displayed or intercepted, so
                 make sure when you do enter Terminal mode (via ^Q) you should
                 be at the main menu of a board, or some other place where
                 it does not change between 103/202.

                 Exiting from Cat-Fur 2.2a Enhanced:
                 ------------------------------------
                 Upon exiting from CF 2.2a Enh. (via ESCAPE or ^C or RESET),
                 DOS is restored as much as possible to as it was before.
                 To re-enter CF 2.2a Enh. after exiting press & from BASIC,
                 or ^Y from MONITOR.

Unattended mods:
================
                 Enhanced chat mode:
                 -------------------
                 Previously in the older versions of Cat-Fur, chat was entered
                 with a control-Q. With the new Enhanced chat mode, control-B
                 enters chat and control-F exits chat. There is no longer a
                 need for the receiving person to enter K)hat mode as there is
                 now an auto-echo feature which echoes every character to the
                 receiving end.

                 Return to BBS option:
                 ---------------------
                 When a user selects "Return to BBS" from remote Cat-Fur will
                 then run "@FUR" but, to determine that they are returning to
                 the BBS a check must be added. PEEK (2046) will yield a 255 if
                 the user is returning to the BBS. Otherwise it will hold their
                 level as before. This is optional and can be selected from the
                 reconfigure menu, and is only active when being run remotely.

                 NOTE: See @FUR note at end of file.

                 Online Clock:
                 -------------
                 The Vulture's clock feature is now directly installed into
                 Cat-Fur. This feature is set in reconfigure and is optional.

                 NOTE: This option is only active if a Thunderclock is present
                 in any slot from 1-7, CF 2.2a Enh. will automatically find
                 the clock.

                 Online Transferring Status:
                 ---------------------------
                 O)nline transferring status tells the user their current
                 upload/download ratios along with the total numbers of
                 transfers this call and transfers remaining (if not
                 unlimited). There is also a visible counter for the sysops
                 next to the incoming and outgoing character windows at the top
                 of the screen. This counts the number of files transferred,
                 not the total number of transfers.

                 Auto-pause:
                 -----------
                 This feature is used when viewing text files. It will
                 automatically pause when the screen is filled with characters,
                 not after every 18 returns. It will work when viewing ANY text
                 file whether 40, 80, or any other format. This feature is
                 useful when you wish to read text files online, but it is not
                 useful when you want to capture it in your buffer, therefore
                 it can be toggled on or off in remote via "A".

                 +/- or arrows to log volumes:
                 -----------------------------
                 You may now use your arrow keys (left/right or up/down) as
                 well as +/- keys to move up or down volumes on the hard drive.

                 NOTE: This option is only active if a hard drive is in use.

                 Online 12800 character message editor:
                 --------------------------------------
                 This is an online message editor. Although it is not a full
                 scale message editor, it is useful for "About files" as well
                 as messages to the sysop.

                 NOTE: All commands that are listed as "^A ^A:Abort.." mean
                 that Control-A must be pressed twice consecutively in order
                 to issue that command. It would also be helpful if you
                 ended every line with a RETURN, as many times it will
                 repeat your last line that you typed in, that is from
                 the last RETURN to the end of the message.

                 Chat Call:
                 ----------
                 This feature is meant to call the sysops attention when the
                 online user needs assistance. It sounds a short tone three
                 times, after that no noise is made. Once selected it shows a
                 flashing "CHAT!" in the upper right corner. It can be
                 turned off by the user online as well as by chatting with the
                 user.

                 Full DOS support for Sysops:
                 ----------------------------
                 Sysops can now log volumes or interpret DOS commands from
                 terminal mode as well as when in transfer mode.

                 Search for a File on Hard Drive:
                 --------------------------------
                 This feature will search the hard drive for a file which you
                 select by typing the first few letters. It will start the scan
                 from the lowest lockout volume up to the highest. The
                 volume(s) that the file was found on (if any) will be
                 displayed and it will put the user on the last found volume.

                 NOTE: This option is only active if a hard drive is in use.

                 Free Sector Scan:
                 -----------------
                 This feature will search the hard drive for a selected number
                 of sectors that the user online chooses. The user will then be
                 taken to the first volume found with enough room. If there is
                 no room anywhere on the hard drive the user will be prompted.

                 NOTE: This option is only active if a hard drive is in use.

                 Loop routine:
                 ------------
                 If a key is not hit in unattended after approximately 
                 two minutes, CF 2.2a Enh. will hang up. Two ^G BEEPS are sent
                 to the other side about 30 seconds before hanging up.

                 Counts number of selected sectors:
                 ----------------------------------
                 This feature shows the total number of selected sectors
                 on the bottom right of the text window, after a CATALOG
                 is sent or received. It keeps an running count of the number
                 of sectors the transfer will be.

                 Extended filetypes:
                 -------------------
                 Filetypes are now shown as: TXT, INT, APL, BIN, SEQ, REL, AUX,
                 and LSA. The files sectors are also corrected, in other words
                 it will now show the correct number of sectors a file is, if
                 it exceeds the standard 256.

Peeks, Pokes, & Calls:
======================

                 Pokes for Cat-Fur 2.2a Enhanced Remote:
                 ---------------------------------------
                 All of the following pokes should be issues AFTER
                 CF 2.2a Enh. has been BLOADed into memory, and none
                 of the pokes should be less than 0 or greater than 255.

                 Set number of chat calls [default=3]: POKE 26097,number

                 Set starting slot, drive, and volume: POKE 26229,slot :
                 POKE 26221,drive : POKE 26237,volume

                 Upload only Cat-Fur 2.2a Enh.: POKE 36757,76 :
                 POKE 36758,125 : POKE 36759,139

                 Disable free sector print out in remote: POKE 44164,96

                 Set minutes allowed in remote: POKE 48423,minutes

                 Disable sound completely: POKE 48430,0

                 Set low/high volumes: POKE 48443,low : POKE 48444,high

                 Set number of transfers: POKE 48445,number

                 To start CF 2.2a Enh. after it has been BLOADed and
                 POKEd, issue a: CALL 24576

                 Peeks AFTER Cat-Fur 2.2a Enhanced has been run:
                 -----------------------------------------------
                 PEEK (898) = number of uploaded files
                 PEEK (899) = number of downloaded files
                 PEEK (900) = number of uploads total
                 PEEK (901) = number of downloads total
                 PEEK (2046) = 255, Returning to BBS
                 PEEK (2046) <> 255, not returning to BBS, lost carrier

                 @FUR and other notes:
                 ---------------------
                 The hello text-file is still CAT.HELLO, and the file run
                 upon losing carrier, or Returning to the BBS is @FUR.
                 The only difference with @FUR is that now @FUR must
                 have a line 1. For example enter this:

                 1 REM NOW THERE'S A LINE 1!!

                 And @FUR will then work properly, without a line 1
                 @FUR will get an ?UNDEF'D STATEMENT ERROR.  

                 MENU program Note:
                 ------------------
                 Upon the bootup of the Cat-Fur 2.2a Enhanced disk,
                 the program MENU will BLOAD CF 2.2A ENH. ORIG and
                 do a checksum on it, if any discrepancies are found,
                 an appropriate message will be displayed.

                 NOTE: The checksum is for an unmodified copy, and
                 should not be done on a Reconfigured copy as the
                 checksum will be different.

Diversi-Dos 64k Notes:
======================

                 Boot:
                 -----
                 This disk automatically boots into 64k Diversi-Dos without
                 the use of the DDMOVER file. If you want this DOS on another
                 disk simply copy the DOS from this disk to another and it
                 will also automatically boot into 64k DOS. To disable the
                 auto-boot into 64k DOS press ESCAPE while loading.

                 Ramdisks:
                 ---------
                 Do not use the RAMDISK program on the Diversi-Dos disk,
                 or any other RAMDISK program as CF 2.2a Enh. does not work
                 with them.

                 Versions:
                 ---------
                 This program only works with Diversi-Dos 64k 4.1-C, do
                 not worry if you do not have this version as it is on the
                 disk.

                 Hard Drive Users:
                 -----------------
                 In order to get into 64k Diversi-Dos from your hard drive
                 (this was tested on the Sider, but should work for most
                 hard drives), boot into DOS 3.3 then BRUN the PATCH file
                 that is included on this disk. You will now be in 48k
                 Diversi-Dos, now BRUN the DDMOVER which is also included
                 on this disk. You will now be in 64k Diversi-Dos. This also
                 works if you do not have a hard drive.

                 Lowercase files:
                 ----------------
                 Diversi-Dos 64k does not support lowercase filenames,
                 and neither does Cat-Fur 2.2a Enhanced. Even though
                 lowercase files will be displayed in the Catalog after
                 it has been transferred, any attempt at Receiving a lowercase
                 file will yield a Transfer Aborted message.
Patches:
========
                 ^I/Macros and "?" patches:
                 --------------------------
                 The ^I/Macros an the "?" wildcard in 64k Diversi-Dos may cause
                 problems with your board, so it is best to disable them with
                 the following patches:

                 Disable ^I/Macros and "?" wildcard: POKE 57006,32 :
                 POKE 57007,30 : POKE 57008,191 : POKE 63326,234 :
                 POKE 63327,234 : POKE 63328,234 : POKE 63329,234

                 Re-enable ^I/Macros and "?" wildcard: POKE 57006,76 :
                 POKE 57007,7 : POKE 57008,218 : POKE 63326,201 :
                 POKE 63327,191 : POKE 63328,240 : POKE 63329,11

                 Catalog pause:
                 --------------
                 Disable Catalog pause: POKE 60985,96

                 Re-enable Catalog pause: POKE 60985,32

                 NOTE: CF 2.2a Enh. automatically installs the patches, so it
                 is not necessary to enter these patches before running
                 Cat-Fur 2.2a Enhanced.

Conclusion:
===========
                 This Cat-Fur took over a month to complete and is, as far
                 as we (the testers and the writers) know, it is bug-free. If
                 any problems arise, or you would just like to comment on the
                 program then please call Apple Tree // (305/556-6858) and
                 leave mail to The Screamer, account 3.

Thanks to:

                 And to Radar, and all of the other testers. Without the help
                 of them this Cat-Fur wouldn't be out for another year.
