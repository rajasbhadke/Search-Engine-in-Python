NEWS FROM CHILE

Further news comes to us from Chile this month from the KAS group
in Santiago.

The KAS group has recently launched a new anarchist  monthly,  El
Acrata,  which  carries  news  of  events in Chile and discussion
articles of a more theoretical nature. The first edition  carries
an  editorial  on  organisation  arguing  its case from a clearly
syndicalist viewpoint. There is also an article  on  the  Mapuche
indians,  mainly  historical  in  content,  and  information anti
fascist activity in Mexico.

The group also informs us that they have been working with  other
groups  in  a  campaign  against conditions in a maximum security
prison in Chile  which  has  some  50  prisoners  being  held  in
unsanitary conditions. 7 anarchists organised a hunger strike and
an  occupation  of  the  local  branch  of  the  Partido  Por  la
Democracia (PPD) which was ended by police intervention.

The group would like to receive information about activity in the
UK   and  are  particularly  interested  in  the  possibility  of
receiving VHS Video material of social struggle etc.  Any  reader
who  may  be  interested  in pursuing this contact should contact
Freedom's International Section.
