ECHOMEDIA DOITSCHLAND /June 1992

Welcome to the first issue of Echomedia doitschland, translations
from the German autonomen, radical and anarchist press. This is
probably also our last issue. We will however keep on translating
articles, so if your paper or group could use them, send us
postage and we'll send you what we have.

doitschland will be sent free to other Echomedia groups,

Germany is a very repressive state. Extra precautions must be
taken.  Telephone discussions, when necessary, should be kept to a
minimum. Things especially not to mention over the phone:

     -Forbidden papers, Illegal actions, Radical demos, etc.

 Post:

- -All forbidden papers and many autonome groups require that you
use a double envelope for correspondences. The inner envelope with
the name of the group, the outer envelope with the address of the
center where they have a mail box.

- -when possible don't include your private address in the letter.
Use the address of a center where you can pick up your mail.

- -In general you should not use handwriting. Type letters and
envelopes instead.

If these measures seem extreme you should read the repression
section of this paper. Phones are tapped, letters are opened,
homes and offices are raided, people are imprisoned.
