    I've been noticing that just lately many diffrent programs have been
released to "spruce up" your hi-res page (BBSHOW, Graphix Magic, more).  I've
also noticed that none of these program bring your picture on to the screen.
In other words, they do their thing ONCE THE PICTURE IS ON THE PAGE.  As to
bridge the gap, here's the disk you need.

    Section one: The loaders
   -========================-
      For all you who don't know assembly language or who don't wish to mess
    around with it, all of the loaders are assembled here in section one.  To
    use any of them, either BRUN them or BLOAD the file and CALL 32768.  This
    will not turn on hi-res page one or clear it.

    Section two: The source code
   -============================-
      From the start, I've decided that you should release any source code
    you have as to help other people.  In following this tradition, here's the
    source code for every loader on the disk, as formatted for the BIG MAC or
    MERLIN assembler.  If you want to just get a source listing, from the main
    menu of either BIG MAC or MERLIN, type "L" (and the assembler will say
    "Load:") then type the name WITHOUT THE .S AFTER IT.  In other words, type
    "LOADER." and the number.  It will load and enter the editor.  Type "PR#1"
    and then "L" for list.  Feel free to modify any of these and do whatever
    you wish.
