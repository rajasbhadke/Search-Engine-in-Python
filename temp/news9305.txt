³ An Interview with Jim ³ By: The Fez (2@7653)
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The following is an interview I conducted with Jim, 1@1, via e-mail. The
subject matter is regarding IceNET: past, present, and future. I would like
to thank Jim for consenting to this interview. The responses given by Jim were
spread out over two mailings: the first containing initial questions and the
second containing a list of "follow-up" questions. The two have been edited
together into one article for this interview.


Fez: In a past issue of IceNEWS, Louie #6@1 gave us the 'fictional' history
     of IceNET. Now let's get the REAL story. When, where, and why was IceNET
     formed?

Jim: IceNET was born in February, 1991, when the first network connection
     between IceNET @1 and @2 was completed.  I decided to start the network
     to satisfy my curiosity about how the network software worked.  I had
     NO network experience, as my board had been non-networked since it went
     up two months before. The initial suggestion for me to put up a board
     came from Icefreezr, my remote sysop, who also persuaded Northstar,
     IceNET @2 into starting a board. Icefreezr was very instrumental in
     getting us started, and for the first year or so was very motivational
     to me by his constant input of ideas and non-stop energy to create new
     things for the board.  The network was, in a way, just another one of the
     'games' we loved to install here on TGWN.  By August of the first year,
     we'd attracted 10 other sysops to participate in our local network.

Fez: Why was the WWIV software used as opposed to the other numerous BBS
     softwares available?

Jim: Icefreezr suggested it, and I was more than willing to see how it worked.
     I had no idea, initially, what an excellent choice I'd made in selecting
     WWIV, not only as a basic BBS, but also for the unique networking
     features.  Several months later, again for curiosity, we set up a second
     board, and installed all the shareware versions of BBS software we could
     find.  After having such a great experience we wondered how the other
     software would work and compare.

Fez: What were the other candidates you experimented with for BBS software?

Jim: SearchLight, WildCat, Major BBS, VBBS, PCBoard, TBBS, and others I don't
     remember.  Nothing came close to the ease of WWIV for both the user, and
     the sysop.  Since the 716 area is and was dominated by WWIV, many users
     already knew how to navigate.  And it's my belief that what's easiest for
     the users is the best.  In addition, WWIV has so many powerful features
     that other BBS software just doesn't have: in particular, the networking
     capabilities.

Fez: So after your comparisons, WWIV came out on top.

Jim: After several months of playing around, we found that nothing even
     came close to WWIV in providing the 5 basic features a bbs can have:
     Email, Messages, Games, Files, and live Chat.  WWIV provided the easiest
     interface for the user to accomplish his participation in these 5 areas,
     and we found that many of the users were very comfortable with WWIV
     already, so they felt comfortable right away on TGWN.

Fez: What was the release number of the first version of WWIV used with
     IceNET?

Jim: Sure I remember.  WWIV v4.11, followed closely by an upgrade to 4.12.
     We've been here all the way since then, upgrading as soon as the new
     versions were released.

Fez: As IceNET continued to gain nodes, what goals did you set for the young
     network?

Jim: Goals?  Just to have fun.  Later, as I realized the potential for growth,
     I started asking the local sysops for input on a network manual.  After
     Northstar provided an initial draft, I published the first IceNET Policy
     Statement and Application, which still contains the basic policy set at
     that time.  Namely, to operate a wholesome network between modem friends,
     and also teach other sysops how to network and have as much fun as I was
     having.  I was always anxious for new nodes to join, though it was very
     slow in the beginning (relatively).  I never had a goal for a total
     number of systems, and I still don't.  Each new system still means I've
     got a new friend in a sysop and some new users to share.  Most of the
     early boards I set up and trained the sysop. I did a LOT of this up
     through about 70 boards or so.  I know I crashed every board in IceNET
     at least once in those days, trying to do some rather exotic stuff
     remotely. I never actually destroyed anyone's system though as far
     as I know. Actually, I'm still not sure if sysops learn from me, or
     in spite of me. :)

Fez: You mean that you didn't create IceNET with any specific goals or agenda
     in mind?

Jim: The only goal I've ever really had is what you see manifested in IceNET
     today: network growth, solid operating policy, good implementation of
     WWIV networking capabilities, and making new friends all the way.  I can
     speak of the goals today, but in the beginning they were mostly just
     thoughts that continued to gel.

Fez: What was the first 'out of town' node as IceNET grew?

Jim: IceNET @13, in Rochester NY, some 85 miles away.  It was a heady
     experience, and I thought the LD costs would kill me.  They didn't. Very
     shortly thereafter, about 10 systems from 504 (Louisiana) joined.  But
     The Doc, sysop of @13, will always be the first LD connect.

Fez: What was the first 'international' node for IceNET and how did this come
     to be?

Jim: Alpha Station, currently IceNET @5851, began exchanging email with me
     about IceNET while he was stationed in Okinawa, and in about a month the
     10 or so Pacific IceNET Systems joined.  So, Station Manager, currently
     the GC for the International Group 5, was the first.  Even though Station
     Manager has come back to the States, the Okinawa systems in IceNET, now
     numbering 21 nodes, remain a very fine group of boards with some great
     sysops.
     
Fez: What other countries do you see IceNET expanding into in the foreseeable
     future?

Jim: Canada has joined, with some excellent systems.  Even though they are
     only 'sorta' international, they are in Group 5 too.  I'd suppose that
     someone will eventually help IceNET get to Europe.  As a matter of fact,
     The Doc, IceNET @13, is over there now recruiting.  It will be fun to
     gain contact with the rest of the world!

Fez: Before the release of WWIV v4.21a, what was the average growth rate of
     IceNET?

Jim: From February of 1991 to August we grew to node 13, and lost a few along
     the way, so I think there were about 10 nodes in IceNET when a sysop from
     Lousiana contacted me, and wanted to merge his small local network with
     mine. Overnight, we grew to 20 nodes or so.  I guess that doubling of the
     network in one day was the fastest growth.

     In terms of total numbers of new systems, by August, of 1992, IceNET had
     grown to around 200 nodes, with the help of Jim Wire's switch mod, and
     other multinetworking mods, many of the most talented sysops were able
     to join IceNET, without being forced to drop their existing network.  I
     think this influx of so many really great boards helped set a very good
     foundation for IceNET.  We grew 107 nodes in the first month after the
     release of 4.21a. Typically, the growth rate has continued to be about
     50 nodes per month, but it's geometric.

Fez: After the release of WWIV v4.21a, IceNET grew at a staggering rate. As
     IceNET's "major-domo", how did you feel about this?

Jim: I was ecstatic.  Still am.  And don't call me names :)

Fez: Sorry, Jim. Do you prefer I use the term 'Grand Poo-Bah' instead?   :)
     Seriously though, do you feel that the success of IceNET's rapid growth
     is due to the various multi-netting software and wouldn't have been
     possible without it?

Jim: There you go again...just call me anything but late for dinner :)

     Technically, the more recent growth, since August of '92, has been helped
     a great deal by WWIV421a.  But before that, IceNET had about 200 systems,
     many in only IceNET, and many running Jim Wire's Switch mod (including me
     on Paragon). The growth is in part due to the software that is available
     to us, and all it takes is hundreds of folks to implement it working
     together.  We did it and continue to do it very well I believe, thanks
     to the finest sysops in the WWIV world who are all members of IceNET.

Fez: What problems did this rapid growth cause with IceNET?

Jim: After about 70 nodes, I new we needed a better way to update the network.
     We were using a message base method along with a program called ICENETUD,
     which Icefreezr wrote, and I had to get to work.  I realized that any
     update method that relied upon sysop intervention was going to make for
     lots of systems not using the current update.  It was at this time that
     I approached Wayne for some help, and the rest is history.  NETUP has
     been used now since then, though Wayne has provided two upgrades in
     the program.

Fez: As IceNET continued to grow, did you set new goals for the network?

Jim: I don't think so much in terms of goal setting as in terms of keeping
     new ideas coming along, though one of my goals was to fully implement
     all of WWIV's networking features (subs.lst, IceNEWS, group updates,
     pings, etc). Some of the 'programs' developed along the way, usually
     from a seed I planted in another innocent sysop, include the ISB/IPSS,
     IceNET's excellent Space Dynasty Game (both these projects sponsored/
     managed by Daryl, 1@5900), the formation of the groups and selection
     of Group Coordinators, the IceNET Top Ten List (Dr. Diversity, 1@8400),
     continued development and evolution of the IceNET Policy. As for a daily
     goal, emptying the mail box is always a challenge.

Fez: Now that IceNET has matured, what do you forsee for the future of the
     network?

Jim: Somehow, matured doesn't seem like the right word, but I suppose it is.
     I still think of IceNET as a small growing network, full of energetic
     sysops who want to achieve some excellence in networking, and make
     friends over the modem.  I know though that the perception is different
     for new sysops seeing WWIV for the first time, and discovering that
     IceNET exists as a major premium network.

Fez: Well, I started out as a user of IceNET back in September of '91, so I
     got in on it while it was still small and remember the general joy of
     connecting with the Louisiana systems. I thought the term 'matured'
     seemed right to me. Like you, I've seen many other networks go the way
     of the do-do while IceNET thrived. Why did IceNET become a premium
     network and so many others failed to make any lasting impact?

Jim: Luck and hard work.  A sound network Policy.  A strong emphasis on WWIV
     registration. And a continuing dedication to quality and service to the
     users and sysops that make IceNET what it is.  Great dedicated GC's who
     spend a LOT of time working quietly without fanfare and getting the job
     done.  Following some of the very sound practices that were invented in
     other networks (mainly WWIVnet and WWIVlink).  Learning from others.
     Listening to others.  Avoiding the trappings of hard ball politics.
     Just having fun and letting things happen, with thought and consideration
     to what we are doing.

     I don't think that IceNET is the last premium WWIV network.  There
     are several out there, more than I know of, so it just depends on the
     dedication of the network coordinator.  He/she is the one that must make
     it happen.  I'm starting to meet more 1@1's on a new sub I started, just
     for 1@1's only, subtype ONE@ONE.

Fez: Alright, Jim. Let's get back to the future of IceNET.

Jim: I see IceNET's future to include continued growth, staying current with
     the latest WWIV technology, and some new innovative ideas manifesting
     themselves in things that will keep IceNET Sysops having fun.  I believe
     I can now imagine 1000 nodes in IceNET.  I hope to encourage the
     continuation of new and exciting things always happening in IceNET, and
     foremost, continued commitment to fast and accurate network updates.

Fez: Since the birth of multi-networking and WWIV, it seems that the goal
     of everyone who's ever BBSed is to start their own network. What advice
     would you give to anyone who is considering starting a network from the
     ground up, as you did?

Jim: I am frequently asked questions about how to start and run a network.
     With the multinetworking capabilities of WWIV422, many of you have
     thought about how much fun it would be to have that '1@1' designation by
     your name. Let me assure you, it is INDEED fun. However, when I started
     IceNET, along with a few of my friends, there really were no other major
     networks besides NET and LINK, and IceNET found it's niche because it is
     something new and different, with a personality of it's own.


So, how DO you start a network today? It's simple. Get one other board to
join with you, and you have a two system network. But if your serious about
it, then I think you should consider several things:

1 - What is the PURPOSE of the network I'm going to start?

    Your network should have a THEME and a PURPOSE.  

2 - Your network should have a POLICY and GUIDELINES for operation.

    A policy is a way of acting, or proceeding; a course.

3 - How do I send out network updates?

    To keep your network running smoothly, each system must be using the
    same node lists. As the network grows, you will need to distribute the
    new files to each system in a timely and efficient manner. 

YOUR NETWORK THEME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Think of this just like you would think of hosting a message base, but in this
case, you are 'hosting' and entire network of systems. Everything that goes on
in your network doesn't necessarily have to involve the theme; but your theme
and purpose is the foundation. The theme provides a special focus for your
network, and new systems interested in your theme will be attracted.

YOUR NETWORK POLICY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The policy you establish will be the reference source for dealing with
problems and issues as they arise in your network. When something is wrong,
you should be able to look in the policy to get some answers about how to
proceed to resolve the problem. You don't have to re-invent the wheel to write
a good policy.  Look for the basics in the WWIVNET guidelines, which contain
sound practices which have been demonstrated to work quite well. I believe
that a short, elegant, well thought out policy can put your network on a firm
footing right from the beginning.  Involve others in the preparation of your
policy, then establish, maintain, and enforce your policy.


A TECHNICAL MATTER - UPDATING THE NETWORK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As your network grows, you will need to edit the connect.net and bbslist.net
files for new systems, systems that drop out, connection changes, and numerous
other things that systems within your network will want changed.  One big
question then, is how to get these edited files distributed to all systems
in the network. There are at least three methods to do this:

1 - The email method.

2 - The message base method.

3 - Using Wayne Bell's NETUP program.


THE EMAIL METHOD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the beginning, with only a few systems, you can do it easily via email, or
just making the files available for download from your system.  This method is
probably adequate up to about 25 systems.  If your network grows beyond this
size, you will begin to find problems:

o Some sysops just don't get around to installing the files
o Unknown systems will begin to show up in email and message bases on BBS's
  where the sysop has not updated his board with the new files.

THE MESSAGE BASE METHOD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One semi-automatic method of updating the network, that will work well for up
to about 50-75 systems, is to use a special update message base.  This message
base would be hosted by you, and you would network validate the message base.
On all subscribing systems (everyone in the network must subscribe), the
message base would be set to ONE message, storage type 0.

To update your network, zip up the bbslist.net and connect.net files into
one file (called, for example NODELIST.ZIP), then uuencode that file.  Post
the uuencoded message on the message base.  All subscribing systems would
then have a batch file to run during maintenance, something like this:

COPY C:\WWIV\MSGS\*. UPDATE.UUE
UUDECODE C:\WWIV\MSGS\UPDATE.UUE
PKUNZIP -o C:\WWIV\MSGS\NODELIST C:\WWIV\DATA
ERASE C:\WWIV\MSGS\*.
ERASE C:\WWIV\MSGS\*.UUE
ERASE C:\WWIV\MSGS\*.ZIP

As soon as WWIV recognizes the changes, network analysis will automatically
run, sending the sysop feedback as normal.

It is critical that the message base be ONLY one message, and that there are
NO other files without extensions in \MSGS, which is normally the case. Make
sure you delete any *. files from \MSGS just to make sure when initially
setting up this method.

I'm certain that some of you will see ways to make this method more efficient,
but the above should give you the concept.  Of course, if your capable, you
could write special software to accomplish the updates, but the above method
is something that anyone can easily do, it's relatively secure, since you host
the message base and validate it, and it requires no further sysop
intervention once the message base and batch file is installed.

USING NETUP
~~~~~~~~~~
When IceNET grew to about 75 systems, I realized that something must be done
to improve the updating technique.  We had gone though the stages of using
email, a message base, and even had ICENETUD, a special program written by
Icefreezr, IceNET 3@1 (Alan Carauna) that worked with a message base somewhat
similar to the way Space Dynasty works.

From a suggestion by DEATH KNIGHT, IceNET 1@7, I emailed Wayne Bell, telling
him 'IceNET needs your help', to which he graciously responded to by offering
me NETUP for $300.  When you buy NETUP, you get three files, the NETUP.EXE,
and two special files DE1.EXE and EN1.EXE.  As the Network Coordinator for
your network, only YOU have EN1.EXE on your system, and all other systems
have the special DE1.EXE (this file goes into the special DATA directory you
set up in WWIV421A just for your network).

When you execute NETUP.EXE, you will see the following menu on your system.
Just hit the letter, and the rest is automatic.

Found:     22 AC's    278 systems
Using standard BBSLIST.NET and CONNECT.NET files.
B> Send BBSLIST.NET to network
C> Send CONNECT.NET to network
H> Send FBACKHDR
N> Send WWIVnews
F> Send feedback
R> Check registration info
Q> Quit
Which? 

For normal updates, I just type in NETUP B C, and don't even have to use
the menu.  Recently, in order to have the updating more uniform, I've begun
running NETUP in a batch file during maintenance, which runs every other day.
With the rapid growth of IceNET in recent times, this frequency of network
updates is required. Though not on the menu, you can also send out the subs.*
files, and I soon expect to get the latest version of NETUP, which will work
with the SUBS.PUB method of keeping the subs listing updated.  If you are
going to run a WWIV network, you will not find a better resource than Wayne
Bell to help you with your software needs for updating your network. As usual
with Wayne's policy, once you've registered NETUP, he will be there for you to
answer questions and provide updates to NETUP as they are released.

In conclusion, if you want to start a network, then do it right.  Work with
others to establish your THEME, POLICY, and GUIDELINES.  Use the methods above
to begin updating your network. If you a lucky, and have a lot of friends to
help you like I did, one day you probably will buy NETUP, as your network will
have grown to the point it's a necessity.

I'd like to thank all of the sysops who are in IceNET, and in effect, allow me
to be a 1@1 for a premium network. I'd also like to thank Wayne Bell, and Filo
for all their support in so many ways.
  
Running a network is a lot of work and responsibility.  It's also a tremendous
amount of fun. I'm having the time of my life!

Fez: Thank you for taking the time for this interview, Jim.

    Now that the latest upgrade to DOS is out, the most asked question is:
Should I upgrade to DOS 6.0? If you are still running a 286 or lower based
system, then upgrading may not really make a difference. DOS 6.0 comes with
many new features that may help you make this decision. Also, the old axiom:
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it." may apply in this case.

Some of the new features include:

DoubleSpace - An integrated disk compression that increases you hard disk
space by compressing files.

MemMaker - A memory-optimizing program frees conventional memory by moving
device drivers and memory-resident programs from conventional memory into
the upper memory area.

Microsoft Backup - A program for backing up your data.

Microsoft Anti-Virus - A program that can identify and remove viruses from
your system.

Microsoft Undelete - A program that enables you to choose up to 3 levels of
protection in case you accidentally delete a file.

Microsoft Defragmenter - A program that reorganizes the files on your hard
drive to minimize the time it takes to access these files.

MS-DOS Help - A complete online reference to MS-DOS commands.

Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) - A program that displays technical information
about your system.

The ability to define more than one configuration in your CONFIG.SYS file.
This can be especially useful if you need to have different setups for your
system. It can eliminate the need to constantly edit CONFIG.SYS and restart
your system.

The ability to bypass startup commands when you turn on your computer. You can
choose which CONFIG.SYS will be carried out and whether your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
will run. This is especially useful for debugging start up problems.

A deltree command that deletes a directory and all of its files and
subdirectories. (Be very careful using this command because you could easily
find yourself with an empty hard drive.)

The following is an excerpt from a text file that contains some general
installation questions and answers.

1.  Q. When I run the Setup program for the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade, my video
       display is unreadable; either the instruction lines are
       truncated or the screen text is unreadable. How can I correct
       this problem?
    
    A. If you are currently running a version of MS-DOS earlier than
       6.0 and your monitor is not displaying the setup screens
       properly, use the following steps:
    
       1. If you have not already done so, quit Setup by pressing the
          F3 function key twice.
       
       2. Insert Setup Disk 1 in drive A or drive B. At the MS-DOS
          command prompt, type the following command and then press
          ENTER
    
             drive:\setup /i
    
          where "drive" is the letter of the drive containing Setup
          Disk 1. The /i switch disables automatic hardware detection.
          Since display problems can be caused by incorrect hardware
          settings, make sure you enter the correct display type when
          Setup prompts you for it.
          
       If the setup screens still display incorrectly, you may need to
       manually install MS-DOS 6. For instructions on how to do this,
       refer to pages 196-197 in the "Microsoft MS-DOS 6 User's
       Guide."

2.  Q. Setup repeatedly prompts me to insert the same disk or
       indicates that my Uninstall disk is not the correct disk. How
       should I troubleshoot this problem?

    A. Your computer may contain memory-resident or disk-caching
       programs that prevent Setup from correctly reading the floppy
       disk. Remove or remark out any memory-resident programs that
       are started from the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file, restart
       the computer, and then run Setup again. If the problem
       persists, you may be able to successfully install MS-DOS by
       using the following steps:
    
       1. Create a temporary directory on your hard disk. To do this,
          type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
          press ENTER
    
             md drive:\directory
          
          where "drive" is the disk drive on which you are creating
          the temporary directory, and "directory" is the name of that
          directory. For example, to create a temporary directory
          named TEMP on drive C, type the following at the MS-DOS
          command prompt and then press ENTER:
          
             md c:\temp
       
       2. Use the COPY command to copy all files from the MS-DOS 6
          Upgrade disks to the temporary directory. To do this, insert
          Setup Disk 1 in drive A or drive B. At the MS-DOS command
          prompt, type the following command and then press ENTER
             
             copy drive:\*.* destination
             
          where "drive" is the floppy disk drive containing Setup Disk
          1 and "destination" is the drive location and directory name
          of the temporary directory.
       
          For example, if Setup Disk 1 is in drive A and you are
          copying to the TEMP directory on drive C, type the following
          command:
       
             copy a:\*.* c:\temp
       
          Repeat this step for each MS-DOS 6 Upgrade disk.
    
       3. Run the Setup program for the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade from the
          temporary directory.

3.  Q. Can I install the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade on my IBM(R) PS/1(R)
       computer?

    A. You can upgrade to MS-DOS 6 if you have an IBM PS/1; however,
       if your IBM PS/1 is configured to boot from read-only memory
       (ROM), you must first change your system configuration so that
       it can boot from your hard disk (usually drive C). To do this,
       use the procedure in the section titled "Your computer is an
       IBM PS/1, and you cannot start MS-DOS" on pages 203-204 in the
       "Microsoft MS-DOS 6 User's Guide."

4.  Q. Can I install the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade on my Tandy(R) computer?
    
    A. You can upgrade to MS-DOS 6 if you have a Tandy computer;
       however, if you have one of the Tandy computers listed below,
       it is possible that your computer uses ROMDOS, which must be
       disabled before you can install the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade. Methods
       for disabling ROMDOS vary depending on the model of Tandy
       computer you have. For instructions on disabling ROMDOS,
       contact Tandy Technical Support.

          1000HX
          1000SL
          1000SL2
          1000TL

          1000TL3
          2500XL
          2500XL2

5.  Q. I am using the Stacker(R) disk-compression program. When I run
       MS-DOS 6 Setup, I receive the message "Your computer uses a
       disk-compression program and does not have enough free disk
       space to set up MS-DOS." How should I troubleshoot this
       problem?

    A. This error occurs if Stacker has allocated so much disk space
       on your primary MS-DOS partition for storing the Stacker volume
       file (SVF) that there is inadequate disk space to install MS-
       DOS 6. To work around this problem, you must increase the free
       space on your uncompressed drive. For instructions on
       increasing the size of the uncompressed drive, refer to page
       186 in the "Microsoft MS-DOS 6 User's Guide," consult your
       Stacker documentation, or contact STAC Electronics Technical
       Support.

6.  Q. I think that one of my MS-DOS 6 Upgrade disks is defective.
       What should I do?

    A. To determine if an original MS-DOS 6 Upgrade disk is defective,
       use the following steps:
       
       1. Insert the disk that you suspect is defective in drive A or
          drive B. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following
          command and then press ENTER
       
             copy drive:\*.* nul
             
          where "drive" is the letter of the floppy disk drive
          containing the disk.
       
          This command forces MS-DOS to read all the files on the disk
          and copy them to the NUL device.
          When NUL is used as a device for testing purposes, files
          copied to it are discarded without being written to the
          disk.
       
       2. If you receive an error message, such as "Data error
          reading" or "General failure reading," during the copy
          process, the disk is probably defective. To order a
          replacement disk, call Microsoft Consumer Sales at (800) 426-
          9400.
       
          If you do not receive an error during the copy process, the
          disk is probably not defective. If you continue to encounter
          problems while installing the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade, refer to the
          "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" chapter in the "Microsoft
          MS-DOS 6 User's Guide." This chapter addresses a number of
          issues that can cause problems during Setup.

7.  Q. I want to upgrade my Digital Research(R) DOS (DR DOS)
       installation to MS-DOS 6. How should I do this?
    
    A. You can upgrade from DR DOS to MS-DOS 6; however, before you
       run Setup, you should first review the following precautions
       and carry out those applicable to your system:
    
       -  If you have any security features, including password
          protection, disable them. For more information, refer to
          page 187 in the "Microsoft MS-DOS 6 User's Guide."
       
           Warning: The MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup program cannot create
           an Uninstall disk if your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file
           is password protected. If any of your DR DOS system files
           or your DR DOS directory is password protected, use the DR
           DOS PASSWORD command to disable password protection before
           you install MS-DOS 6.
       
       -  If you have the DELWATCH delete-protection program installed
          on your computer, you must disable DELWATCH and purge your
          deleted files before you install MS-DOS 6. For the procedure
          to do this, refer to pages 187-188 in the "Microsoft MS-DOS
          6 User's Guide."
       
       -  If your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file uses any conditional
          DR DOS commands (such as ? or GOTO), remove those commands
          and adjust the order of the remaining commands accordingly.
       
       -  If your CONFIG.SYS file contains the DR DOS CHAIN command,
          remove it and adjust the other CONFIG.SYS commands
          accordingly.
       
       -  If your computer uses disk compression, but drive C is not
          compressed, run Setup as described in the "Getting Started"
          chapter of the "Microsoft MS-DOS 6 User's Guide." When Setup
          displays the message "Your CONFIG.SYS file contains commands
          that are not valid MS-DOS commands," select the Modify
          Original Files option.
       
       -  If your hard disk is compressed, carry out the procedure in
          the section of the README.TXT file titled "Setup detects
          that your computer uses DR DOS."
       
       -  If Setup displays the message "Your computer uses a disk-
          compression program and does not have enough free disk space
          to set up MS-DOS," you must convert your DR DOS 6 SuperStor
          (TM) (SSTOR) compressed drive to an MS-DOS 6 DoubleSpace
          drive using the procedure below. This is necessary because
          the DR DOS 6 SuperStor utility does not provide the
          functionality for increasing the size of your uncompressed
          host drive.
       
          1. Using the DR DOS BACKUP command, back up your program and
             data files. For more information on using the BACKUP
             command, refer to your DR DOS documentation.
          
          2. Insert the MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1 in drive A or B and use
             the SETUP command with the /f switch. For example, if you
             insert Setup Disk 1 in drive A, type the following at the
             MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
          
                a:setup /f
                
              Important: After you type the above command and Setup
              prompts you to insert a disk to create the startup
              floppy disk, you MUST create that disk in drive A. Also,
              be sure that you choose to install on drive A.
          
          3. Make sure that the startup disk you created in step 2 is
             in drive A and then restart your computer by pressing
             CTRL+ALT+DEL.
          
          4. Use the MS-DOS FORMAT command to reformat all your
             drives. When you format drive C, be sure to use the /s
             parameter to make the disk bootable. To do this, type the
             following command at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
             press ENTER:
          
                format c: /s
          
          5. Use the MS-DOS 6 RESTORE command, which is located on the
             startup disk you created in step 2, to restore your
             program and data files. For example, to restore your
             files from drive A to drive C, type the following command
             at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
          
                restore a: c:\*.* /s
          
              Important: Do NOT restart your computer before
              proceeding to step 6.
          
              Note: If some of your files cannot be restored to your
              hard disk because you don't have enough disk space, you
              need to install the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade, run DoubleSpace to
              compress your hard disk, and then restore your files.
              After you finish restoring your files, continue with
              step 6.
          
          6. To remove your DR DOS files, install the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade
             again. To do this, insert the MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1 in
             drive A, type "setup" (without the quotation marks), and
             follow the instructions on your screen.

³ How To Handle Problem Users ³ By: The Duke (59@5902)
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
                             
     How do you handle problem users?  You know, the ones every BBS has, the
ones that just leech or play games, without posting or emailing...  Or worse
yet, the ones that DO post, but keep slashing, bashing, trashing, or just
being the ultimate in "userus horriblus."  You've had it up to HERE with them,
and you're about ready to just delete them from the BBS entirely. Well, don't!

     There are many reasons why a user could be doing this.  For example,
he/she may not know what the conventions are, or they just got a modem, or
they just want to be anarchists.  The key here is communication.  It's been
said before, and doubtless it will be said again, but communication helps
solve all problems.

     First, you could send him email, asking him to participate, or
participate in a less slamming manner.  This may get results, and if it does,
then you don't need to worry about it, and you can even send him an email
thanking him for participating.

     If this doesn't work, send him another email with a little bit more
"steel" in it.  Politely request that they become involved more, or ask them
to do what they haven't been doing, and tell them that they are about to lose
some time each day.  Or, tailor it to suit your system (such as no downloading
privileges, no games, etc.).  But, continue being polite!  You may have the
temptation to start cussing his/her head off, but don't!  How would you like
to be cussed out for doing what comes naturally?

     Third, if #2 didn't work, carry out on your threat.  Don't go easy on
them, you've already given them the chance to change.  It is also a good idea
to send him/her email telling them what has been done.

     If they STILL don't shape up, break into chat with them.  Tell them that
you are not amused at their antics.  If they want to get back the privileges
that they lost, they can start reforming.  Then, when you notice that they are
shaping up, give them back their privileges.  But, be fair.  One post, or one
upload, or whatever, should not do it.  They should have to work it out, and
if they care, they will.

     Next, you can call them voice and request to speak with them.  If they
did not give a valid voice phone number, you can delete them at this step.
On the phone, explain to him/her what has transpired.  They may be stubborn,
or uncooperative, or they may have a good reason for it.  However, they should
bring up a reason at about step 1 or two, not now on the phone.  Then, allow
him/her to log on again, and watch to see that they are working right.  If you
want, you can make it so that posts by them cannot be seen by others until you
validate them, and in some cases, it is a good idea.  But, do it sparingly, if
at all.

     Finally, if you've tried everything, lower their SL to 0 for about a
week, then raise it back to what it was before.  That will show them that you
WILL do what you say, so they won't test you any more.  If they do, just
delete them, and install the TRASHCAN mod, so they can't log back on.

³ Joined At The Node - Young Sysops in Love ³ By: Seafox (1@2459)
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     After several calls from different IceNET Sysops in my area, I decided to
join. However, after only one week, there were problems. It seems that our AC
went out of town, and that gave his father opportunity to pull his phone line.

     When I checked my board about a week and a half after receiving my first
mail packet, I noticed feedback from a new user named Lorelei. It didn't
follow my rather strict feedback policy, but it did have import. "Jamaica
Joe's has gone Down. Force a callout to 2460. I'll be acting AC until it comes
back up. Lorelei....."

     About two months later, I went to one of the parties that this area
is known for. (We have a dedicated party planning sub, and average 2-3 BBS
parties a month.) When these two ladies entered, I asked them their names. One
of them was Lorelei. I responded, "Oh, you're my AC." We got to conversing. At
the end of that party, I was certain that she was out of her mind, and that we
had nothing in common.

     Conversation had been going on about having a local sysops meeting. One
fine Saturday, I decided to call her Voice and see how progress was. I was at
a friend's place, and so, in the exchange, she was invited over to discuss
network software development and such. From there, we got to be better
friends.

     The Monday after, my head was in a mess. I was trying to balance a hard
won cynicism and Relationship-o-phobia with the rather intense feelings moving
in my head. My friend suggested that we all go see a movie. However, due to
considerations of time, he picked me up on the way. After the movie, I was
carless. Lorelei graciously took me home. On the way, I told her, flat out,
how I felt. That's where it started.

     After going through the standard trials and such that most new
relationships go through, we decided that this was right. We were married on
October 31st, 1992. As far as I know, this is a first for IceNET.

This mod will change the way your main menu and transfer prompts work.
Normally, if you type '>', a few line spaces occur and the new prompt
appears below.  Here is an example:

T - 50:33:21
[1] [SysOp Announcements] :>


T - 50:33:19
[2] [General] :

As you can see, if you wanted to go to sub #30, it could take up 5 screens
to get there!  This mod will keep the prompt on the SAME line while you
advance or retreat subs, as well as directories, IF the user has ANSI
enabled.  If you have modified your prompts to include random quotes or
something, and have more than 2 lines, I'd suggest not using this mod,
because additional code will be required, and it will be very slow at 2400
baud.

Revision B Note:  If you are using the original version of this mod,
                  JAFO04, then I suggest you completely rip it out of
                  your source and install this mod.  This one is far
                  easier to install too!

Revision C Note:  There was a very minor bug in 2.0.  I forgot to add
                  a single line in BBS.C so that while at WFC everything
                  acts normally.  If you installed V2.0, you probably
                  noticed everything was kinda screwy at WFC.

Revision D Note:  This version of the mod now keeps the prompt on the same
                  line when you press a valid sub/dir number.  This was a
                  feature of the original mod, but was taken out of
                  subsequent versions (not by design).  It has since been
                  requested by many people, so it is in now.

Revision E Note:  Made a change suggested by Swamp Gas.  If a user is in non-
                  expert mode, prior versions would still reprint a menu when
                  they changed subs.  This version will keep the prompt on the
                  same line.  I've also fixed a few other problems with how
                  prompts were handled for non-expert users.
