         Stock-U-Like - 
  We stock a large range of
  newspapers and magazines
  from the U.K (such as
  Aufheben, Class War,
  Organise, Wildcat, Peace
  News, ALF SG Bulletin etc.)
  and we carry other titles
  from other parts of the
  world. We also carry books
  and pamphlets about
  anarchism, situationism,
  anti-fascism, women's
  struggles, animal rights and
  many other related subjects.
    Obviously we don't run the
  shop as a business, so many
  of our books are sold well
  below the usual price.
  
           and there's
  more...
  As well as your favourite
  anti-capitalist reading
  material, we also sell
  posters, badges and stock a
  large number of cheap and
  colourful T-Shirts.
     We also stock some of the
  latest records from the
  punkest places in the world,
  from South London to
  California and back again
  and all at dirt-cheap
  prices.
  
           About us...
  The Infoshop was opened in
  June 1991 in squatted
  premises that
  we share with FareShares
  Food Co-op (who sell organic
  veg and wholefoods). The
  bookshop is run by voluntary
  labour and any money made
  from sales goes on
  increasing the stock or
  funding radical projects
  (eg. Contraflow magazine and
  I.S.N - the International
  Solidarity Network)
     Since opening, we have
  put our energy into
  utilising the shop as best
  we can and in trying to
  encourage those who stop by
  to use the place as a
  resource. We don't want you
  to think of the Infoshop as
  just a bookshop for the sale
  of products - we always hope
  that people will come down
  for a chat and a cup of tea
  or use the space for their
  own projects.
     
           Even more !
     We have also added an
  International Reading Rack
  that holds many titles from
  all over the world to enable
  folks to keep up to date
  with the news from home or
  just see what's going on
  elsewhere (eg.US, Turkey,
  Holland, Poland). Anybody is
  welcome to come down to the
  shop and sit and read the
  stuff we have.
     Alongside this, we have a
  small archive of back issues
  of mags and papers and a
  file-by-subject shelf of
  pamphlets and books. In the
  future we hope to expand
  this section to include the
  masses of stuff we currently
  have stored away in boxes
  (donations of radical
  material is always greatly
  appreciated).
