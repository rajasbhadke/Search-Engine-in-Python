		       NEWS AND OTHER PRINTABLE INFO
		       -----------------------------
As you can see the format has undergone another set of changes,
hopefully for the better. Your comments can and do make a 
difference. It was through the suggestions of different users
that I added two of the new features to the listing, if anyone
can think of any other headings they'd like to see for the 
local section, please let me know and I'll work it in, space
permitting. I've already had to chop off the sysop names part
just to make room for the SOLONONET section. 

I've been noticing that some indescriminate persons have been
uploading portions of this zipped archive to bulletin boards,
apparently in an attempt to increase their ratio. While I do 
not mind having others upload and spread my list, I'd 
appreciate it greatly if the original zipped archive were 
uploaded in its entirety. 
The listing should (hopefully) continue to appear every month on
the first. Last month was an exception and hopefully I won't
get burdened down in the future with work and other things that
prevent me from publishing a list. Sorry to everyone who tried
to find last months' listing and couldn't.

If you use DOS EDIT to view this file and print it, I've added a 
new feature that'll prevent the file from printing all the way to 
the bottom of the paper. You'll notice a blank area between
METAL ZONE NODE 3 and 4, this will (obviously) print the same 
way as it appears on the screen and leave a blank space at the
bottom of page 1 and at the top of page 2. Then, if you'll use
your mouse to highlight the text starting at the top of the page
and continuing through the bottom of the local section, and then
click on FILE and select PRINT and PRINT SELECTED TEXT ONLY, 
just that part of the file will print and you'll have a neat, 
local BBS listing. If you decide to print the entire list the
rest of it won't be setup for margins at the top and bottom.
**************************************************************************


DISCLAIMER--
The author of this listing makes NO  claim as  to the fitness for use 
of any of the BBS systems listed within.Some systems offer materials,
adult in nature, which some users may find  offensive and disgusting.
If you logon to such a system and  find the subject  matter gross, or
otherwise disgusting,   it is your  responsibility to  hangup and not 
call back.
It  it  the author's  purpose to  provide  information to the general
public on all systems in the local area. Information in the local bbs
section may be incomplete or contain innacuracies which will be dealt
with in future publications.  The information  contained in this file 
shall  be  updated  on an as-needed  basis.  Users and/or  Sysops are
encouraged to leave me E-mail containing accurate updates. The Author
apologizes to the system operator(s) of any bulletin boards which may
accidently find themselves in the inactive listing. While I  make all
reasonable efforts to ensure the  accuracy of this  listing,  if your
board is down for a  substantial period of time and/or I am unable to
confirm  its  existance  it is possible  to be listed  as 'dead'. The 
only remedy the  Author shall  offer is to publish an updated edition
within a reasonable amount of time to correct an error which has been
brought to  my attention  and which  might  adversely effect the user 
base   of  a  bulletin  board   system  if  not  otherwise corrected.
Users are encouraged to upload this file to any local system, 
PROVIDED that the ORIGINAL zipped file is uploaded and THE ORIGINAL
name of the file is used (ie, BBS01mmm.ZIP where mmm is the first 
three characters of the month).

AND FURTHERMORE...
Like most of  you, I'm  pretty sick and tired of calling up different 
BBS's and looking at outdated BBS listings. I know it's a lot of work
trying to verify a  BBS  list every  few  weeks for innacuracies plus
trying  to keep  a board  looking sharp  and running smoothly. So...I 
have  contacted several boards in the local area and downloaded their 
lists.  When and where possible, I have gone through my compiled list 
and verified each number.  Boards which have gone out of service will 
be found in the Dead section.  It is possible  that a board which has 
been out of  service for  quite  some time may  still  appear in this 
section. The reason being that it is quite possible that  some BBS is 
still showing this  board as being active, and as long as this is the 
case I will continue to list it in the  Dead section.  I will  update 
this  list as new  info is made  available to me.  If any of you have 
info I missed, or if I accidently  mispelled a name,  entered a wrong 
Baud rate,etc... Please leave me a message on the BBS and I'll update 
my list and resubmit it. Although I have listed other BBS's which are 
a  toll  call  for me(Travis AFB),  for  the  most  part  they remain 
untested.  Should you have first-hand  knowledge of  these boards, or 
others, please leave me a message on the board.  One  further   note,
there is no personal bias against any board in this listing,I attempt
to present the facts and only the facts. 
	 
NOTE TO SYSOPS-Feel free to allow users  to access this file DIRECTLY 
from your bulletin  menu.  The February  listing contains a new file,  
which was done with THEDRAW and is ANSI  compatible. This file, named
'BULLx.BBS' is similar to the 'BBS.TXT' file you are now reading, but
is shortened and  includes color.   Replacing  the  'x' with a number
(for   WILDCAT!  systems),  it  can  be  placed  in your bulletin sub 
directory   and   users  can call it  directly  from  the   bulletins 
menu. Users will also be able to download the full version, which can 
then  be printed.    This  file  is  updated   on a monthly basis and 
therefor  reflects accurate information for area BBS's. You may  make 
any changes you feel are necessary to this file(ie, customize colors, 
add/delete boards as changes occur, etc...).  As long  as  I am given  
proper  credit  as the  author you have  creative freedom to edit its 
contents to give it that  custom look for your board, or modify it so 
that  it'll work on  your  board (I've only tested it with WILDCAT!). 
Thankyou....Steven Peterson aka Quark
