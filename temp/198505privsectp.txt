 Title:The Prophet / Reverse Polarity 
 From: T E BURNS
 Date: 05-02-85 Time:09:59

  With reference to "POLARITY REVERSE" this technology is over 50 years old and 
 refers to a UL. class A (hard wire) off- premises monitored alarm system 
 architecture which is still used by some central alarm companies in North 
 America. The system is is still underwriters approved and is loosely known as 
 the McCullah Loop System. In a McCullah system 130 volt dc. station battery 
 is imposed on a direct connect leased Telco loop between the central station 
 and say a bank. There are three states of alarm transmitted in this system. 
 The first is in the banks daytime protection circuit (the circuit which is 
 always on when the alarm is turned off by the employees. This circuit will 
 immediately alarm if any wire is cut, foil scratched, motion detector tampered 
 with etc. during the normal business day.) The second state is an open Telco 
 loop this reports failure of the dedicated circuit (either caused by attempt to 
 compromise the premises from outside or more frequently a goof by Telco 
 employees at the CO or or out on the cable plant.) The third state is a 
 legitimate alarm triggered by say a burglar (this causes an immediate and 
 irrevocable "Polarity Reverse" of the 130 Vdc. loop which is connected to a 
 bridge circuit at the central alarm monitoring station.)

  Obviously there is more to this type of system but one must remember that in 
 small towns where there is no monitoring station nearby the Telco leased 
 continuous all metallic dedicated loop is excessively expensive and therefore 
 thousands of municipal police & fire forces have historically and still do 
 monitor local alarms. If a cable company wishes to send alarms to a these 
 facilities they almost always have to send the data in a McCullah format as 
 most of the police operated alarm boards were set up many years ago.

  Understanding the old systems and their digital counterparts is one thing, 
 however attempting to hack such systems only results in the unnecessary and 
 dangerous response which police or fire crews accept when driving to an alarm 
 site.

 Title:title of my bulletin 
 From: THE SHADOW
 Date: 05-02-85 Time:15:06

 >>>ALLIANCE ARTICLE 
 ====================
  dont worry Demon, you will get credit in the article. however, some of your 
 info was, lets not get into this. have a LOT of info that most of the world
 hasn't seen yet (yes, even you Demon, the -1500 nad -2500 are loaded) stay
 tuned, i'll start dumping it as soon as its organized and written.

 >>>US NEWS AND WORLD REPORTS 
 ============================
  folks, look for an upcoming (about 2nd week of May) article in US News...
 will be on the "computer underground" Manny, the author, said he was finishing 
 it up yesterday. by the way, he is on this BBB, not sure of his handle, think 
 its "MANNY'S GHOST" so if you need to contact him go for it (if it isnt,
 contact me, and i'll get you through to him)
 

 >>>ABOUT DIALING 0 FROM PBX`S 
 =============================
  not every PBX lets you dial a 0 (the one at my high school for instance) 
 also, folks, could you do me a favor? dial Alliance direct from your homes (if 
 out of 201) dial 0-700-456-1500 or -2500. not every area code allows access
 this, i juant to find which ones. dont w billing shouldnt start until you add 
 some one (according to AT&T)



 >>>2600 NEWS FLASH 
 ==================
 found this in the May 1985 "Today" magazine, page 10.
   "Crackers in at least three major cities have been blamed for a $60,000 phone 
 bill that was sent to a Californian man whose stolen credit card number was
 apparently posted on an underground network of computer bullitan boards. 
 Officials with GTE-Sprint Communications Corp. told the Associated Press that
 computer vandals (vandals? huh? they didnt vandalize computers!) in Atlanta, 
 Baltimore, and New York used the Sprint number of Robert Bocek of Campbell
 California to charge more than 250,000 minutes of calls in two months (wow!) 
 Sprint spokesman Mike Furtney said "an investigation is under way" with law
 enforcement officials in the three East Coast cities and at least seven others.

 Bocek's mid-December bill ran 722 pages and listed 17,311 calls. the total for
 the 256,697 minutes on the bill came to $ 55,562.27, not counting an $8,197 
 "volume discount"

 >>>COMMENTARY 
 =============
   wow, thats one of the largest. but now my real commentary. "computer 
 vandals" "crackers" ahem, news media of the world, what you seem to have are
 neither. merely telcom criminals. computers MERELY were the method employed, 
 just as if it were distributed via phone calls or US Mail. "computer vandals"
 had nothing intrinsically to do with it, what if they used a car to drive to
 the pay phone are they car theives? (its their car, just as if it was their 
 computer. also, vandalism has NOTHING to do with it. i assume computer
 vandalism means wrecking computers with sledge hammers or spraypainting 
 mctiitors. this is another example of how the mass media's yellow journalism
 goes for the sensationalist. Manny, you better get it right.

  >>>414 BUST 
  ===========
   rumors of a BIG bust in 414 involving the Wizard, Phoenix, and MANY other big
 phreaks seem to have been substantuated. Manny (the reporter) read me an
 Associated Press news wire saying that 6 people got busted in Wizard's home
 town last Thursday. the World of Cryton BBS was indirectly mentioned as an 
 "underground BBS" the crime they busted them for was credit card fraud and some
 telcom offenses. even worse is that the Secret Service (yes, secret service, 
 what do they have to do with CC fraud?) said they are continuing their 
 investigation in several cities, and named some that i know World of Cryton 
 Elite live in. this could be a BIG bust. Manny, retype the thing up on the  
 BBS. he also had somethino about COSMOS sysop Timelord's bust.

 Confiscated everytying, computer,disks,printouts, whatever was lying around.

 got there, or until they started looking around on the disks they took. There 
 is alot of rumours going around about what went down. Phoenix was running The

   Ok folks, since the Shadow told the world what I was up to, I thought I'd at 
 least do him the favor of posting some of the articles he mentioned...parts of 
 them anyway, since they're long and I gotta do reall work for a living The Big 
 story:

   MILWAUKEE (AP)--Six students have been arrested by the U.S. Secret Service 
 for taking part in a nationwide scheme by computers hackers to obtain thousands 
 of dollars worth of computer goods and services with stolen credit-card numbers 
 it was reported Monday. A computer security consultant from Detroit told the 
 Milwaukee Journal that similar arrests have taken plance or are likely to take 
 place within a few days in Detroit, Seattle, LA, Chicago and Memplhis. A 
 computer bulletin board operated out of Milwaukee, the consultant said, was the 
 World kof LCryton, and contained the stolen credit card numbers... The scam 
 ilnvolved purchasing thousands of dollars worth of computer-related equlipment, 
 which was sent to a mail box rental service in LWaukesha. In March, the 
 LSecret Service installed a video camera to monitor pickups from the box.


   Another good story:
   LOS ANGELES (UPI)--A computer whiz signing his death threats "Modem Maniac" 
 has been electronically terrorizing another computer buff in an apparent 
 attempt to extort money, investigators say. "We can make your life unfit for 
 living," the hacker, who at various times lhas identified himself as Modem 
 Maniac, Lord LDragon and Bon Bon Man, said on the home screen of John Sands, a 
 record industry employe hwo lives lin Encino. Unless Sand paid the 
 extortionist $350, "then believe me you will spend more than $350 repairing 
 broken windows, broken bones, crashed homes."

   OK, as far as Shadow's invitation for all you guys to call me, I don't mind 
 it as long as I'm not plressed with something else and as long as it's not to 
 my home. That's because it pisses my wife off. She thinks I already spend too 
 much time on the computer: she doesn't want me to have to spend hours more on 
 the phone with hackers and plhreakers.

   One other thing, if any sysop of a good board wants to invite me infor a 
 look, let me know. It's plrobably too late for my article, unless I find 
 something fantastic, but it'll still hepl my understanding of all this stuff
 (or is it stuph). So long

 property (not computers either) Also was found materials for making explosives.

 he was already on probation for "Going on a BB gun rampage" last Febuary. In 
 his room was found (you guessed it!) A computer! The question is, How does 
 that make him a "computer cracker"? Nothing he did had anything to do with a 
 computer!!!!!! There is no way this should be "Computer related news!!!" This is 
 getting ridiculous!! Anyone committing any crime and who owns a computer is 
 now a "Computer Cracker" in the eyes of the public! It is time to educate the 
 media! I believe I saw this qoute here "Computer + teenager= crime in the eye

 Title:Jersey 1st in wiretaps
 From: THE SHADOW
 Date: 05-05-85 Time:10:36

 from the Star Ledger, Thursdau May 2, 1985
 JERSEY LEADS THE NATION IN LEGAL WIRETAPS FOR THE SEVENTH STRAIGHT YEAR

    New Jersey telephones were far more likely to be tapped by law enfrocement
 authories thatn those in any other state last year, a distinction that has 
 noted in the last sevven (lots of line noise) annual wiretap reports issued by 
 the Administrative Office of the US Courts. Micheal Bozza, assistant director 
 of criminal justice in the state Attorney Gen eral's office reiterated that New 
 jersey's zealous use of electronic surveilien ce demonstrates that law 
 enforcement authorites are especially aggressive in investigating organized 
 crime. Acording to the report, NJ sought and recieved court approval for 151 
 taps in 1984, an increase of 29 over 1983. this upturn reverses a trend that 
 has brought the number of wiretaps down in the last few years. All but a few 
 of the wiretaps were issued in investigations dealing with drug trafficking and 
 gambling, activities usually associated with orgainized crime.

    New jersey was followed in ranking by New York with 122, Florida with 58,
 and Pennsylvania with 46.. no other state had more than 23 wiretaps authorized
 (hmmm, authorized. what about telco "line quality testing") More than 40% of 
 the nations wiretaps were authorized by the top 3 states. in 1981 New jersey 
 authorized 139 taps, in 1982 128. Hudson county led NJ with 39 taps, Bergan 
 with 21, Essex with 14, Passaic with 10, Cumberland and Mercer with 2, and 
 Camdem and Monmouth with 1. (whew! no Morris County) The state Attorney 
 Gernel's office accounted for another 27 wiretaps not listed by county. Hudson
 County was cited as the jurisdiction with the highest ratio of convictions to 
 arrests as a result of wiretaps in the nation, with a total of 131 arrrests 
 (from 39 taps) leading to 51 convictions.

    So what is that # that was incorrectly called a remob a few msgs back? As 
 soon as I called it I recognized the sound as the same as a local # here: 
 (304) 267-9999. On the one here entering 2,5,8, or 0 will give a blip sound 
 the same on both (after getting 8 busy tones here) but what then? What's it 
 for? Anyone have any ideas? An interesting thing about the one here at least 
 is that if you call it, someone else can call on another line and it will also 
 answer them but if it's a possible conf # I don't know how to get the two calls
 connected. Later...

    Called the # in HEADRUSH'S msg. After what sounded like an extender prompt 
 and entering a # a radio station could be heard faintly in the background. I 
 hung on for a few minutes waiting for a station ID out of couriosity and an OP 
 came on the line and asked if she could help. I asked who I had reached and 
 she said it was something Data. They had a lot of lines for data transfer and 
 that was one of them, she seemed surprised that I could hear a radio station, 
 not sure she even believed me. This doesn't tell you just what it is but it's 
 a start. Maybe the proper code at the prompt will return a modem tone, just a 
 guess. Till later...

 Title:ABOUT VAX AND VMS 
 From: RWELZ
 Date: 05-09-85 Time:23:44

    To those of you looking to hack VAXs running VMS: If they're running VMS 4.x 
 on their system, LOOK OUT! Lots of hooks in the op system to catch break-ins. 
 DEC has gotten so crafty as to disable an account after x number of password 
 failures, but they still prompt you as if nothing was wrong. So, even if you 
 did guess a valid username and password, VMS would still indicate a failure.
 In addition they send bells and alarms to a security monitor notifying him of 
 potential problems. At least one site I know had the telco put some sort of 
 box (?) on the dial-up line to locate the source of a--hacker--problem.

    Your best bet--as always--is to watch somebody type his password; log onto
 his account and then screw around. For example, try to copy the desired file 
 to your local directory. WARNING, this has potential traceability under 4.x! 
 To gain access to a privileged account is a bit trickier and you'll have to 
 rely on some sys manager's negligence (as you do anyway). There are 3 
 (sometimes 4) accounts with--DEC supplied--default passwords. I don't feel 
 comfortable posting these, but the info is widely available. (I know some of 
 you are too damn good to give you any added edge.) If you're looking for 
 sources of common passwords on VAX systems, check out some the DEC specific 
 magazines DIGITAL REVIEW, HARDCOPY, THE DEC PROFESSIONAL, etc. There have some 
 good ideas in recent months. If anyone has a real interest in this stuff and 
 you think you've got something that'll hack a VAX, I can definitly let you
 know; if it's conceivable, I've probably tried it or heard something about it. 
 I won't tell you how to do something, but I will let you know if it can 
 you think you've got something that'll hack a VAX, I can definitely let you
 plus it's getting harder all the time. Use email back to me, since I suspect 
 most phreaks care little about VAXs and computer stuff probably doesn't belong 
 on this board anyway, right, wrong?

    Now a stupid question: What's a conference and a loop? SHORT answers will 
 do.

 Conf + Loop:
 ------------

   Well, a BRIEF description of each: A conference, as commonly referred to, is 
 a call made through the Alliance teleconferencing service, allowing one user, 
 the "controller", to add up to 59 people to the conference. This means 
 everyone can tal to every- one else at the same time. A oop is a number or set 
 of numbers that get called by two or more people at the same time. Then all 
 the people who call the loop number(s) get conn- ected t each other. This is 
 very handy for many things...well, disk space is limited (as usual), so more 
 later.

   Well, yes, I haven't been calling or posting a whole lot recently, but I'll 
 work on it. In response to someone's saying that I said pressing 9 starts a 
 trace, wrong. I never said anything about tracing from PBX's, just that an ESS 
 can log all the callers to a PBX IF the PBX owners ask. While on ESS, does 
 anyone know how you can find out if you're on an ESS? I always thought I 
 wasn't, but two things are suspicious. First, a few quick calls I made in my 
 area (not LATA, just local 3-digit before your four digit home number), the 
 rings were the same. Not computer-like, but the same. Also, there is a number 
 you can dial (958 in the 516 area code, it's not illegal, try it out) that will
 announce in a computer voice your phone number. Hmm.. If I'm on ESS, I could 
 get in big trouble. About boxes.. a purple box would simply be a blue box
 that generates red box (coin) tones, no? As for silver boxes, 1 own a nice 
 phone with 16 buttons, including A-D. I'll upload plans for changing a 
 standard desk-phone (preferrably bought from AT&T, don't know about others) 
 into a silver box at the flip of a switch. It is quite easy, but don't do it 
 if you are leasing your phone. That is tampering with AT&T property! Any 
 idiot that calls this a "rat's nest" deserves to loose some sleep. So far as I 
 know, there's nothing illegal about telecommunications hobbiests! Just hacking
 and if you don't screw up, you can enjoy a lot of stuff, and learn a LOT) and 
 phreaking are quasi-legal. Phree calls? Go pick on someone else, like the

 the Warehouse 1/201/273/1612, or the Armoury 1/201/276/1207.
 
 If you have hard wired phones, you are in luck. Find the two wires that are not
 being used (on 4 line wire)...connect a phone to them. The crosstalk from the 
 lines carring the actual phone signals to the unused line is enough! You can 
 hear touch-tones, busy etc. Best way to amplify:Open the phone, find where the 
 EARPIECE leads go to (on the little block)....disconnect them, and just put
 an amp there. Works great! On my phone set up I have another phone hooked up to
 the spare wires (listen in on conversations from by the modem, and elsewhere..)
 This *MIGHT* have an affect. What the effect will be, I dunno.

 Nifty Note:
 ---------------
    If you happen to have one of those piss-poor Radio Shack 150 in 1 electronic 
 kits around, build one of the AM transmitters. Use a transformer, (I have a 
 nice power supply...) or such to power it..10 volts, not 9volt shit battery. 
 Hook the sucker up to the CATV wire. Blanks out the station you have it set to 
 for atleast 100 yards on either side of the wire, for I don't know how far
 (more than a block)...Also, use the CATV wire for FM reception..... Good for
 me... I live in a damn valley.....Tune to around 100 105 on the FM dial...Get
 MTV, Showtime, HBO, etc in Stereo, or SimuStereo. Great if you can tune in the
 picture for a service you are not paying for...but can't get the audio.
