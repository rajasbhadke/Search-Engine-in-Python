Libertarian Labor Review

LLR is an anarcho-syndicalist magazine, meaning (in a nutshell)
that we argue that workers should build self-managed revolutionary unions to
fight for more control on the job today through direct action, and ultimately
to take control of and operate industry ourselves--linked through voluntary
federations organized around specific projects or needs.

LLR is issued twice a year, approximately 45 pages.  It includes reports on
anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist movements around the world, discussion of the
U.S. labor situation, articles on anarchist economics, book reviews, and of
late quite a bit of material on anarchist movements in the former USSR.

LLR 15 is now in press. It includes editorial on Clinton's economic policies
and how they presage a 3rd World US, many international notes, a report on an
international anarchist workers conference in Spain (and the resulting
rapproachment between CNT and SAC), efforts to "reform" the Teamsters "union",
part 2 of an article by Abraham Guillen on libertarian economics, and a report
on anarchism in Russia. Also book reviews on ecology, a new anarchist primer,
labor-management cooperation, Ernest Mann's new book, etc.

For a sample send $3 (which just covers printing and postage) to LLR, Box 762,
Cortland NY 13045.  If you're an education worker let me know and I'll throw in
a copy of the IWW's Education Workers Organizing Bulletin.
