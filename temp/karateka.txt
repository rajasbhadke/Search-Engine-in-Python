KARATEKA DOX

THIS GAME IS BY FAR THE BEST GAME THAT
I HAVE EVER SEEN.  THE GAME IS NOT VERY
HARD TO CONTROL.  HERE ARE SOME DOX
THAT WILL HELP YA.
  THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO RESCUE
THE PRINCESS MARIKO FROM THE EVIL WARLORD'S
FORTRESS. YOU FIGHT YOU WAY THROUGH WAVES
OF WARRIORS TO BE ABLE TO REACH
ENTRANCEWAYS LEADING TO THE NEXT AND
HARDER LEVELS.
  WHEN THE GAME BEGINS, YOU WILL HAVE
JUST CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
WHERE YOU MEET YOUR FIRST OPPONENT.

1>  MOVE THE JOYSTICK INTO THE UPPER
    RIGHT HAND SIDE TO RUN TO THE RIGHT
    (THE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO.....)
    WHEN YOU SEE THE WARRIORS STRENGTH
    APPEAR AT THE BOTTOM(BLUE) LET THE
    JOYSTICK GO, OR PUSH IT BACK FOR IF
    YOU DON'T YOU WILL RUN INTO THE
    WARRIOR AND HE'LL WASTE YOU!!!!!!

2>  PRESS BUTTON #0 & MOVE THE JOYSTICK
    IN THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER, OR THE
    LOWER RIGHT CORNER, OR TO THE RIGHT
    & IT'LL THROW A HIGH, LOW OR MEDIUM
    KICK.

3>  PRESS BUTTON #1 & MOVE THE JOYSTICK
    IN THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER, OR THE
    LOWER RIGHT CORNER, OR TO THE RIGHT
    & IT'LL THROW A HIGH, LOW, OR
    MEDIUM PUNCH.

REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOUR STRENGTH LEVEL(RED)
GOES DOWN YOU SHOULD RETREAT AND WAIT
FOR YOU STRENGTH TO BUILD UP AGAIN.
 ALSO REMEMBER THAT THE LONGER IT TAKES
TO GET FROM WARRIOR TO WARRIOR THE STRONGER
THE WARRIORS GET AND THE WEAKER YOU GET
SO TRY TO RUN BETWEEN BATTLES!!!

WELL THAT'S ABOUT IT!!
HAVE FUN AND THANK "THE CRACKSMITH"
FOR HIS EFFORTS IN GETTING THIS GAME TO US.
