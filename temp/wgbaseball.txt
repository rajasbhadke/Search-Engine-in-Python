HOW TO REVIEW THE STARTING LINEUP AND CHANGE PLAYERS:

THE WORLD'S GREATEST BASEBALL GAME comes with each team's most probable starting lineup and batting order already in place.  However, as a team manager, you can change pitchers, players, and the batting order at any time you damn well please.

To view thhe team rosters and batting order, press the ESC key.  The screen will prompt you to enter which team you wish to view.  "H" is for the Home Team and "V" is for the Visiting Team.  Press the ESC key any time you want to view your teams or to change players.

The first screen will show the starting lineup, batting order, and starting pitcher.

Press the RETURN key to view the remaining fielders.

Press the RETURN key again to view the team's pitchers.

HOW TO CHANGE A FIELDER OR BATTING ORDER:

From the playing field, press the ESC key.  Then enter either "V" for the Visiting Team, or "H" for the Home Team.

Now you are at the Starting Lineup Screen.  You can reach the Team Roster screen by pressing the RETURN key.  At the bottom of the screen you will see a prompt to enter the playing number you wish.  Enter the player number ________. The player numbers are located to the left of thier names.  Then press the RETURN key.

Now the screen will prompt you to enter the position number for the position you want that player to play.  The players' position numbers are above the prompt area at the bottom of the screen.

The Position numbers are:

        1 = Pitcher                     6 = Short Stop
        2 = Catcher                     7 = Left Field
        3 = 1st Base                    8 = Center Field
        4 = 2nd Base                    9 = Right Field
        5 = 3rd Base                    0 = Designated Hitter

Enter the position number for the position you want your player to play.  Press the RETURN key.  For your convenience, each player's most frequently played position is indicated to the right of his name.  However, a player can be played in amy position.  It's your choice.  For example, an infielder's fielding percentage will be penalized if he play outfield, and vice versa.

Next enter the number for the player's batting position, then press RETURN key.

You can change or substitute your players at any time.

HOW TO CHANGE THE PITCHER:

There may come a time in the game when your want to change your pitcher.  Each pitcher has a fatigue factor depending on his actual playing statistics. Normally a relief pitcher will go only a few innnings before his arm starts to give out and he begins to give up runs.

When you want to change the pitcher you do so by pressing the RETURN key.  Then enter either "V" for the Visiting Team or "H" for the Home Team.  You will see the Starting Lineup.  Press the RETURN key twice.  You will be asked to enter to NEW PITCHER'S 2 digit number ______.  After entering the number, press the RETURN key.

Players Himt:  Pitchers have thier actual tiring factor built into the game. You will want to watch for this when the pitcher starts giving up a lot of base hits.

To return to the playing field from the Player Roster, press "X" key.

PLAYER CONTROL GAME
-------------------

PITCHING:
      
In this version of the game you control your player's actions by using the joystick.

When the game begins the pitcher will have the ball.  To pitch, press the fire button and then push the joystick.  Once the ball has been picthed, you can guide the ball yourself.

* Push the joystick up and the ball will go high.

* Push the joystick back and the ball will go low.

* To throw a knuckleball, push the joystick back and forth.

THERE ARE TWO SPEEDS FOR PITCHING:

* Push the joystick to the right to slow the ball down.

* Push the joystick to the left to throw a fast ball.

CATCHING:

The catcher will catch any pitch within his reach that is not hit.  If the ball is way out of the strike zone, the catcher will have to move to the ball to pick it up before he will be able to throw it.  The catcher can return the ball to the pitcher or throw the ball to any base (to prevent a runner from stealing a base).  To return the ball to the pitcher, press the fire button.

THROWING:

* To throw the ball to any base, be sure to activate the player you wish to throw to.  Move the joystick in the directin you want the ball thrown, and press the fire button.

* The throw can be from base to base or from any fielder to a base.

* To throw the ball to the pitcher, press the fire button.

* Once the ball has been thrown to the pitcher, the next batter will come to the plate.  When the pitcher has the ball, there is an implied time out.  The runners are unable to steal until after the pitch has been thrown.

OUTS:

There are five ways to make an out:

        1)  The first way is to throw the ball to the base the runner is running to as long as the bse runner can be forced out at that base.  An infielder can also carry the ball to his respective base to force the runner out.  To make an infielder with the ball run to his base, hold the fire button down and move the joystick in the direction of that base.

        2)  The second way to make the base runner out is to tag him.  An active fielder with the ball can tag the base runner, and the base runner will be out.  The fielder with the ball can then throw the ball to another base (to make a double/triple play) or to te pitcher.

        3)  The third way to make an out is to have the active fielder with the ball tag the first base before the base runner arrives.

        4)  The fourth way is to catch a fly ball with a fielder that has been activated.

        5)  The fifth way is to strike out.

HOW TO ACTIVATE A FIELDER:

You can activate any fielder after the ball has been hit.  To do so, press either joystick button in conjuction with moving the joystick in the following manner:

                
                                       UP
 
                             BUTTON 1 -- 3rd Baseman
                             BUTTON 2 -- Left Field 
                                  
                               
           LEFT                                                 RIGHT
                                    CENTER
   BUTTON 1 -- Catcher                                 BUTTON 1 -- 2nd Baseman
   BUTTON 2 -- Short Stop      BUTTON 1 -- Pitcher     BUTTON 2 -- Center Field
 
        
                                     DOWN

                             BUTTON 1 -- 1st Baseman
                             BUTTON 2 -- Right Field

[ For example, if you push the joystick up while pressing button 1, you will activate the 3rd baseman.  But if you push the joystick up while pressing button 2, you will active the left fielder. ]

Once a fielder is active, release the fire button.  That fielder can then catch a ball, run in any direction, or run a base runner down.  Only -ONE- fielder can be active at any time.

STEALING:

To make the base runner steal a base, press the "S" key on the keyboard.  All the base runners will run if you decide to steal a base.  The defensive team can throw out runners who steal bases as described under OUTS.  Stealing can only occur after the pitcher has pitched the ball.

HITTING:

To make a batter hit the ball, press the SPACE BAR.  If the ball is in the strike zone when the SPACE BAR is pressed, the ball will be hit according to the player's actual batting statistics.  Therefore, if a hit is statistacally determined to be a base hit, a base hit will occur.

The contact position of the bat and the ball determines where the ball will go. If you hit the ball early, the ball will go toward left field; balls hit late will go toward right field.

BUNTING:

To bunt, press the "B" key on the keyboard (you mean it isn't located on the joystick?) while the ball is in the strike zone.  Once again, the contact position of the ball and the bat in the strike zone determines where the bunt will land.

HOME RUN:

When you hit a Home Run, the play is played out automatically.  Your hitting skill along with the player's statistics will determine home runs.

ONE PLAYER VERSUS THE COMPUTER:

The ONE PLAYER VERSUS THE COMPUTER version is played the same way as the TWO PLAYER game except:

        1) The computer is always the visiting team.

        2) You must press the fire button to generate a pitch when the computer is pitching.

FIRST TIME PLAYERS:

The computer makes very few misteaks (sic) and will challenge the best of game players.  If you are a first time player, you may want to warm up by playing against the ROOKIES--Team 26.  This will make it possible to learn the skills required to play a regular team.  As your skills improve, changing the starting pitcher from Pitcher A to Pitchr B, and so on to increase the play difficulty.  Remember that the VISITING TEAM is always the COMPUTER TEAM.

CONTINUING PLAY:

If you want to start a new game, press CONTROL-R, whenever the pitcher has the ball.

MISC. INFO:

If you want to stop "CHARGE" from playing at any time, press ANY key.
