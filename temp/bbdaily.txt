    *** TELE-CAT // V2.0  DAILY ***
     *** UPDATED  MAR 09, 1985 ***

 NOTE: THIS  IS  THE DAILY  THAT  COMES
WITH THE TELE-CAT // V2.0 SOFTWARE.

  SINCE THE FIRST VERSION WAS RELEASED,
WE HAVE EXPANDED THIS SYSTEM'S SOFTWARE
AND HAVE MADE MANY NEW ENHANCEMENTS:

+   WHILE   THE   BOARD   IS   PRINTING
INFORMATION  TO YOUR SCREEN, THERE IS A
64 KEY  TYPEAHEAD  BUFFER.  THIS  MEANS
THAT  IN MANY  AREAS OF  THE BOARD, YOU
CAN CONTINUE TO TYPE WHILE THE BOARD IS
OPERATING. THE BUFFER IS NOT ACTIVE ALL
THE TIME.

+ A  WORD-WRAP SYSTEM  WAS ADDED.  THIS
MEANS THAT IF YOU ARE TYPING A MESSAGE,
AND YOU GET  TO THE END  OF A LINE,  IT
WILL  TAKE THE WORD  YOU ARE TYPING AND
PUT IT ON  THE NEXT LINE.  A BUFFER  IS
ACTIVE HERE SO YOU CAN CONTINUE TO TYPE
WHILE IT  IS WRAPPING.  IF YOU  DO  NOT
LIKE  THE WORD-WRAP SYSTEM ACTIVE WHILE
YOU ARE WRITING, PRESS <W> AT THE  MAIN
MENU TO TURN IT OFF.

+ A  NEW CURSOR  SYSTEM WAS  ADDED.  BY
TYPING  <CTRL-G> AT ANY  INPUT, IT WILL
TOGGLE  THE ANIMATED CURSOR  ON OR OFF,
DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT  IS ON OR  OFF.
ZHE  CURSOR WORKS  WHEN YOU  ARE TYPING
AND WHEN YOU PAUSE MESSAGES. THE CURSOR
IS  KNOWN  TO PICK  UP  EVERY CHARACTER
YOU TYPE.

+ BY PRESSING <S>  FROM THE MAIN  MENU,
YOU  CAN  GO TO  A NEW  SPECIAL EFFECTS
SECTION. THIS SECTION  LETS YOU  DEFINE
YOUR  MACROS  (NOW  THREE  AVAILABLE TO
YOU,) AND THE CURSOR. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR
OWN  CURSOR THAT IS UP TO 12 CHARACTERS
IN LENGTH.

+ MANY PEOPLE  OWN APPLE-CATS. ON  MANY
TERMINAL  PROGRAMS,  A  RUBOUT  IS  NOT
NEEDED TO  ERASE  CHARACTERS  FROM  THE
SCREEN.  SO IF YOU  ARE CALLING WITH AN
APPLE-CAT OR A  TERMINAL PROGRAM  (SUCH
AS  AE, COM-WARE, ETC..)  THAT DOES NOT
NEED RUBOUTS,  YOU CAN  PRESS <B>  FROM
THE  MAIN  MENU  TO  TOGGLE BACKSPACING
FROM SLOW TO FAST OR FROM FAST TO SLOW.

+ MANY NEW CONTROL CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN
ADDED.. THEY ARE:
