|      Software which is a modified version of one of the above categories is |
|   not considered a new program in it's own right, but is placed under the   |
|   category of the program which spawned it.  This is because I do not have  |
|   the room to list the dozens of "Tree-Tac", "Digi-Pro", "Pro-Link" and     |
|   all the other names sysops tend to come up with for their modified        |
|   systems.                                                                  |

|      Those boards marked with an asterisk (*) are those I would personally  |
|   recommend.  These systems I would consider to be the top 15% of the 9600  |
|   systems being run today.  Those marked are clearly a cut above            |
|   the majority of the systems.  This is not to say the other systems not    |
|   so marked aren't worth calling.                                           |
|                                                                             |
|      Some systems, at the behest of their sysops, do not have complete      |
|   phone number listings.  The reason is that these are private systems      |
|   which accept new users by invitation only.                                |
|_____________________________________________________________________________|
|                                                                             |
|   Please:                                                                   |
|          If you are the sysop of, or a user of, a BBS running on an HST and |
|   oriented towards the Apple // or Apple IIGS, please let me know.  If there|
|   are any changes and/or updates for List information, please let me know.  |
|   It has become very difficult for me to verify each one of these 79+ BBS'  |
|   every month, much less keep up with the rise of new ones.  I can be       |
|   reached on The Lexicon of the Cabal (in 213 or 818) most easily, but I    |
|   will eventually receive a message left on any of the systems marked with  |
|   the asterisk.                                                             |
|                                                                             |
|          I would like to thank all of those sysops who have displayed this  |
|   list in their BBS system, and who have made it the most widely-used Apple |
|   BBS list these days.  Other sysops are welcome to incorporate the List in |
|   their systems as well, so long as it's contents remain unaltered.         |
