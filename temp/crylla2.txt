CRYLLAN MISSION 2088: THE 2ND SCENARIO

from Victory Software
requires AT LEAST 1.25 MB


New Features and Functions of "'The Second Scenario"

According to the documentation, while Cryllan Mission:2088, The 2nd
 Scenario begins with the same situation, it is a new, different
 game, not just an 'update' of Cryllan Mission: 2088. This seems
 to be true. 

New "enhanced viewing window" places Map, Clock, Arrow ('compass',
 not active in towns or combat), and Body Status areas along the
 right side. Nine buttons at the bottom mean

	Surface		Towns		Caverns	Combat

[1]	heal	      	heal		heal	      heal
[2]	restore health	restore	restore	restore
[3]	attack		attack	attack	attack
[4]	look/ident	      look		dung map	cmbt prefs
[5]	group stats 	stats		pass turn   toggle cmbt mode
[6]	camp		      char stats 	turn left   grenade
[7]	pass turn   	talk		turn right  flee
[8]	terrain scan	equip armor	move fwd	char summaries
[9]	lifeform scan	equip wpns	move back   survey monsters


Nurses can perform a Restore Health. In cmbt, doctors & nurses must
 be adjacent to chars they heal.

Individual char files are no longer saved to disk. (The Team of
 characters you create IS saved to disk.)

ASK OBJECT dialog button is added to obtain key items from
 certain personages.

Purchasing requires you to be across counter from the shopkeeper.
 May click on countertop in direction of merchant.

You cannot xfer characters from the 1st scenario game. 

Can bypass the opening sequence by clicking.

Names of the program files are different from 1st scenario to
 avoid confusing the parts of the two
 games: CM2S.PROGRAM, CM2S.ACADEMY, HD.CM2S.START.

    Values range from 0-99.

Experience is reflected in Level (e.g. 0-88...) & Rank changes (2nd Lieut.-Gen.).

TRANSPORTS: Papers are required to purchase Transports (e.g. ships,
 carts, etc.).  To enter/add a transport you have purchased move team
 on top of dimmed xport icon, click on team's icon to get to Arrange
 Combat Formation. Config the xport into group's 'convoy'.  More than
 one xport may occupy a square. (All can be entered, one at a time.) 
 Transport Stats show hull status and char(s) carried.

ENTERING A TOWN, ETC.: To enter a Town, Building, Cavern, or transport,
 move on top of the Town, etc. icon & click the team's icon.
 
MOVEMENT: In Towns and outdoors, click on destination to move there.
 May also use keypad keys ( 8=North, 2=South, 3=Southeast, etc. and 5=Enter). 
 In Caverns & Buildings click on the viewing window (e.g. on right side to
 turn left, etc.)  OR use the buttons at the bottom OR use the
 keypad (8=forward, 4=turn left, 2= backup, 6=turn right).

WEAPONS: Only a total of three can be carried by each
 char. (Max grenades is 2.)  Weapon must be READIED to be used in combat.

SAVE GAME: Can save at any time. Save is automatic when towns, etc.
 are entered or exited. Evidently, you can have just one Team and
 one Saved Game.   

QUIT: OpenApple-Q does a Save & quits.

TALK: OA-T to talk to an adjacent personage.

PASS: OA-P,  ENTER: OA-N,  ATTACK: OA-A, COMBAT: OA-M,

HEAL uses 1 gamma plasma (amt of healing depends upon
 nurse/doc INTelligence)

RESTORE HEALTH uses 3 gamma plasmas

RESURRECT via a res kit; uses 1 TanaShanti. Res'd char
 will be weak for 1-3 days and loses 1% from max Body Status.



Launching from Game System Disk

First make copies of all diskettes. Boot copy of the SYSTEM2088
 disk and play/save games on the copies.


Installing and Play on Hard Disk

To install the 2nd Scenario to hard disk place the following in
 CM2088.2 (or whatever) hard disk folder.  (An "*" indicates an
 Addenda Sheet addition.)  However, even the Addenda Sheet is not
 entirely up to date.

PROGRAM2088 disk: xfer CM2S.PROGRAM, HD.CM2S.START, CM2S.ACADEMY,
 and VIV.GOAT.DIR*. NOTE: the manual and Addenda Sheet list
 different names for some files. For example CM2S.PROGRAM is
 called "CRYLLA.PROGRAM", CM2S.ACADEMY is called "SPACE.ACADEMY", etc.. 

OUTDOORS2088 disk: xfer ALL folders (VIV.DUNG.DIR, VIV.SAVE.GAME,
 VIV.TOWN.DIR, VIV.WORLD.DIR, SAVE.GAME, TOWN.DBS, PLAYER.TEXTS);
 may copy in any order. NOTE: on page 9 the manual mentions
 SAMPLE.PLAYERS. I did not find this file. Instead, pre-generated
 characters are in the SAVE.GAME folder. (You can use the
 pre-generated players or create your own characters and team at
 the ACADEMY.)

SYSTEM2088: xfer GOATS* folder and SYSTEM/START* (START can
 be renamed).

Use START program to launch the game. This provides an attractive
 intro and allows going to the 'Academy (e.g. to create characters)
 or to the game Program.  Starting from  HD.CRYLLA.START will launch
 the game without frills, IF you have a saved game.
