A CALL FOR SCENE REPORTS, ANALYSIS,
PHOTOGRAPHS AND ACTIVIST WRITINGS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Houston, Texas (USA)-based zine Black Fist, in organizing for its
September 1994 transition to newspaper form, is seeking writings from
activists and others on a variety of issues.

Since its inception in the spring of 1993, Black Fist has been an
anti-authoritarian publication dedicated to radical activism and struggle.
It's a publication that welcomes a wide range of news and views and is
looking for all types of thinking.

Among the issues Black Fist has published information about in the past
(and will still publish information about in the future) include:
        - anti-authoritarian/antipartisan scene reports of organizing on
local, national and international levels;
        - prison issues and issues affecting prisoners themselves;
        - indigenous struggles worldwide;
        - struggle toward self-determination by colonized communities;
        - theoretical work on current issues as well as those pertaining to
revolutionary politics, anti-racism, anti-sexism, anarchism and creating
alternate institutions;
        - analysis from an anti-statist viewpoint of current events and the
news;
        - single- or multi-issue grassroots organizing;
        - attacks by the left and right against different radical or
oppressed groups and ways people can help to fight those attacks;
        - political music and culture, especially hip-hop;
        - radical art and photographs (will credit photographer);
