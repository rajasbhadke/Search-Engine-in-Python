        the R.C.M.P. and the Toronto Metro Task force Stormed the
        Fortress's of the Great Pharoah's they attacked the Pyramid's
        and tore down the Great walls ....and what did they find????
        you ask, well they found the great Pharoah getting ready for
        work and they also found the Awesome board AKIRA up and running
        and recieving files at the rate of 2 Gigs a week.....WOW what
        a snag for the moronic police force...damn amazing that they
        caught the guy after only 4 years and what is more amazing is
        that he only lives 300 yards away from a police station.
        Makes you wonder how much easier could Pharoah have made it for
        them??? But none the less they finally caught on ...:) well people
        as of today we have lost the best board in the 416/905 area code and
        the best board in the world.A great loss to the pirate community.

        All I have to say is that they better dig up a good expert that
        knows how to run an Amiga so they can find what was on his HD's
        cause if they stick them in a PC they are screwed (which they
        probably will try and do).

        After many conversations about the baord and his personal feelings
        about piracy with Pharoah I can say that yeah he has ALOT of BALL's
        and they probably did drag him out of his place kicking and screaming 
        before he placed a few well meant calls to some unnamed people to
        warn the Toronto Pirate scene that it's coming down HIDE YOUR BOARDS
        be CAREFULL of who you allow in the door without checking first.

        A fund will be setup so you can send your donations to the SAVE AKIRA
        FROM THE FEDS or we'll just use the money to buy a camel for him
        to make his escape back to Egypt (ride boy ride)...:)

        Well if any of you have any remarks or comments KEEP THEM TO YOURSELF
        the man went down BIG and PROUD to the last he was not one of these
        snivling little RATS that most pirateers are, soon as they are faced
        with a prospect of going to jail they rat everyone and everthing they
        know to the PIGS, and i have proof of that statment

        The INTERNET has brought in a NEW BREED of pirates "LAME ONES" and
        as far as I am concerned the GOOD OLD DAYS are gone forever now all
        you get is LAME ASS NET MONKEY'S trading anything they find on the
        net (bet you the cops have a hard time charging Pharoah cause of all
        the shareware they find on his HD's) and to make matters worse they
        think they are SPECIAL what a bunch of WAZZOO's anyone now with an
        Internet account is a pirate...that makes it a SELECT FEW doesn't it
        there was a certain RESPECT from the older PIRATE'S that is not there
        today there was a unwritten code among them, there was a good old
        rivalry and friendship that just goes not exist today, and it is
        rapidly disappering with the older pirates like Pharoah. Today's
        Scene is spreading 2 and 3 year old files and calling them
        NEW FRESH WAREZ, yeah right there is 2 gigs of zipped programs
        written every week from programmers??? give me a god damn break!

        Well till We hear anything from Paroah himself we are assuming that
        Akira is gone for good farewell to The Greatest Board around and
        lots of LUCK to Pharoah with the pigs (hope you get off easy bud)
        and a final word of warning to the rest of you  BE CAREFULL as to
        who you talk to on the net or anywhere there are alot of people
        are dead set against piracy and will do anything to take it down
        keep quiet about the boards and the Inet Site's make it hard
        for the pigs to find them, to quote an old saying

                        "LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS"

                         keep your mouths shut
