WARWICK MAN SENTANCED ON FELONY MORALS CHARGE
 
WARWICK- A founding member of one of the state's largesst computer bulletin 
board networks recieved a seven year suspended sentance after pleading no 
contest to felony moral charges involving two teenagers whom he befriended 
using his computer.
 
Michael P. Labbe, 26, of Warwick was sentanced Thursday after reaching a plea 
agreement with the attorney general's office. The victims, who were 15 and 16 
at the time of the offense, were present in the courtroom, and had agreed 
with the sentance.
 
Labbe and Jeffrey L. Whitman of Cranston were each arraigned in District 
Court in April 1991 on charges of first-degree molestation and third-degree 
sexual assualt. First-degree childl molestation, which carries up to life in 
prison, involves 14 years or younger.
 
When the case was sent to Superior Court, the attorney general's office 
amended the charges to a felony morals offense, which carries a maximum 
10-year sentance. Whitman pleaded no contestto the same charges last fall and 
also received a seven-year suspended sentence. 
 
Labbe founded his computer bulletin board "Eagle's Nest" and contacted the 
victims through the network. The network, which Labbe operated with Whitman, 
was the oldest and largest bulletin board in Rhode Island and was geared to 
general hobbyists and teenagers.
 
As part of the agreement, both men were ordered to undergo counseling and to 
have no contact with either of the boys.
