You could call this a love letter

Nicki Clarke 

Oh dive between my legs babe
i'll show you where the heat is 
Come on baby light my fire
Turn me on turn me on turn me on
Pull/my/trigger

BANG BANG
Gang bang
There's something here for everyone

This one's for you Judge Bland
And I'll say yes, so you know I mean yes
Cos I know you think no means yes anyway
Don't get confused

Justice O'Bryan, this one's for you
But first let me beat you unconscious
So you're not/too/traumatised to appreciate my gift to you
Derek Bollen, you've not been forgotten
This is just how you like it
With a little rougher than usual handling
Let me persuade you

Come get to know me Judge Sinclair
learn to love me, learn to trust me
So you don't mistake me for a stranger
Come ride in my car
I'll drive you wild

     Deliver us deliver us deliver us
Oh so you heard I give good head
     The law of god (Oh heavenly father)
     The law of the courts (oh heavenly father)
With my gun shoved up your arsehole
I'll wait for you to come
And then I'll BLOW/
YOU
     AWAY

I CALL THIS JUSTICE
