ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     As we begin 1994, with full steam  ahead for the coming year in IceNET, I
look forward with excitement on all the upcoming events...the release of  WWIV
4.24  and  all  the  fun  that will bring, WWIVcon in July (Be there!), and of
course keeping all  in  IceNET  informed  by  way  of  the  many message bases
available.

     I'd like to see IceNET reach 1000 systems this year, and with  help  from
all  sysops  prompting  their  friends  to  join  up,  I think we can make it.
Network growth is important, as  it  keeps  us moving onward with new systems,
new subs, new modem friends.  Growth will come not only from  present  systems
joining IceNET, but as well the new crop of sysops coming on into our network.
It will be a challenge and a lot of fun to meet this goal.

     We  have  a  new  GC  in  Group  2,  and her name is Lorelei.  Since last
November, she has been filling in on a temporary basis for Rocker, who has now
officially gone into the ranks of former GC upon letting me know he felt Wendy
was doing such a great job that  he  wanted her to stay on.  Thanks Rocker for
the great job you did, and I'm looking forward to your new responsibilities as
they become defined.  Good luck Lorelei!

     Now, let's get on with the first edition of IceNEWS for 1994, with  Louie
as managing editor.  I hope you enjoy it!

³ Notes from the Managing Editor ³ Louie (6@1)
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     Hi!  I'm Louie,  this months Managing Editor for IceNEWS.  These are some
comments from the M/E about the making of this issue.  Besides, I didn't write
anything  this  month  and  I  like to be included.  So, you have to read this
before the other stuff.

     You might wonder how one gets appointed  M/E.  Well, with me it was all a
mistake.  Deacon Blues (2@7653) asked Jim (1@1) about me becoming an editor of
IceNEWS.  In other words, a member of the staff.  Deacon  either  didn't  make
himself  clear  or Jim was tired and answering mail at 3 a.m.  Either way, Jim
got the idea that Deacon was recommending me  to be M/E of the month this time
around.  Jim acted quickly and  appointed me before a clarification  could  be
gotten  from  Deacon.  I started work and was well underway with it all before
anybody figured out there was a  misunderstanding in the works.  And lets just
say I'm a big guy.  People weren't about to speak out against it  all  once  I
got started.
    
     I had fun as this months M/E.  It was a tough job though.  I had to ask a
bunch  of  people  for  articles.   Got  a bunch.  Lots of nice stuff for this
months issue.  But I am getting ahead of myself now.

     I would like to thank Jim and  the  rest  of the IceNEWS Staff on all the
help they have been with getting this issue out.  Will (1@6754) and Ima  Moron
(1@9661) were very nice to me.  Jack Ryan (1@4707) and Deacon Blues were great
help to me.  Deacon did a great job supporting me in this position.  He really
was almost a Co-ME with me.

     I would now like to ask you, our  kind hearted reader, to let us know you
exist.  There is a nice little IceNEWS Questionnaire in this  months  issue  by
Deacon.   Please fill it out and let him know what your likes and dislikes and
stuff are.  Apollo (1@2939) is doing something similar with all of IceNET.
    
     We do need people to write stuff for us as well.  If you have an idea for
an article, let us know about it.  The IceNEWS staff will be more than willing
to work with you.  Just drop  me  an  e-mail  and  I, or another member of our
staff, will work with you.  I would list a bunch of ideas, but we really don't
have space for that.  If you want to write something but don't have  an  idea,
ask me for a few ideas.  I got a bunch I would like to see written up.

     Likewise,  if  you  read something you don't like in IceNEWS.  Fire off a
letter to the editor.  Just drop that  to  Jim (1@1) and he will forward it to
the proper person.

     If you would like to get involved with IceNEWS, then pick up the  IceNEWS
Beat Sub (Subtype: IceNEWS, Host: @1).

     Thanks  for  reading  IceNEWS.   Without  you  readers, we don't have any
reason to do this, really.

     It's one of those days  while  wondering  whatever happened to The Editor
and the Funny Pages BBS..........

-=- Do you remember all the sysops who complained about registering  WWIV  for
$50?   These  are the same guys who now complaining about the $80 registration
charge.  Do you think that they are  going  to wake up and smell the coffee or
do you think that they will complain when it is $150?

-=- Did you ever notice when you (the sysop) have completed the modding of the
board that Wayne then announces: "The newest version of  WWIV  will  come  out
on.."  Ooooh  that  burns me up.  Sure you can use the file to convert it over
but it will take you days to  mod  the old version......I think Wayne and Filo
talk it over and say, "Well Filo, what do you think?  I think they should have
modded the hell out of it by now, let's say we make a  new  version...it  will
drive them nuts!!"

-=- Jim (1@1)  recently put up a post about a sysop who appears to be pirating
software from his board.  Now, not  to  mention any names, but when will these
people learn that this is a crime?  I mean, the reason software prices are  so
high  is  that  people  are  pirating  the software.  This crime is similar to
shoplifting.

     Well....that's it.  I hope many of  you  had  as happy a holiday as I did
and are looking forward to a great year.

³ The NFL Pool ³ Dan Garrison (22@3461)  [Subtype: 43461, Host: @3461]
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     As the Fifth Season of  THE  NFL  POOL, a nationally multi-netted message
base, comes to a very successful end, I am amazed (and pleased) on how it  has
done.   Looking back to its beginning, and some of the rough roads it has been
over, a person might think it could never have gotten to this place.

     I work as a mainframe  computer  programmer  in St.  Louis.  In 1989, the
company put a personal computer on my desk.  At first I did not want it.  But,
then my supervisor discovered it had an internal modem and showed  me  how  to
use  it.   Within  a  few  months  I had stumbled into the world of electronic
bulletin boards and enjoying every minute of them.

     For years I have been an "NFL NUT".  When I moved to the Washington, D.C.
area in 1975, it took only one fall season, and I was hooked as a Redskin fan.
While in the Washington area, I  entered  the  weekly football Pool run by the
newspaper.  Later, in 1933, at my previous job here in St.   Louis,  I  helped
run the NFL football Pool.  Once in a while I even won a little money.

     After  getting  into  BBSing,  I  wondered if there might be a way that I
could run an NFL Football  Pool  through  a message base.  Birdhunter, a local
sysop gave me the opportunity on his board, and in 1989, the first  season  of
THE NFL POOL was underway.  I began it with a simple process.  Players were to
pick  the winners of each week's games.  We would use the Monday night game as
a tie breaker, in the same way  I  had  seen  it used in the other Pools I had
been a part of.  Players would submit one set of picks each week.  I would set
a deadline and the date/time stamp of the post would serve as  the  validation
that the deadline had been met.

     The first week we had a dozen players or so, including one or two ladies.
Within a couple of weeks Birdhunter had hooked up with a board in the triangle
area  of North Carolina, and we had competition going, not only between users,
but between two areas of the  country.   The  posts were more than just picks.
There was good banter, friendly 'swipes', and just plain fun.

     But around Thanksgiving, the company declared we could not use modems  to
contact bulletin boards, and I lost my access.  For about a month the NFL POOL
had  no host.  But, Birdhunter and some friends surprised me at Christmas with
an XT as a gift, and I was able to complete the season.

     The following  year  the  NFL  POOL  was  in  its  second  season, but at
Thanksgiving time, Birdhunter had to take his board down and we  struggled  to
find  a  board  to  host us through the season.  When the season was over, the
North Carolina board notified me it also was going down.

     So during the  off-season  I  looked  for  a local replacement.  Chairman
Paley of the Aviary made arrangements for the Pool to be  hosted  there.   And
then  I  looked  for  some  competition.   I heard from Pillsbury Dough Boy of
BoardWalk in New York.  He talked  'big'  and  since the Buffalo Bills and New
York Giants had just competed in a close Superbowl, this seemed like  a  great
opportunity.

     For  the  next  two  seasons,  we  in St.  Louis had a great rivalry with
people in Upper State New York,  and regretfully the overall title each season
went to New Yorkers.

     As the fourth season came to an end, I was learning more, and discovering
multi-networks.  I wanted to expand the NFL POOL.  But there were new problems
emerging in St.  Louis.  Chairman Paley and the sysop of the Aviary  had  left
St.   Louis.   While the Aviary was still up, it did not appear real stable to
me, and I definitely wanted to go  mulit-net.   I also knew that if I expanded
the NFL POOL, I would have to find some way to keep track of  the  many  picks
that would come in.

     ACE,  a  guy  here  in  St.   Louis, voluntarily took on the challenge of
writing a program to help me.  We  did  a  little testing of it and worked out
some bugs.  Meanwhile I looked for a new host  board,  and  found  TOAD  HALL.
This  turned  out great as the sysop kept me very informed of everything to do
with the sub.  I put out one 'ad'  in  the WWIVNet Yellow Pages, and one ad in
the WWIVLink Yellow Pages.  Somewhere along  the  line  I  made  contact  with
IceNET.

     During  the  fifth  season  of  THE  NFL  POOL,  we  had  over  30 boards
participating, around 50 posts a  week,  71  different users make picks one or
more weeks, and some of the best competition we have  ever  had.   And  by  in
large  it  has  gone  well.  Oh, we had a problem with someone questioning the
deadline rule.  We have always seemed to  have a problem with that.  This time
it went a little further than it has in the past.   But,  it  eventually  blew
over.

     Why do I do it?

     I  enjoy NFL Football.  I enjoy good competition.  Most of the people who
participate, have fun  with  the  competition.   Many  good-natured 'jabs' are
taken.  People root for their favorite teams, and make fun of the host's team.
Unlike some message bases, the posts stay away from being mean-spirited.

     I run the NFL POOL, fair and even-handed.  It is nice to receive messages
that show appreciation for the NFL POOL and how I run it.  It  was  especially
gratifying  this  past  season  to  have players from both coasts, and several
states in between part of the NFL POOL.

     For an old guy, this is really participating in the 'electronic highway'.

     When I fire up my modem these  days,  I'm  a man on a mission.  A zealous
crusader.  A cybernetic knight on a quest for  my  own  version  of  the  Holy
Grail.

     It's about quality.

     Specifically,  I'm  looking  for  great  posting.   As  moderator for the
networked discussion sub "The Best of WWIV," I make it my goal to seek out the
best in publicly posted messages.  When I  find  them, I copy them to The Best
of WWIV, and from there the messages are echoed to an appreciative audience of
BBS users on systems stretching from New York to Alaska.

     Although the sub has only been in existence a short  time,  it  has  been
very well-received by WWIV sysops.  Originally available only through the West
Coast  InfiNet  network,  The  Best of WWIV is now carried on three additional
networks: IceNET, WWIVlink and WWIVnet.

                             Something Different

     The concept behind The  Best  of  WWIV  takes  a  little getting used to.
Normally, WWIV netsubs tend  to  be  very  interactive.   You  see  a  lot  of
spontaneity, people firing opinions back and forth.  The Best of WWIV, though,
is  strictly  limited to re-posted messages from other discussion areas.  (Any
discussion of the re-posted messages takes  place on a companion sub, The Best
of WWIV--Discussion.)

     The idea is that this is a  place  where  you  can  read  great  messages
without  having  to  wade through a lot of garbage.  Every post on The Best of
WWIV is there because someone read it somewhere else, and thought it was worth
re-posting.  (Although  I've  done  much  of  the  re-posting  myself  so far,
subscribing sysops and users also re-post deserving messages.)

     But what is it  that  makes  a  "great"  post?   Obviously,  it's  highly
subjective.   It's  hard  to  give  a laundry list of characteristics, because
great posts come in all different shapes and sizes.  For myself, I favor posts
that tell true stories about users'  lives.   A  good example is a post I came
across in a networked discussion on Wayne Bell's BBS,  Amber.   The  post  was
written  by a user named Batgirl who was looking for information on disk-based
copies of science fiction books.  She explained  that she was a big fan of sci
fi, but had been having a hard time finding it since going blind as  a  result
of  a brain tumor.  For me, there was something really special about the post,
a positive outlook  she  had  despite  what  she'd  been  through, that really
affected me.

     Other messages that have been re-posted on the sub include an account  of
a user's near-drowning in the Atlantic Ocean, a story of a user's car catching
on fire and the story of a user who was raped as a child by her older brother.
Not all the messages have such serious content, though.  In my own re-posting,
I  like  to  mix  up the serious stuff with more humorous posts, the kind that
make you laugh out loud in front of your monitor.

                              Fulfilling a Dream

     For me, The Best of WWIV has  been  a  dream come true.  As a former WWIV
sysop currently without a BBS, I created  The  Best  of  WWIV  as  a  sort  of
"mini-BBS," a place where I can offer users something unique without investing
the time a full-fledged BBS would require.

     Much of the credit for making that dream a reality must go to Sleepy, the
sysop  of  The Slowsleep BBS, which hosts The Best of WWIV.  Sleepy is tops in
my book.  She is, hands down,  the  most caring, compassionate sysop I've ever
come across.  She knew I was dying to do something like this, and made her BBS
available as a host-site.  She's helped out in other ways, too, setting up and
maintaining the network connections and performing sub-maintenance chores that
I can't handle remotely.

                                Ethical Issues

     As it turns out, creating The Best of WWIV was not as straightforward  as
I  originally expected.  One of the toughest issues that came up along the way
involved intellectual property rights.

     I wanted this to be very legal and aboveboard.  As a professional editor,
I know that copyright law  can  be  very  strict about re-using other people's
work.  Even though re-posting of  messages  is  common  practice  on  computer
networks,  I  wanted  to be very careful about it in a sub dedicated solely to
the practice.

     As I  gathered  legal  advice  from  online  experts,  a  complex picture
emerged.  Technically, a post is the property of its original author.  The act
of publicly posting a message MIGHT constitute  an  "implied  permission"  for
someone  to  spread  that message far and wide, but that theory apparently has
not been tested in court.

     Most of the time, I knew, a  person posting a message would be pleased at
the thought of it being re-posted on The Best of WWIV.   Because  the  sub  is
networked,  though,  I worried that there would be times when a person who had
posted in a local, non-networked discussion would object to having the message
broadcast network-wide.  People  might  say  one  thing  on  a  local sub, and
something  completely  different  on  a  networked  sub.   And  what  about  a
women-only sub, or an adults-only sub?  It just didn't seem  fair  to  yank  a
message  out  of  a  context  like  that  and broadcast it on The Best of WWIV
without getting the author's prior permission.

      In practice, I've adopted  a  flexible  approach.   For myself, I almost
always try to secure the author's permission before re-posting.   If  I  can't
reach  the author, I sometimes go ahead and re-post the message anyway, if I'm
convinced that the author wouldn't have  minded.  In practice, I've had a good
success rate in gaining permission to re-post.  Only one  person  has  refused
permission; for the most part, people are thrilled.

     I  encourage  others  who  re-post  messages  on The Best of WWIV to give
careful consideration to the permissions  issue,  but  the sub has no explicit
rules on the  subject.   Because  this  is  a  gray  area,  both  legally  and
ethically,  I  want users to have the freedom to explore different approaches.
If someone re-posts a message  that  deals  with personal or sensitive subject
matter, I may withhold network validation while I confirm  that  the  original
author  has granted permission, but otherwise I leave the permissions thing up
to the person doing the re-posting.

                              Future Directions

     When new messages get  added  to  a  BBS  discussion and old messages get
purged, those old messages are gone forever; there's no way to get them  back.
Most  of the time that's no great loss, but there are some messages, including
those that get re-posted on The  Best  of WWIV, that I think deserve something
better.  Because of that belief, I maintain a separate archive of the messages
that are re-posted on The Best of WWIV.

     My current plan is to distribute the archived messages from The  Best  of
WWIV  in  a  series  of  files  named BOF1.ZIP, BOF2.ZIP, etc., with each file
containing 100 messages.  The first  file  is  ready  now, and by the time you
read this it will be available  on  Amber  (310/798-9993)  and  the  Slowsleep
(310/790-8560).  It's my hope it will end up being distributed widely on other
bulletin boards.

     I  would  like  for  The  Best of WWIV to continue to grow in popularity,
eventually reaching a  point  where  most  of  the  re-posted messages will be
supplied by  subscribing  sysops  and  users,  rather  than  myself.   In  the
meantime,  I  continue my quest for high-quality posting, searching throughout
cyberspace for worthy messages.  (Despite its  name, the sub is not limited to
messages that appeared originally on WWIV-based  systems,  but  also  includes
material  from  such  places as Usenet and Fidonet.  My basic take on this is,
"Well, once it's on The Best of WWIV, then it IS part of WWIV, right?")

     Seeking out great messages is a lot  of fun.  It really brings a sense of
purpose to my modeming sessions.  I'm not just poking  around  online;  I'm  a
hunter  tracking down big game, bringing it back to The Best of WWIV so it can
get the recognition it deserves.  If  this sort of thing sounds interesting to
you, I strongly encourage you to subscribe to the sub and join in the fun!

7 years ago I was an avid sci fi reader, I loved it all. Alas for some reason
only the Gods might know I managed to acquire a brain tumor that biffed the
optic nerves (drats!)  This has put a crook in the reading of my stories!
Braille can rather suck in the respect that Scifi doesn't end up in braille
and recordings for the blind seem to just ignore it. I suppose this may seem
quite a stupid question, but I get many law texts on disk, has anyone ever
heard of scifi on disk?? I have a speech system and Chronos reads rather
well..  I can feel that pulling away from reality into other realms and worlds
in your words.. How I miss it.

50/50: Ancestor's Remains

From: WWIVlink - Unknown System

 Reminds me of a story; a friend of mine had spent many years in Alaska, in
the field,studying the foxes. One day, a group of the people went to 
Anchorage, and took one of the Grandfathers, who had never been to a city
with them. When he got there, they asked him what he wanted to see, he
replied " Take me to a cemetery, I want to desecrate some white people's
graves" Has to do with empathy, if I feel as kin to ALL peoples; I will
respect,and even cherish their traditions and customs, if I feel no kin-
ship, I will not respect them,or their customs. Thing is, if I have no 
kin, I am as a tree without roots, or leaves, or branches; with kin,all
being is one with me.

100/100: I am pessimistic today
Name: >ANONYMOUS<
Date: >ANONYMOUS<

maybe it is hormones or something, but today am feeling pessimistic.  I don't 
spend a lot of time worrying out loud or overtly concerning myself with the 
future.  I figure, take care of the present and the future will take care of 
itself.  However, I have been worrying about my children, grandchildren, great 
grandchildren. . .

I can't see what will happen.  The only thing on this earth that I can think 
of that I am actually afraid of is our own government.  We have never cheated 
on our taxes, ever, but I have seen people, honest people, get into dire 
straits and not be able to pull themselves out.  Suddenly the IRS is down 
their throats like pit bulls and they can ruin honest hard working people who 
are being persecuted for hitting hard times.

When I was younger I thought those laws were to collar tax evaders and tax 
cheaters, but since then I have seen them go after decent folk who through no 
fault of their own hit hard times.

It scares the hell out of me.

Introduction
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     I originally created this text file due to the fact that in the  original
WWIV  Documentation  for  Version 4.23 (released December 3rd, 1993 @ 6pm), it
had nowhere in it any way to install WWIV with Windows.

     This text file is only for  the  purpose  of  telling you how to run WWIV
with Windows on only one (1) computer and optionally two (2) modems.   If  you
wish  to  have  a  Local  SysOp  Terminal  and an On-Line Instance, it is only
necessary to have and configure one modem.

Disclaimer
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     It is assumed you have already read the  WWIV v4.23 documentation and have
installed WWIV v4.23, customized and familiarized yourself with the software so
I may not need to go  into detail about where to place the paths and such as of
you're  already aware of how  to  do  these things; furthermore: SysOp's new to
WWIV should not attempt this because something may go wrong.

     I, the author of this text file am  not  responsible  for  anything  your
Personal  Computer  (PC)  does  that  it  was not supposed to do based on this
documentation, however; you may contact me  at  any of the following routes if
you do have trouble:

E-Mail "Piero" on:  Amber [310-798-9993], King Lerxt's Computer Castle

Initialization/Configuration SetUp
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

To set up The Second Instance you must first do the following steps:

1. Create a Directory called TEMP2 like this:

C:\WWIV>MD TEMP2 [Enter]

C:\WWIV>

2. Now Create the following 2 (or more, depending on how many Instances you
   registered for) .BAT files and place them in your main WWIV directory, for
   this example (such as above) we will use the standard directory: WWIV, you
   may have configured your BBS differently.

I1.BAT:

@echo off
cls
echo Running Instance 1.
SET WWIV_INSTANCE=1
SET INSTANCE=1
bbs.com /1

I2.BAT:

@echo off
cls
echo Running Instance 2.
SET WWIV_INSTANCE=2
SET INSTANCE=2
bbs.com -m /2

3. Run INIT, but not in the usual manner.  Instead type the following:

C:\WWIV>INIT ,2

  You will see:

SY: 

    The 2 obviously means which instance you're going to configure. The reason
why we didn't  start out with instance 1  (or node 1)  because it  has already
been configured.  So, if you want Instance  two to be a local terminal and not
use a modem.  To do that, type in your System Password like you always do (you
will see:

1. System info (name, passwords, newuser info, etc)
2. More system info (net, status, etc)
3. Paths (messages, gfiles, data, etc)
4. Com port info (port, IRQ, base address, etc)
5. Select modem type (now H2400)
6. External programs (zip, terminal, etc)
7. External protocols
8. External editors (full screen)
9. SecLev data change

A. Auto-detect modem type (if possible)
N. Update network info
U. Change max # subs/dirs
L. Update language support
R. Enter registration information
Q. Quit

Instance 2: Which (1-0,Q) ?


     And select option number four (4).  This will ask you which com  port  to
use.   When  you  change any information in instance 2 INIT, it will not alter
any information you placed in INIT with out  the ,2 or ,1; it will just simply
change the data for instance 2. So to make Instance 2 a local terminal and  to
not use the modem, just type 0 in the com port field.  That will disable modem
usage  for  WWIV.   If  you  have  another  modem connected to a free com port
(meaning your mouse or something is not  connected to the same com port), type
in the number for that com port (for the other modem) and then  select  option
number  5  (Select  Modem  Type), this is so you can compile the correct modem
info for the modem you have connected to the other com port selected in Option
#4.

This is all you'll need to do in INIT.EXE as far as the second instance goes.

Windows SetUp
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Introduction:

     In order to run two instances  at  once,  it is required to have a multi-
tasker; obviously.  And that includes having to configure a  .PIF  or  Program
Information File.

Program Information Editing:

     First;  load  up  Windows  and  move  the  mouse  over  to PIF Editor and
double-click or press [Enter].

     In the Program FileName: field type: C:\WWIV\I1.BAT.  In the Window Title
Field, do not place anything there.  In the Optional Parameters: field, do not
place anything there either.  Reduce KB  Required  down to -1 and the same for
KB Desired.  Execution should  be  Background  and  Display  Usage  should  be
Windowed.

     Move  the  Mouse  over to File and click.  Select Save As and type in the
filename area:

C:\WWIV\WWIV1.PIF

     Go back to the Program FileName field and type C:\WWIV\I2.BAT.  Then move
the mouse back up the File  box  and  click  Save  As and type in the FileName
area:

C:\WWIV\WWIV2.PIF

     Note: For convenience, I have supplied two sample  .PIF  files  for  your
personal examination.

Exit From PIF Edit.
  
Installing the BBS in Windows:

Create the Group with the Title of your BBS name.  Here's how to do that:

1. From the File menu, choose New.  The New Program Object dialog box appears.

2. Select the Program Group option and then choose OK.  The Program Group
   Properties dialog box appears.

3. In the Description box, type in your BBS Name.  This description will
   appear in the title bar of the group window and below the group icon.
   Choose OK.

4. Type in the Group File Box: C:\WWIV\BBS.GRP

Installing each instance in the BBS Group:

1. Open the group that you want to add an instance to.

2. From the Program Manager File menu, choose New.  The New Program Object
   dialog box appears.  Select the Program Item Option and then choose OK.
   The Program Item PRoperties Dialog box appears.

3. In the Description Box, type in Instance 1.

4. In the Command Line box, type in C:\WWIV\WWIV1.PIF

5. In the Working Directory box, type in C:\WWIV or whatever directory your
   BBS is in.

6. No need for shortcut key.

7. Move the mouse over to the Box with the words 'Run Minimized' and click.

8. Choose your Icon.

9. Press OK.

To add another instance follow these steps:

2. From the Program Manager File menu, choose New.  The New Program Object
   dialog box appears.  Select the Program Item Option and then choose OK.
   The Program Item Properties Dialog box appears.

3. In the Description Box, type in Instance 2.

4. In the Command Line box, type in C:\WWIV\WWIV2.PIF

5. In the Working Directory box, type in C:\WWIV or whatever directory your
   BBS is in.

6. No need for shortcut key.

7. Move the mouse over to the Box with the words 'Run Minimized' and click.

8. Choose your Icon.

9. Press OK.

Running WWIV multi-tasked
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     Select  Instance 1 within the BBS Group and press [Enter].  Then move the
mouse to the little Instance 1  Icon  that is outside the Program Manager Box,
click and press return.  The move the Mouse Back to the BBS  Group  and  click
Instance 2 and press return.  Move the mouse outside the Program Manger box to
the  Instance  2  Icon  and  click  it  and  then  press  Enter.  You now have
successfully ran two instances.  To  move  between the two instances, move the
mouse inside the window of each instance and click the  mouse.   If  you  need
more help, contact me at the above routes given in the Disclaimer section.

ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     In  this  column  I'm  going to go over the file transfer area.  From the
e-mail that I have received so  far,  this  appears to be a confusing area for
many new sysops as well as a few that have been around the block a  couple  of
times.   I didn't even have a transfer section for the first eight months that
I ran my board.  There were a  few  reasons for that: First, I didn't have any
space on my hard drive, and second, I didn't know how  to  set  up  any  other
protocols for WWIV.

     Things have changed since then.  Now I have about 800 meg dedicated to my
file  section,  with  the  majority  of it on CD-ROM.  Most of my knowledge on
setting up protocols for WWIV  has  been  "stolen"  from Jim (1@1), and I will
attempt to pass it on to you in this column.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 //DIREDIT

     WWIV has been deigned to allow the sysop to setup his/her  transfer  area
into  separate, logical directories.  The procedure for doing this is outlined
below.

A.) Name: Each directory requires  a  unique  name that designates which files
are available for downloading (or what  type  should  be  uploaded)  for  that
particular  directory.   I  have  included samples of some of the names that I
use.

       WWIV Network Files, On-Line Games, DOS Utilities, etc.

B.) Filename: This should  be  a  distinct,  different name for each directory
within the file transfer area.  It should be eight  characters  (or  less)  in
length.

C.)  Path:  This  is  where  you  tell  the  BBS how to get to that particular
transfer area.  Be sure not to put a  \  on the end, WWIV will do this for you
automatically, and you will receive an error message if you do put a \ on.  My
path for the 'On-Line Games' looks like this: D:\DLOADS\ONGAME.

D.) DSL: The Down-Load Security Level (DSL) restricts  access  to  those  file
areas  to  callers  who  meet the DSL requirement.  Users that do not have the
appropriate DSL will not even be aware of that particular file area.

E.) Min age: This feature allows you  to  set a minimum age that has access to
that particular file section.  Useful for limiting access to 'adult' areas.

F.) Max files: This specifies the maximum number of files  in  the  directory.
It  may  be  anything  up to 499.  Once the maximum number is reached, no more
uploads will be allowed to the directory.

G.) DAR: Similar to  the  AR  (in  //BOARDEDIT),  this  allows you to restrict
access only to certain callers.

H.) Require PD: This is used when a caller wants to upload  a  file.   Setting
this to 'yes' will cause the BBS to ask the user if the file is public domain.
If  the  user  says no to the question, the BBS software will abort the upload
and will assign "Ass.  Pts."

I.) Dir type: Not currently used by WWIV.

J.) Uploads: You can either allow, or disallow uploads to a directory by using
this option.  In addition, if you select  'all uploads to sysop' in INIT, that
will override this option.

K.) Arch.  Only: This option enables you to ensure that all uploads  for  that
directory  will  be in the form of your first selection in INIT for archivers.
I set this to 'no' and have found that to work best (for me).

L.) Drive Type: This option can be  set  to either Hard Drive or CD-ROM.  WWIV
will optimize the system for CDs if you have selected that  option,  otherwise
there is no difference.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              CD-ROMS and WWIV

     CD-ROMS are starting to become very common-place in the personal computer
arena  now.   Setting  up the CD-ROM to work with WWIV is not a very difficult
task to accomplish.  Since  there  is  no  way  I  can  possibly cover all the
various hard- ware configurations that sysops may have, I'll just tell you how
I set mine up.  I certainly do not have a "power system" so if it can be  done
on  mine,  you  should  be able to get it to run on yours.  My system is one I
have put together, and consists of a 286/12mhz (yes, you read that correctly),
1mb of RAM, a Boca 14.4 modem,  130mb  hard drive, 120mb tape drive, and worse
of all, a monochrome monitor.  The pride of my system would therefore have  to
me my CD-ROM, which I've had for about a year.
 
     Your  first  step  will  be  to  go  into your file transfer area and run
//DIREDIT.  At this point you  will  create your different transfer areas just
like you would if the files were on your hard disk.  When you get down to  the
"Path:"  all  you  do  is  select the drive that your CD-ROM is set to.  (Mine
happens to be E:) the rest  of  the  information remains the same.  Below is a
copy of how I set up my //DIREDIT for the 'GAMES' section of my CD.

        A. Name        :Games            
        B. Filename    :Games            
        C. Path        :E:\MISC\GAMES    
        D. DSL         :10               
        E. Min Age     :0                
        F. Max Files   :200              (depends on number of files in dir)
        G. DAR         :None             
        H. Require PD  :No
        I. Dir Type    :0
        J. Uploads     :Not Allowed      (no-one else can upload, it's a CD)
        K. Arch. Only  :No
        L. Drive Type  :CD-ROM      

     Almost all CDs that you purchase come equipped with  a  'FILES.BBS'  file
which   contains   the   descriptions  of  the  files  within  the  individual
subdirectories on the  CD-ROM.   Within  WWIV,  go  to  the directory that you
created for your files and type "//UPLOADFILE." This will prompt  you  in  the
following way:

  1. PCB, RBBS   - <filename> <size> <date> <description> 
  2. QBBS format - <filename> <description>

     If  you  are  using a CD with the 'FILES.BBS' on it (as most do) then you
would select option number one at this time, and the bbs will read in the file
descriptions  for  you.  One  quick  note  here,  turn the 'pause' off in your
'Defaults' section while doing this, otherwise it will take for ever, and  you
will  have  to stay at the machine it prompts you.  Repeat the above steps for
each directory that you have to set up, and you're ready to go.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               Protocol Setup

     While WWIV has several built-in  protocols,  you will find that there are
others out there that have some desirable advantages, and will therefore  want
to  run  external  protocols.  Some of the more popular external protocols are
Z-modem, Super Z-Modem and HS-Link.  The  following will assist you in setting
up your external protocols.

     Adding additional protocols is very easily done.  Go into INIT and select
the option that says External Protocols.  Choose (I)nsert, and  add  your  new
protocol in.

Receive batch command line            : HSLINK -P%2 -E%4 -U%3
Send batch command line               : HSLINK -P%2 -E%4 -NU @%3
Bi-directional transfer command line  : HSLINK -P%2 -E%4 -@ @%3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     That  concludes  this  month's  help-line.  I hope that the file transfer
area,  including CDs and protocols are a little clearer to you now.  As always
I encourage your feedback so I'll  know  what  to write on in the future.  You
may contact me through IceNEWS or through my e-mail address (1@4707).

³ Borland C++ 4.0 Review ³ Will (1@6754)
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     Borland has recently introduced the latest incarnation of it's line of  C
and  C++  compiler/development tools - Borland C++ 4.0, an integrated, visual,
Windows-based  development   environment   for   DOS,   Windows,   and  Win32S
programming.  The package includes a Windows IDE, a command line compiler, DOS
and Windows based debuggers, the Windows based "Resource Workshop" bitmap  and
resource editor, a series of Windows help files, and other tools.

      Turbo Assembler and the DOS based Integrated Development Environment are
absent  from  this release - all development is done either in Windows or from
DOS (with the command  line  compiler).   A  full installation takes up eighty
megabytes of hard disk space, which can be pared down to  30  with  a  minimum
install.   Selective  install  allows  you to deselect portions of the program
such as Win32s support,  DOS  support  (or  portions), ObjectWindows (OWL), or
help files.  If you purchase the CD-ROM edition, you  can  install  a  set  of
control  files  on  the  hard disk (around two megabytes), and run the program
from the CD-ROM.  While it does work, running from a slow CD-ROM is just about
intolerable.  With the newer double,  triple,  and quad-speed drives, the wait
should diminish  considerably.   The  CD-ROM  edition  also  contains  runtime
library  source code, and several additional utilities, including the Creative
VoiceAssist development kit, editors, and  much  more.   You also get the full
documentation in electronic Adobe Acrobat(TM) form, with the reader included.

      Using BC++ 4.0 to create Windows 3.x/NT  applications  is  a  snap.   To
start  out,  click on the AppExpert device  (similar to "Wizards" in Microsoft
products).   A  series  of  dialog  boxes  pop  up  and  query  you  about the
application, which seems geared to be  a  text  editor.   I,  who  have  never
programmed  Windows  in  my  life, was able to put together an advanced multi-
file editor without writing a line  of  code.   And  it works so well that I'm
using it to generate this review (the editor, that is).  For  more  customized
and  advanced  programming,  you  need  to  write  code  yourself.   Borland's
ObjectWindows  libraries (OWL) make this considerably easier than tradition al
Windows coding.  Programmers and Reference guides are included along with a 12
step tutorial to teach you the basics of the product, bringing you through the
development of a paint  program  with  a  Multiple  Document Interface.  I did
notice some problems with the tutorial, namely steps 5 and  beyond  giving  me
General Protection Faults on my main machine.

      DOS  programming  with  BC  4.0  is  also  easy,  and  benefits from the
graphical environment.  You need to use  the TargetExpert device to change the
compiler mode to DOS (overlaid or non-overlaid), but otherwise  nothing  works
differently.   I was able to compile my copy of the WWIV source code by simply
loading an older project file  and  clicking  once.  The end product wasn't as
optimized as my tweaked Turbo C++ 3.0  BBS.EXE,  but  it  did  work,  and  ran
faster,  despite  the  additional size.  BC4 will even generate a MAKEFILE for
you.

      Despite the few problems (GPF's  in  the  tutorial, slow access from the
CD-ROM, long wait for loading, even  on  a  dx2-66  machine  with  16mb  RAM),
Borland  C++  4.0  is  an  excellent  value at $199, the price for the Special
Upgrade for Turbo, Borland,  Microsoft,  and  Symantec C++ owners.  People who
already own earlier versions of Borland C/C++ can get an additional $50 rebate
for a limited time.  The CD-ROM version adds additional value to  the  package
and speeds installation greatly, in addition to freeing you from constant disk
tending.   I've  become  quite enamored with the product myself.  Now, if only
Wayne Bell would use  this  to  port  WWIV  to  a  Windows platform.  With the
EasyWin feature, it shouldn't be too hard...

                      Chapter One: The History of C

EARLY BEGINNINGS

     The language of C was invented by Dennis Ritchie in the  1970s.   It  was
influenced  by an earlier language named B, developed by Ken Thompson in 1970,
which was itself the successor  to  a  language called BCPL, written my Martin
Richards (Holzner 2).

     Because of the restrictions in B, Ritchie  and  Thompson  created  the  C
language.   It did not gain popularity, however, until the publishing of their
famous book - The  C  Programming  Language  (Prentice Hall, 1978).  This book
would describe the standard for programming  in  C  for  the  next  few  years
(Schildt, Complete Reference 5).

     As  the  PC  revolution began with the release of the IBM PC in 1981, the
growing number of microcomputers increased  the  number of diverse C implemen-
tations (Holzner 2).  In 1983, a committee was organized  to  create  an  ANSI
standard  for  C. This standard was finally adopted in 1990 (Schildt, Complete
Reference 5).


A MIDDLE-LEVEL LANGUAGE

     C is called a  "middle  level  language."  This  implies  that is has the
functionality and ease of use as high-level  languages,  such  as  Pascal  and
Modula-2,  but  also  the  power  of  low-level  languages,  such  as Assembly
(Schildt, Complete Reference 6).

          Highest level                 Ada
                                        Modula-2
                                        Pascal
                                        COBOL
                                        FORTRAN
                                        BASIC

          Middle level                  C
                                        Macro-assembly

          Lowest level                  Assembly

     Being a middle-level language,  C  allows  for the direct manipulation of
bits, bytes and addresses - the very basic  elements  of  computer  processes.
Another  important feature of C is that it has only 32 keywords (11 more added
by Turbo C).  This greatly reduces the  amount of code that has to be compiled
within the file (Schildt, Complete  Reference  6).   C  produces  tighter  and
faster object code than most other languages.

     ANSI C's 32 keywords

     auto           break          case           char
     const          continue       default        do
     double         else           enum           extern
     float          for            goto           if
     int            long           register       return
     short          signed         sizeof         static
     struct         switch         typedef        union
     unsigned       void           volatile       while

     Turbo C extended keywords

     asm            _ss            interrupt      _cs
     cdecl          near           _ds            far
     pascal         _es            huge


C HAS WIDE APPLICATIONS

     C  is  also  a  very portable language.  "Portability" means that you can
take C code written for  one  machine  (an  IBM, for example) and compile that
code on another machine (such as an Apple)  with  little  or  no  modification
(Schildt, Complete Reference 6).

     C  gives  more power to the programmer than do most other languages.  For
example, character  and  integer  data  types  may  be  freely intermixed, and
run-time error checking (such as array-boundary or argument-type checking)  is
not  performed.   These  checks  are  the  responsibility  of  the  programmer
(Schildt,  Complete  Reference  7).  C is a programmer's language.  "It is not
the contrived product of a  committee,  but  rather the outcome of programmers
looking for a better language" (Schildt, Teach Yourself xv).

     With the added power at the disposal of the  programmer,  however,  comes
added responsibilities.  It is quite easy to crash your computer with only the
simplest  of  errors in your code.  "You have the power to do things in C that
other languages would never allow  you  to  do" (Holzner 3).  This however, as
you will find, is a greater benefit than it is a curse.

     "Initially, C was used primarily for creating systems software.   Systems
software consists of those programs that help run the computer.  This includes
such  programs  as  operating systems, compilers, and editors" (Schildt, Teach
Yourself xvi).  Because of the increasing  popularity of C, today the language
is used by all sorts of programmers for almost any purpose.  It is a powerful,
yet multifaceted language.  Until C, the only way to get complete control over
the inner workings of your machine, and hence to create systems software,  was
to program with Assembly.

     Assembly,  however  is  a  very  difficult language to write long or user
friendly programs with.  "In fact, it  may  take  you dozens of pages of frus-
tration to get where you want to go" (Holzner  3).   The  C  instructions  are
designed  very  closely  to  their assembly language equivalents, however many
more advanced functions have been added to  give  C much more power.  C is the
"perfect combination control and power" (Holzner 3).

NEXT ISSUE

     That concludes an overview of  the  history  and  development  of  the  C
programming  language.   Next  month we will continue this four part series by
examining the fundamentals  of  C.  We  will  discuss  the  components  of a C
program, create and compile our first program, look at variables and the  five
basic data types.

³ Trials of a CyberCop ³ Pale Rider (1@23)
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     Real BBS names are left out for legal reasons.

     What  is  a  CyberCop?   The  cop  of  the lines, the BBS police, the SPA
(Software Publishers Association) and those affiliated with them.  There was a
time, years ago, where piracy  ran rampant, uncontrollable, infesting the very
fiber of what is known as the "CyberSpace." That's where I come in.   My  name
is Pale Rider...  I'm a CyberCop.

     The wind howled, rain beat off the window like small pebbles bouncing  in
a  tin  pan.   The "clickety-click"  of my fingers tapping into the Focus 5000
could  be  heard  throughout  the  house  like  an eager  secretary  on Friday
afternoon.  The phone rang.  I answered in a small voice, trying too  hard  to
sound like a 15 year old.  It was Him, the call I was expecting.

     "Uhhhh, is Pale Rider there," the person on the other side asked.
 
     "Uhhh, yeah that's me. Who's this," I asked with a childlike voice.

     "Uhhh, I validated you, and gave you 'Elite' access."

     "Uhhh,  cool!   I  got  megs  of files I can upload," I exclaimed, with a
dog-like pant.

     "Uhhh, you're not a cop or anything are you?"

     "Uhhh, no, I'm not old enough,"  I  half-yelled, knowing full well that I
could be a cop tomorrow if I wanted to.

     "Uhhh, ok, well, see ya later!" .

     "Latah!" I said as I slammed the phone down into its cradle.

     My blue light reflected off my monitor like a small pearl  in  a  sea  of
black.   I  fired-up  my  trusty  term  program and keyed in the number that I
wanted to dial.  "EtErNaL  dArKnEsS."  The  name  said  it all.  "Beep!  Beep!
Beep!" signaled the computer, telling me that I was now online.

        "Enter Name: Pale Rider"
        "Enter Password: XXXXXX"
        "Enter System Password: XXXXXXXXX"
        "Enter Second System Password: XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        "Enter Password that means you can't get on if you don't know it:
         XXXXX"

     The poor boy.  Little does he know that you can't protect  yourself  when
you  have  a  crime in your hands and a cop on your back.  I sit back, waiting
five minutes while the multitude of c00l ANSI screens wizz by.  A sip of black
coffee, a Pall Mall, and a  blood  clot  later  I get to the main prompt.  "F"
sends me to the files section, I quickly look around my room, for some  reason
I'm paranoid that I'm being watched.  I'll take advantage of it.  I hit "C" so
that i can chat with the unsuspecting sysop.

     "Yeah?" I see slowly typed across the screen.  I position one hand behind
my  back  so  that  I  can  type slightly slower than the sysop.  I don't want
"Typing Envy" to get in the way of my bust.

     "I got a new game called  'Syndicate,'  it's put out by 'Electronic Arts'
but I don't have a crack for it.  Do you want it?" I already know the  answer,
but you can't catch a fish without the hook.

     "Sure,  go  ahead  and  upload  it, I'll hex it later and fix the CP!" he
types shortly before breaking out of chat.

     I nail keys before it's to late, GOT IT!  Now on disk, I have the SysOp's
agreement to accept a copyrighted game.  I  shell out and go into my Syndicate
directory, I zip up Syndicate and look at the file size then write it down.  I
then go into my DOS directory and "ARC" everything in there.  The file size is
close enough, I rename DOS.ARC to SYNDICA.ZIP.  The chances of  him  having  a
dinosaur like ARC around is about the same chance as Clinton being faithful to
his wife.

     I  exit the shell and tap "U," then enter the description.  After a Roast
Beef on Whole Wheat and  a  Pall  Mall,  the computer yells, "Beep!  Beep!" to
tell me that the file was uploaded.  I'm playing everything right,  the  SysOp
doesn't have a clue, and now it's time to get the rest of my evidence and then
jack out.

     I  hit  the  "F"  key to get a list of all files on-line.  About 300 megs
worth of copyrighted material is  found.   If everything works out, he's going
to have a hefty fine to pay.  With that done, I download about a meg worth  of
what is obviously copyrighted software.  Then, I'm history.  I logoff and drop
to DOS to assemble my report:

        User name I logged on with: Pale Rider
        Passwords used respectively: ... ... ...
        Files downloaded: XXXXXXX, verified copyrighted and working.
                          XXXXX, verified copyrighted and working.

     I put everything together into one text file and type "print BUSTED.TXT."
Almost done, I call up the SPA:

     "Software Publishers," the soft female voice says.

     "This is SPECTRUM.  I've got some goodies." I say in a cool voice, trying
to get the sweet sounding voice to respond.

     "Great!   Just  fax  them  in!" She replies, not a hint of interest in my
persona anywhere in there.  Oh well.

     I slam the phone down and load up the fax program.  Here we go!  25 pages
of information and evidence is sent  over  to the SPA.  Soon, Eternal Darkness
will be shut down forever.  The damage I did to the piracy  front  is  only  a
pebble  nicked  out of a boulder, but I know that I did something.  I sit back
in my old office chair and kick my  feet  up on the table, puffing on my smoke
and grinning.  Appreciating myself because I know, that for at least one  time
in my life, I did something right.

              *               *               *               *

     What I am doing cannot be considered entrapment.  It's easy really, I'm a
non company, non legal affiliated person.  By being a normal person, I can get
evidence  against someone any way I want to.  When I am asked if I am a cop or
if I am affiliated  with  any  software  company,  I  simply say no.  It's the
truth.  I am not getting paid for this.  I am on no one's payroll.

     What pirates don't know is that there are a lot of  people  like  me  all
over  the place.  In every village, in every metropolis, there are people that
are tired of seeing good  software  companies  go  down the tubes because they
can't afford to pay their programmers.  I'm sure you think they are  making  a
lot  of  money, but here is a little tidbit of information for you: The amount
of profits lost due to pirating in  1992  was equal to or more than the annual
profits from 85 of the top 100 software companies based in the United States.

     Some people have asked me about my morals.   They  think  it  is  morally
wrong  to do what I'm doing.  However, if someone was to break into your house
and steal your computer, you would be  a little upset, no?  "It's not the same
thing," you cry, but it is.  Theft, stealing a car, a  bike,  a  computer,  or
software  is  still  theft.   And  being  theft, it is punishable by law.  The
penalties for piracy have steadily risen  in  the  past 4 years.  In 1989, the
fines were $10,000 per count of copyright infringement.   In  1993  the  fines

     Editor's  note  :  "The Adventures Of ModemMan" is a multi-part adventure
that will be continued in a serialized format.

     "In the not-so-distant  future,  a  Top-Secret government experiment goes
awry.  A computer-geek with the intelligence of  a  doorknob  is  accidentally
transformed  mentally  and  physically  by a combination of science, medicine,
technology, and dumb luck.  The  result:  the world's first LIVING COMPUTER...
ModemMan!  Disguised as Joe Modem, a mild-mannered sysop of a small electronic
bulletin board service  in  a  large  metropolitan  city,  ModemMan  fights  a
neverending  battle  with  the  sinister  forces of evil to protect the world,
bringing truth, justice, and a higher transfer rate to all..."

                            "Insufficient Memory"

                       Chapter One: "Press ESC To Exit"

     Joe Modem was sitting at his  computer one day, dreaming about WWIV v5.24
and waiting for a call.  The phone rang. Joe snapped out of his  daydream  and
watched  the  terminal.   "Darn," he exclaimed, "just another 'hanger-upper.'"
Yes, it was one of those calls that all sysops despise, someone calling random
numbers and hanging up.  Of course, the system froze.  Undaunted, Joe gathered
all of his might and pushed  the  reset button.  Simultaneously, the BBS phone
rang.  Nervously, Joe did a 'bare boot' and quickly loaded the  BBS  software.
Whew,  he  thought  as the caller connected, I didn't think I would make it on
time.  Joe sat back and relaxed as the caller logged on.

                      Welcome to The Brooklyn Blues BBS!

 Name,number,or new: NN: NEW
 
     Welcome again to the Brooklyn Blues BBS! Bla blah bla blah bla blah...

 ANSI? :N

 bla bla bla bla...
     
     It turned out this guy's name  was  Egg's  Head  and he claimed to be the
owner of a local software superstore.  The newbie then requested to chat  with
Joe.   Being  a  nice guy and a friendly sysop - and thinking that if this guy
really did own a software  store  that  it  would  be in his best interests to
suck-up to the guy - Joe pressed F10 to chat:

     "Hi! Wassup," typed Joe from his keyboard.

     "Hello," replied the caller.  "Yer Joe Modem, right?"

     "Yep... That's me... What can I do for ya?"

     "Well...  You saw my validation feedback, right?  Right. I'm the owner of
Egg's Head Software."

     Joe was non-plussed.  He'd seen  software  stores  come  and  go  before.
"Yeah?  So?"

     "Well,"  continued  the  caller,  "I'd  like  to invite you tonight to...
uhh...  take a free shopping spree in my store."

     Joe was taken aback.  He'd never been the recipient of such an invitation
before.  Most software store owners  rarely  gave  away free advice, let alone
free product.  "Yeah?  You mean it?"

     "Yup..." replied the caller.  "It's down on Pier 12 and 1/2.   Just  make
sure  to say the password 'Turbo' to one of the salesmen and he'll dispo...  I
mean show you around."

     Joe was quite enthused by the  prospect.   He'd been waiting for a chance
to  get  his  Windowless  DDT  upgrade  and  this  seemed  like  the   perfect
opportunity.  "Thanx!  I'll be there ASAYLO!!"

     "ASAYLO?"

     Joe smiled. "As soon as you log off..."

     "Oh..."  responded  the  caller,  seemingly  less-than-impressed by Joe's
ability to come up with  a  witty  computer  acronym.  "Well, l8r c-ya." Egg's
Head logged off and Joe went back to his usual  routine,  which  consisted  of
sitting at his computer, waiting for calls...

     8:15 that night, Pier 12 and 1/2...

     Joe  got  into  his  car and drove to the address given.  Pier 12 and 1/2
was, as one might expect, in the dockyard area of The Big Apple, the city that
Joe affectionately called home.  As the passing breeze wafted through the open
windows in Joe's car,  he  could  tell  that  it  was  low-tide.  The sound of
seagulls and the occasional clanging of a buoy warning  bell  drifted  through
the silence and a slight mist covered the area, lowering visibility and adding
to the overall level of eerieness.

     Joe  peered  out of his window at the store as he pulled into the parking
area, failing  to  notice  the  restricted  parking  sign  there.  The "store"
appeared to be a converted small warehouse, not unlike the majority  of  other
buildings  that  populated  the  wharf.   The  major  difference that set this
building apart from the others was  the  sign above the door designating it as
"Egg Head's Software Supermarket." The sign  was  no  more  than  an  ordinary
computer-made  printout on standard computer paper, complete with tractor feet
holes intact, tacked onto a piece of plywood that appeared to have been rather
hastily placed above the door.  Joe could see a light coming from the door.

     As he ventured into the store, he noticed that the place was a mess - not
unlike his apartment.  There were  a  couple  of  old racks hanging about with
various computer-related items stacked haphazardly on them.  A glass case  was
located  near  the  rear of the store.  Behind it stood a tall man, perhaps in
his late  20's  and  wearing  a  button-down  plaid  flannel  shirt.   The man
alternated between watching Joe as he moved through the store  and  apparently
inputting  data  into a computer located behind the counter.  Joe also noticed
that there were  no  customers  inside.   Strange,  thought  Joe, any computer
store, even a ramshackle rinky-dink store like this, should be busy.  Hmm...

     Joe shook it off, remembering his real reason for coming  to  the  store.
Even though the place looked pretty sparse, Joe had been chosen - by the owner
himself, no less - to be the recipient of free software.  An offer that he, or
any  other  computer  user, the thought, could not pass-up.  He proudly walked
over to the salesman behind  the  glass  display  case.  The tag on the person
claimed that he was named 'Blue Ray.'

     "How can I help you, sir," asked Blue Ray.

     Joe leaned up against the counter, looking shiftily from left  to  right,
squinting  his  eyes  as he did so.  Joe motioned the salesman to come closer.
The man leaned slightly  over  the  counter  and  Joe whispered into the man's
ears:

     "Turbo..."

     The salesman replied, "Sorry bud, we're all out of  v.terbo  modems.   We
only have v.fast left."

     "No, not terbo," said Joe, rolling his eyes skyward. "TURBO!!"

     "Oh," replied Blue Ray, smiling slyly and giving Joe a knowing nod.  "Why
didn't you say so in the first place?" Blue Ray gestured to a door behind him.
"Come with me..."

     Joe  followed Blue Ray into the back room.  A lone swing-lamp cast a pool
of light in the center of the room.  Two men were standing there with an empty
chair.  One was a short, stout man  who  was completely bald.  The other was a
gargantuan of a man, standing at least 6' 6" and easily weighing  350  pounds.
Both  men  wore  dark  blue  three-piece suits and were adorned with much gold
jewelry.  Blue Ray locked the door  behind  him.  Joe walked over to the short
bald one.

     "Are you Egg's Head?"

     "Yes, that's me," replied the man. "I assume you are Joe Modem, correct?"

     "Uhh... Yeah, that's me. What am I doing back here anyway?"

     "Well,"  explained  Egg's,  "there's  been a slight change of plans." The
short man walked over to the  side  of the taller companion, gesturing to him.
"Let me introduce you to my boss, V.T.  Killer.  Y'see, he's always wanted  to
meet  you."  V.T.  nodded as the other man continued.  "And now he finally has
the chance." Egg's grabbed the back of  the chair and pointed the seat towards
Joe.  "Have a seat Joe."

     "Uhh...  Okay..." Joe wasn't very comfortable by the  idea,  but  he  saw
that he'd probably have little choice in the matter.

     The  two  started  grilling  Joe, asking him all sorts of questions while
Blue Ray took notes on Joe's answers.

     "Where were you on the night of the 24th," demanded Egg's.

     "Sitting at my computer."

     "Where were you last night at 8:00 P.M.," commanded V.T.

     "Sitting at my computer."

     "Where do you buy your suits,"  asked  Egg's  as he looked at Joe's nappy
attire.

     "Over the modem."

     "Where were you during the famous ACCESS network scam," asked V.T.  as he
roughly twisted the chair to directly face him.

     The ACCESS network scam?  Good lord, thought Joe, how do these characters
know about that?   The  ACCESS  incident  was  classified  Top-Secret  by  the
government and it certainly wasn't "famous" in any sense of the word.  If they
know about ACCESS...

     "Sitting at my computer," Joe lied.

     This  went  on  for some time.  After Joe had answered the questions, Ray
entered the data into his  sub-notebook  and whispered something to V.T.  They
had a quiet conversation and Ray showed him some data  on  the  sub  and  then
pointed  to Joe.  After thinking for a moment, V.T.  returned his attention to
Joe.

     "OK, Joe, we've confirmed it.  Using  the information you've given us, we
have determined that you are the famous,  secretive,  brave,  daring,  amazing
superhero ModemMan!"

     Bagged.   "I  don't know what you're talking about!  Lies!  Lies!  Who is
this `ModemMan,' anyway?"

     "See?  You're  denying  it,"  persisted  V.T.,  more  satisfied than ever
before about his decision.  "A sure sign that you're hiding the fact that  Joe
Modem  and ModemMan are the same!" V.T.  turned to his accomplices.  "OK boys,
dispose of him!"

     Blue Ray  called  in  two  other  previously  unseen  "salesmen" and they
dragged Joe into an adjoining room.  "No, wait!  You've got  the  wrong  guy!"
Joe  screamed  at  V.T.   as the others forcibly dragged him away.  "I keep on
telling you, I'm not  ModemMan!!   !!Help!!...  HELP!!!  HELP!!!!!!!..." Joe's
voice faded out as they forced him into the room.

     The room in which Joe was forced into was rather small, about the size of
a bathroom.  Joe tried the door, but there was no handle on his side - it  was
shackled  and padlocked on the outside.  The room was too small for Joe to try
taking a running shoulder-smash to try  and  force it.  There was a very small
window that, while having its glass broken, was unusable  for  Joe  to  escape
from  due  to  its size - about one foot square - and a rather imposing set of
steel bars that blocked the  opening.   The  only illumination in the room was
provided by the exterior security lights from the neighboring  building.   The
light  shone  through  the  bars  onto  the  floor of the room, giving the apt
appearance of a prison isolation cell.

     Well, thought Joe, they've got me.  How can I get them to believe I'm not
ModemMan?  As he was pondering  the  thought,  a shadow blocked the light into
the room and he heard a whisper.

     "Joe! Are you alright?"

     "What? Who's there?"

     "It's me, Pronto," came  the  voice  of  Joe's  co-sysop  and  ModemMan's
helpful sidekick.

     "Pronto! How did you know I was here?"

     "They  came  to get me too.  But I didn't fall for it, though.  I went by
your place and checked-out the chat  log  for the board.  That's how I figured
you were here and thought you might need some  help.   I  guess  you  couldn't
convince them that you're not ModemMan, eh?"

     "Yeah. Well, now what," Joe queried.

     "I can get you out of there!"

     "Yeah, How?"

     "Look at the vent directly above you."

     Joe looked up.  "I can't see a thing! You're blocking the light, Pronto."
     
     "Sorry, MM," replied Pronto as he shifted out of the way, allowing Joe to
see again.  He quickly spotted the  ceiling  grate hanging loosely by only one
screw.  "It leads to the store.  All you have to do is get  up  there  somehow
and climb through!"

     Joe  was  stymied.   There was nothing he could use as a step in the room
and the ceiling was too high  to  reach  by merely jumping.  "Somehow?  Do you
have a way in mind?"

     "Yeah," shot back Pronto, "I brought this  handy,  unbreakable  grappling
hook."

     "Great! Now how do I get it from you?"

     "Easy, here..." Pronto slips it through the window bars.

     "Kewl!   Thanks."  Joe  grabbed  the  hook  from Pronto.  "Get back to my
apartment and wait for me to get there."

     "You sure you don't need any more help here?"

     "No, Pronto. I think I can handle it from here on out. See you later!"

     "OK, ModemMan," replied Pronto.  "Oh,  here..." Pronto tossed Joe another
small package.  "It's your Tool Kit, boss.  Good luck!"

     The Tool Kit!  Joe smiled.  Now, he thought, I might be able to get some-
where.  "Thanks a lot, Pronto.  Now get outta here before anyone spots you."

     "You got it, MM," said Pronto. He quickly left.

     Joe shot the grappling hook in  the  direction of the vent.  It caught it
on the first shot.  He pulled himself up to the vent and opened it up.   Hmmm,
thought  Joe,  this  is going to be a tight fit...  I don't know if I can make
it...

     He made it.

     Joe stealthily climbed through the  vent  (at least, as stealthily as one
could expect travel through a  narrow  galvanized  steel  duct,  anyway),  not
knowing  where  in  the store it would lead to.  Finally, he saw the light.  A
bright,  fluorescent  light.   He  climbed  out  of  the  vent  and  dropped -
head-first - to the floor.  Fortunately, the glass display case was  there  to
break  the  fall.   Joe quickly righted himself and shook the broken shards of
glass from his clothing.  Joe  quickly  noticed  that  he was alone, the store
apparently deserted.  He also saw that the computer he'd  noticed  behind  the
counter earlier was still turned on.

     Joe walked over to the old 486 behind the desk and looked at the monitor.
Although  it was off, he could clearly see symptoms of burn-in.  How careless,
thought Joe.  They could at least use  a screen saver like "Before Light." Joe
opened up his Tool Kit, extracting a DIN-style jumper cord from the pouch.  It
was time for ModemMan to go to work.  Mentally switching into  ModemMan  Mode,
he issued the commands to his brain to fire-up the microcomputer chip that was
surgically  implanted  there  and  which  was  the heart of ModemMan's special
powers.

     He quickly unplugged the keyboard  from  the system case and inserted one
end of his special DIN cable into the receptacle  on  the  machine.   He  then
inserted  the  other  end  of  the  cable  into  the  DIN interface surgically
implanted into his right  ear,  first  removing  the flesh-colored safety plug
that covertly hid the receptacle from view.   This  would  allow  ModemMan  to
access the system simply by using his technologically-altered cerebral cortex,
thinking  his  commands  instead of typing them and flowing freely through the
system.

     Using only the powers of his mind, ModemMan's consciousness flowed freely
through the system, riding  through  the  circuit pathways inside the machine.
After quickly familiarizing himself with the internal structure of the device,
ModemMan started tinkering  with  the  computer,  deleting  a  few  files  and
changing  the  CONFIG.SYS  file.   He  then  loaded  up  the terminal program,
TearTerm.  Looking through the phone  directory he noticed many familiar BBSs.
They all seemed to be checked off except for his.  By the BBS listing  of  The
Brooklyn Blues there was one of those smiley face characters.

     After  doing  a fairly efficient job of messing up the computer, ModemMan
removed the interface and returned the cable to his Tool Kit, mentally exiting
his ModemMan Mode and replacing his ear  plug  as  he went over to the desk to
examine the papers lying there.  Hmm...  thought Joe, this is most disturbing.
It seems that they want to totally eradicate the whole existence of  ModemMan.
I  wonder  why?   Joe decided to go home, but before he left he added a little
note to the scheduling program:

     9:27 PM - ModemMan Destroyed - Body dumped in East River

     This'll throw them off  the  track  for  awhile,  thought  Joe as he went
outside, only to find that his car had been 'politely removed' by the  police.
He decided walk home.  He was so deep in thought about the papers and just who
this V.T.  Killer guy was that he failed to notice a long black limo following
him.   Gingerly  walking  up  the  steps to his house he noticed a note on the
door:
      
     Joe - Meet me at Quakey's Bar at 10:00 PM.      -Pronto

     Joe glanced at his watch.  9:45.  I  s'pose I'd better get there on time,
he thought.  Unbeknownst to Joe, the limo had pulled up in front of his  house
and  seemed to be waiting for something.  As he walked past the limo, the door
opened and a masked man stepped out.   The man grabbed Joe and quickly applied
a chloroform-soaked rag to his mouth.  He then threw the unconscious Joe  into
the back seat and climbed in.  The limo sped away to an unknown destination...

                              To Be Continued...

       In  the  next  chapter:  Is  V.T.  Killer still after Joe?  Who is this
mysterious masked man?  Why is Joe  being  abducted?  Will he ever see his BBS
again?  Find  out  next  month  in  the  next  riveting  installment  of  "The

I never thought I'd see the day        Two weeks later here I sit
when I would park myself and play      I'm hooked -- addicted -- I can't quit.
game after game, hour after hour       My wrist is stiff, my thumb is sore
collecting jewels and wielding power   from building up a record score.

The Sysop said the thing was great     My nerves are shot, my eyes are crossed,
most certainly not second rate.        my keys are loose, my mouse is lost.
I took his word and went on line       I think my fighting days are done,
downloading it, this game so fine.     in ninety games I've never won.

To venture forth I couldn't wait       Perhaps I'll download something new -
so I keyed in a fast baud rate.        my Sysop says he's got a few.
Then I unzipped it straightaway        This time I'll stick to golf or chess
for I could scarcely wait to play.     I just can't handle all this stress.

                      In summer, winter, spring and fall
                      we modem addicts place the call.
                      So please beware, I tell you true
                      it just might happen once to you.
