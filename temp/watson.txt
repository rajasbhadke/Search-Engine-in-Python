                             Watson Commands
                         ---------------


CTRL-B = BUFFER TEST PATTERN

  Pressing CTRL-B will fill the Buffer Location with the values $00-$FF. This i
s useful for performing tests and displaying the ASCII character set.


= = CONTINUOUS SCAN BACKWARD

  Causes WATSON to start scanning backward sector by sector. When any key is pr
essed, scanning will stop.


+ = CONTINOUS SCAN FORWARD

  Causes WATSON to start scanning forward sector by sector. When any key is pre
ssed, scanning will stop.


CTRL-Z = CONTINUOUS SCREEN DUMP

  See Exit & Setup Screendump.


C = CONVERT HEX/DEC & DEC/HEX 
  
  This command will take HEX and DECIMAL numbers and display them as HEX, DECIM
AL and SIGNED DECIMAL numbers. It will also allow addition and subtraction of a
n
y of the three forms of numbers.

To use this mode:

1. Press 'C'. The screen will clear below line 3, and the cursor will appear.

2. Enter the number you wish to convert. The number may be in any of the follow
ing forms:
   HEX-enter a number with a '$' in front of it, for example, $800.
   DECIMAL-enter the number as it normally appears, for example, 2048.
   SIGNED DECIMAL-enter the number with a '-' sign in front of it, for example,
 -12288.

3. Press (RETURN). The number will then be displayed in all three forms.

4. Press (RETURN) to exit this mode.


, = DECREMENT BUFFER

  Decrements the Buffer Location by 1 page in memory.  For example, if the buff
er is currently set to $0900, pressing this key will change the Buffer Location
 
to $0800.


CTRL-D = DISASSEMBLE WITH ASCII 

  Disassembles instructions starting at the Buffer Location. The ASCII values o
f memory will be displayed in the right-most column. This is very convenient fo
r
 looking at data areas in machine language programs.

To use this function:

1. Press 'B' to select the Buffer Location mode.

2. Select the Buffer Location where you wish to begin disassembly.

3. Press 'CTRL-D' to start disassembly.

4. Press any key to stop scrolling.

5. Press any key to restart scrolling.

6. Press 'Q' while scrolling to toggle between slow and fast scrolling.

7. Press (RETURN) to exit from this mode.


CTRL-T = DISPLAY ALL TRACK SECTOR LISTS

  Causes the disk to be scanned, and all sectors which could possibly be Track/
Sector Lists will be displayed on a map. This is very convenient when trying to
 
reconstruct a blown CATALOG.


CTRL-E = EXCLUSIVE-OR-BUFFER

  This command will EOR the entire buffer with any entered value. Certain progr
ams encode information by using this method, causing the information to be unre
a
dable. By using this command, these may be decoded.

To use this command proceed as follows

1. Press CTRL-E. The cursor will move to the upper left-hand corner of the disp
lay.

2. Enter the value that you wish to EOR the buffer with and press (RETURN)

NOTE: THIS COMMAND WORKS WHILE THE DISPLAY IS IN EITHER HEXADECIMAL OR ASCII MO
DE.


CTRL-O = EXIT AND OUTPUT CONTROL CHARACTER

  Pressing 'CTRL-O' will exit WATSON, and cause all control characters displaye
d on the screen to appear in inverse. This will work with DOS and normal progra
m
s. This is convenient to use when trying to find hidden control characters, etc
.


CTRL-P = EXIT AND SEPUP SCREENDUMP

  This command works mush like the normal Screendump command, only it may be us
ed form outside WATSON. After pressing 'CTRL-P', WATSON will return to DOS. Nor
m
al commands and programs may be run at this time, and a Screendump will be pref
o
rmed whenever a 'CTRL-Z' is pressed. This command is very handy when checking d
i
sk catalogs, listing programs, etc.


CTRL-F = FILE FOLLOWER

  Allows a file to be scanned sector by sector automatically, both forward and 
backward. This is accomplished by reading in the Track/Sector List for a file, 
w
hich is then used by WATSON to read in each sector of the file. This command is
 
very useful when a file needs to be inspected or changed.

 This command sets up the Track/Sector List for a file. After 'CTRL-F' has been
 pressed, it is then possible to scan the sectors using the left and right arro
w
 keys.

This command may be used as follows:

1. Set the track and sector (using the 'T' and 'S' commands) to the location of
 the Track/Sector List of the file that you wish to work with.

2. Press 'CTRL-F'. The Track/Sector List will be read, and a map showing all se
ctors in the file will be displayed.


. = INCREMENT BUFFER

  Increments the Buffer Location by 1 page in memory. For example, if the buffe
r is currently set to $0800, pressing this key will change the Buffer Location 
t
o $0900.


CTRL-K = KILL DOS ON DISK

  Frees the DOS tracks from the Track Bit Map. DOS normally uses tracks 0-2 and
 track 11. These are locked out on the Track Bit Map. On disks where DOS is not
 
required, tracks 1 and 2 may be freed, allowing up to 32 additional useable sec
t
ors.

  This command works exactaly like the Reconstruct VTOC command, only tracks 1 
and 2 will not be allocated. The new VTOC may be saved to the disk with the 'CT
R
L-W' command.


CTRL-L = LOCKOUT/LOCKIN SECTOR

  Toggles the status of a specific sector on a disk. A free sector will be lock
ed out, and a locked out sector will be freed.

To use this function:

1. Set the number of the track and sector, (using the 'T' and 'S' commands) to 
the specific sector that you wish to lock in or lock out.

2. Press 'CTRL-L'. The status of the specified sector will be toggled, and a ne
w map of the disk will be displayed.


M = MAP WITH FREE SPACE

  This command was included in THE INSPECTOR, but has been modified slightly. A
fter pressing 'M', a map will be displayed, an 'M' will appear in the upper lef
t
-hand corner of the map, in the form of F=XXX.


CTRL/SHIFT-M = PRINTER ECHO STATUS

  This command is used to enable the Screendump routine to either supply or sup
press carriage returns at the end of a line. Different printer interface cards 
e
ither require a carriage return to be supplied to it, or they supply their own.
 
The default is to have the routine supply carriage returns. If your printer out
p
ut is double spaced, pressing  'CTRL/SHIFT-M' will clear up the problem.


CTRL-S = SCREENDUMP

  Preforms a screendump when pressed. Anytime a printout of the WATSON screen i
s desired, pressing 'CTRL-S' will preform a srceemdump.

NOTE:AS IN OTHER PRINTER COMMANDS, SLOT 1 IS THE DEFAULT PRINTER SLOT. THIS MAY
 BE CHANGED TO ANY OTHER SLOT BY CHANGING LOCATION $2BA IN MEMORY.


Z = SETUP $300 TO TURN ON PRINTER

  In THE INSPECTOR documentation, it was explained how to install a routine at 
$300 to turn on the printer when 'CTRL-Z' is pressed. This is used for the HEX/
A
SCII and Nibble Dump commands. By pressing 'Z', a routine will be setup automat
i
cally to preform this function.

NOTE: THIS COMMAND DEFAULTS TO SLOT 1 FOR THE PRINTER LOCATION. LOCATION $2BA I
N MEMORY MAY BE CHANGED, USING THE EDIT COMMAND, TO ANY OTHER SLOT REQUIRED, AN
D
 THE NEW SLOT WILL THEN BE USED.


CTRL/SHIFT-N = TEST OVERDRIVE

  Pressing 'CTRL/SHIFT-N' will put WATSON in Overide mode. Normally for the Fil
e Follower, WATSON checks to ensure that the Track/Sector List read in is valid
.
 This mode ignores that test, in case the Track/Sector List is partially bad. U
s
ing this command, it is possible to partially use the File Follower command.


-> = READ NEXT SECTOR IN FILE

  Works in conjunction with the File Follower command. After a file has been se
t up by pressing 'CTRL-F', pressing the right arrow key will stop forward throu
g
h the Track/Sector List and read the next sector. If the Track/Sector List and 
r
ead the next sector. If the Track/Sector List is more than one sector long, sub
s
equent Track/Sector Lists will be read in after reaching the end of the current
 
one. After the last sector in a file is read, the apple will 'beep', signifing 
t
he end of the file.


<- = READ PREVIOUS SECTOR IN FILE

  This command works like the right arrow, only the previous sector in the Trac
k/Sector List will be read. Also, since Track/Sector Lists will only link forwa
r
d, and not in reverse, if the Track/Sector List is more than one sector long, i
t
 is possible to read only to the beginning of the current sector, and no furthe
r
 back. This will only be a problem when working in the second of further sector
s
 of a Track/Sector List. After reaching the first sector in the Track/Sector Li
s
t, the Apple will 'beep'. This only occurs if a file is 123 sectors or greater.


CTRL-R = RECONSTRUCT VTOC

  Reads in the VTOC from a disk, then rebuilds the Track Bit Map from the Catal
og Track. This is especially usefull when a catalog is reconstructed from a blo
w
n disk, or a file is undeleted.

This may be done as follows:

1. Insert the disk that you wish to be reconstructed in the drive.

2. Press 'CTRL-R'. A blank map will be displayed, with a 'R' in the upper left-
hand corner. The Catalog Track will be read in, and files will be displayed on 
t
he map, as they are reallocated.

3. After the disk has stopped, the new VTOC may be saved to the disk by pressin
g 'CTRL-W'.

NOTE: THE DISK BEING RECONSTRUCTED MUST HAVE A READABLE VTOC. IF THERE IS NOT O
NE ON THE DISK, THEN ONE SHOULD BE COPIED FROM A GGOD DISK FIRST.

NOTE: TO CHECK IF A VTOC IS CURRENTLY BAD, A MAP MAY FIRST BE READ FROM THE DIS
K. BY COMPARING THE MAP TO THE RECONSTRUCTED VTOC, IT IS EASY TO DETERMINE IF A
 
PROBLEM EXISTS.


ESC 1-9 = USER FUNCTIONS

  Just as the 'CTRL-Z' command will preform a jump to a subroutine located at $
300, ESC 1 through 9 will preform jumps to user subroutines. These jumps are se
c
ified by the bytes located at $3BE through $3CF. These locations are setup in n
o
rmal 6502 location, that is, with the low byte first, and high byte second.

The locations are as follows:

   ESC 1 - $3BE & $3BF
   ESC 2 - $3C0 & $3C1
   ESC 3 - $3C2 & $3C3
   ESC 4 - $3C4 & $3C5
   ESC 5 - $3C6 & $3C7
   ESC 6 - $3C8 & $3C9
   ESC 7 - $3CA & $3CB
   ESC 8 - $3CC & $3CD
   ESC 9 - $3CE & $3CF

  For example, if you wished to have ESC 7 do a jump to memory location $2000, 
you would place a $00 at location #3CA, and a $20 at location $3CB. This routin
e
 is convenient when testing machine language programs, using subroutines, etc.


CTRL-V = VERIFY THAT DISKS ARE ALIKE

  This command may be used to compare two of more disk, and display a map of an
y sectors which are not the same.

  The first disk that is read will set up a table in memory of sector checksums
. As further disks are compared, their checksums will be compared to the previo
u
s disk, and any differences will be displayed on a map.

This command may be used as follows:

1. Insert the disk to be verified in the drive.

2. Set the track and sector (using the 'T' and 'S' commands) to the sector wher
e you wish to begin verifying (this is normally track 0 and sector 0).

3. Press 'CTRL-V'. The display will clear, and a blank map will be displayed wi
th a 'V' in the upper left-hand corner. If this is the first disk read, then th
e
 map will remain blank. If there has been a disk previously read, any sectors w
h
ich do not compare corectly will be displayed on the map.

4. This function may be halted by pressing any key during scanning.

5. After the last sector on the disk is read, scanning will stop.


That'll do it for WATSON.....
