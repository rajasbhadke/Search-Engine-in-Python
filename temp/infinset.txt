InfiNet - The International Freedom of Information Network.

Setup Tips and Operation Guidelines.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting Up - Once your application has been accepted:

1. Obtain your node number, and the node number of your assigned net host.

2. Make up a list of which echoes you will be carrying on your system.  (You
   may always add more later).  Keep in mind the four REQUIRED echoes: INF-
   GEN, INF-SUGG, INF-SYS and INF-TEST.  Aside from those four, the rest of
   the InfiNet bases are completely optional.

3. Setup the echoes on your system, both in your bbs software and in your
   mail tosser's area manager.

4. Send a listing of which bases you intend to carry to your host (via
   netmail or e-mail), along with your node number.  Tell him you are setup.

   NOTE: Some hubs require use of AreaFix, an automated processing system
   which allows you to add or remove setup bases without the host-sysop's
   intervention.  It is generally suggested that you use this method anyway,
   as it greatly speeds up all phases of the host system's activity.  Read
   the enclosed text file "AREAFIX.TXT" for information on using AreaFix.

5. Post ONE test message in INF-TEST.  (This is the ONLY place on InfiNet
   that you should post a test message!  DO NOT post one in every base you
   are setting up!)  Scan for outbound messages, then force-poll your host,
   verifying that your front end sent the message.  If your host already has
   you setup, you may also receive your first packet of mail.

6. If all is working well, next time your system polls your host, you should
   receive a reply saying that someone received your test message.  If not,
   call your host and ask for assistance.

7. All done!  Welcome to InfiNet!  Sit back and watch the messages pour in.

Hints, Tips, and General Information:

 ú InfiNet is absolutely free.  The only cost of membership is any long-
   distance charges which may be incurred through polling for messages.


 ú If you wish to bring a new system into InfiNet, give the sysop this
   entire archive, as distributed (typically, "INFINET.ZIP").  Have him 
   fill out the enclosed application ("INFINET.APP"), and then return it 
   to Infinite Darkness, InfiNet World Host, at 69:100/100, or 1:369/23.


 ú InfiNet is fully ANSi compatible.  If you have a switch within your
   software to enable/disable ansi within each base, set it to On/Enable.
   InfiNet also allows the use of Forum-standard pipe color codes (indicated
   by a | (pipe), followed by two digits from 00-15).  It is recommended
   that you use a software which is also compatible with this popular
   standard.  If you run a *.MSG-type mail processor, you may request a
   utility which converts all occurences of these pipe codes into pure ansi.
   This converter may be File Requested at no charge from 69:100/100 or
   1:369/23 - simply request magicname "PIPE" (without quotes).


 ú Use of handles on InfiNet is highly encouraged.  Handles are NOT solely
   the domain of the computer underground; a good handle is an extension of
   your personality - it shows the world who you are, what you enjoy, and
   what you are like.  It is strongly suggested that all sysops enable usage
   of handles on their system (at least for THIS network, as most other
   networks disallow use of handles), and allow their users to post on
   InfiNet with their selected handles.  On SOME networks and online
   computer services, handles MAY be used as "walls" to hide behind, in
   order to facilitate the execution of a crime.  On InfiNet, handles are
   simply another route of free expression, and are a very simple way of
   having fun.  Don't hassle it.  Of course, you ARE free to use all real-
   names on your bbs - it is simply a recommendation.  We at InfiNet will
   NEVER force our required ideas upon other sysops simply because we think
   it "right" or "correct".  Feh.
