Compatibility: 64K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, KB or joystick


     Once more you troop into a packed stadium under the flag of your choice; but this time it's winter, the domain of skiers, ice skaters, and the bobsled. Successor to "Summer Games", Epyx's winter competition offers competition in seven exciting events; and, as always, the challenge is to 'go for the gold'.

     Showcasing smooth animation against colorful backgrounds, "Winter Games" displays approach TV screen realism. As in network broadcasts, you get second-camera inserts for closeup views in such events as ski jumping.

     Reflecting an excellent events mix and improved movement control, there are at least seven options in figure skating, ice dancing, and stunt skiing where technique is critical. Speed skating is simpler, testing rhythm and endurance; the bobsled tests reflexes; and in the biathlon's rifle shoot, the premium is on accuracy. Even more than the contest for medals, this challenge to master a variety of skills involves you in the games 'for real'.

     Among the best sports simulations, "Winter Games" is an entertainment bonanza playable as the Winter Olympics or on a single event basis. This is one you will surely want to introduce at your next gaming session (after a few days of practice, of course).
