     F-15 is a simulation of the high-tech F-15 all weather air
superiority and ground attack fighter, including all major
flight, weapons, and information systems.  F-15 also simulates
the modern air combat environment with numerous enemy aircraft,
radar guided missiles, infra-red missiles, air-air missiles, and
ground targets.  F-15 puts you in the cockpit of the world's
most advanced fighter airplane.

     To start off, pick a level: ARCADE, ROOKIE, PILOT, ACE.
Then pick a letter from A to G according to your desired
mission.
     Up to four players can participate.  Two players may also
play simultaneously, with one using the joystick to take the
role of pilot and the other the role of weapons systems officer

-AUTHENTICATION CODES-

     These are the codes that are listed on the title page.  It
is important to enter the correct code in order to gain access
to all flight and weapons systems.  (This is Microprose's silly
book protection.  It must only be done once after you boot the
disk.)  Here are the codes: (Example: "Authenticate (2)"  You
would type an 'A')
