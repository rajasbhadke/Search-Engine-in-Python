FEMINISM AND ANARCHO-FEMINISM :

- January 8th, 1994, Parisian suburbs : 15 people, members of the
association "S.OS.-Tout petits" ( Fundamentalist Catholics, Fascists...)
demonstrated at the Lilas Maternity hospital, were abortions are provided,
shouting "Here, they kill children ! ".

Fortunately, around 30 people had organised a counter-demo, to express
their support to the hospital staff and to the women inside. They
distibuted condoms and pills plaquettes to the "S.O.S -Tout Petits"
Catholics, stressing "A bas la calotte, vive la capotte !" (Down with the
calotte, up the comdom !). When they started singing anti clerical songs,
the prays increased on the other side, some Catholices even failed on
their knees !

The Lilas Maternity Hospital has been the target of several other
assaults for the last few months, from "S.OS.-Tout Petits" squads. Their
President Xavier Dor (Fundamentalist Catholic) has been sentenced for to
heavy fines. (See in the previous A-Infos).
