RACISM UPDATE 
 
Large numbers of "illegal staying foreigners" are kicked out from 
Japan under the Japanese heavy immigration control policy.
Media campaign of crimalization reinforces this policy against
"illegals". Recently, many poeple from China stow away to Japan 
with thier worn-out boat, for trying to have jobs, because of the 
economical gap caused by the Japanese imperialist policy. 
Most of them are arrested and accused of being criminals according
to violation of the "Immigration-control and Refugee-recognition
Act". After detained few months in jail, they are soon to be
deported. Media reports this matter sensationally such as  "big 
flow of bunch of criminals from poor China!". 
Image like "Chinese=criminals" spreads among people.  "Iranians=fake
telephone-cards dealer" "Japanese descent Peruvian worker=coming
to Japan for fund-raising campaign for Latin-American communist 
guerilla organisation" "Women from Thailand=prostitution,HIV-career"
All are on the same line of "racist campaign" brought by police 
and government authorities. Under these racist campaign, a concrete 
human-hunting of "illegals" has begun in every cities and towns.
"Foreigners" who are regarded as "unwelcomed", are arrested,
accused and deported. 
Chinese mafia, and Japanese mafia called Yakuza, are behind the 
Chinese stow away case. They earn money by labor transporting people
from China to Japan as a labor. 
Some of these "black money" is flowing to the Japanese rightist 
organisation as their funds of activity.

Subject; The judgement will be passed on Omori
 
We inform you that the sentence for Omori will be passed on this
15th, July. The judgement sure to be a death penalty. When this 
trial is concluded, there is no way for Omori to appeal any higher
juridical court. That means that an innocent person is taken to 
the death row by the fabricated trial.
We will have protest actions around the Supreme Court at the day
of the sentence, together with the Omori defense group, Prisoners 
Union and citizen groups for human rights and against the death 
penalty system. The meeting will be held also. We call on you to
send us solidarity messages for the meeting and to publisize this 
incident as we informed you before in our last e-mails in detail
about Omori case, in your publications. 
We censure the government crime that give a death penalty to
an innocent person. For further information, send e-mail to us. 
 
In solidarity,
