That was a Krackerjack's Autograph page? I thought it was one of those Rorsach
ink blots used in IQ tests. Oh well.

it was a kracker jacks auto graph page.  and as roman well knows CtC didn't get
their version out till today.  or do I need to buffer your posts from other
boards about how you guys released it at 5am this morning roman?  or maybe you
were just up modeming for a good time at that time.  we released it at about
10pm last night which is much earlier than you ever dreamed of putting it out.

roman.  face it.  You are lame.  CtC is lame.  and your board is one of the
biggest jokes/loser boards in the country.  A person only has to logon once to
figure that out....its not some mistical secret.

and ralph.  i'm glad you don't like the KJ page.  everyone else really likes
the animated pages...but then again.  everything is lame to you thats not done
by you isn't it.

Later
Alan...really getting sick of people who have to pretend and lie about
everything just so they can look like a HiP c00l pi-RATE.  like anyone really
cares.

If you're going to animate your page, then do it with style. That page was so
cluttered with text and shit it was unbearable. A good example is the t page of
Karateka. Simple and not overdone.

Mr. Death uplaoded the CtC crack of Times Of Lore around 8pm ot my board.
Then, I called The Crasher and we talked, he had it out and ready by 8, at
least.  I suppose I wasn't the first to get it, but I did get it fairly quick.
I got my first taste of Pandi*Net and REALLY liked it, alot better then
ProTALK...

the uploads to several boards around the country and you'll find that I started
uploading it at around 10pm to various boards.  I would have put it here but It
kept being busy...like right now i was just finishing some programming and
decided to give this place one more shot before sleep...was busy for about 5
minutes before wardialing finally got in.

and as for dox to times of lore.  Pete typed em up yesterday.  and they've been
out since then.

Neuromancer   4sides.  Yet another fine crack from USAlliance.

going up on the drive now.

I have proof here that all of alan's Bullshit about nueromancer is just that,
bullshit.  here is a post I constructed and put on the curse for everyone to
see:



Msg # :46/46
Title :Nueromancer lies...
From  :King Lear [Bobby]
Club  :Guzzler Klub
Date  :Thu, 17 Nov 10:55

As usual, another controversial release from USA:

From  :Blue Adept [Alan]
Club  :USAlliance
Date  :Wed, 16 Nov 22:47

another gNu ware from USAlliance.  cracked and released 2 minutes ago.  heh
exactly 10:48 pm.

Neuromancer    its a double hires GREAT game.  dox are being typed up and will
be done probably by tommorrow.  Its 4 sides.  and its already up on the US AE
West and East.  going up on deathstar when I can ever get through to it.

<< A key word in that sentence is that it is ALREADY up on the US AE west and
east.  Well, after reading that I called both boards and got on both of them
right away.  On west, I found:

089 TIMES.OF.LORE.1  30   Blue Adept (#2)       11/15/88   1200  Ymodem
090 TIMES.OF.LORE.2  30   Blue Adept (#2)       11/15/88   1200  Ymodem
091 TIME.LORE.REF    6    Blue Adept (#2)       11/15/88   1200  ProDOS/Ymodem
092 NEURO.S1         24   Blue Adept (#2)       11/17/88   1200  Ymodem
093 NEUROMANCER.S2   24   Blue Adept (#2)       11/17/88   1200  Ymodem

After logging volume 24 on west, only side 2 was there.  As you can see, side
1 was supposedly u/l, but it wasn't there.  Then, I proceeded to call US AE
East, and found no trace of Neuromancer anywhere.


Now, I have no problems with USA or alan or anyone in the group anymore, but,
when they say they have a ware out (4 sided) and they say that it is up on
some boards, and it trully isn't, that spells L I E.


Judge for yourself on this one....

ALAN-  Why not just tell the truth about your wares?  It probably would make
       things a lot easier on users.  I probably just saves a bunch of people
       a lot of time SEARCHING for the phantom ware that is supposed to be out?
       I really am curious as to why you would say things that aren't true?  I
       have suspected this sort of activity for a long time, and have been
       waiting for a chance to prove it.



This just goes to show that Ralph is right.  The ware is phantom and there is
no telling whether the whole thing is out or not.  Like I said, judge for your-
self on this one.

Well, the ware isn't "a phantom ware". When I got up and checked to board to
see how Alan's transfer went, there were indeed only two files recorded on the
new uploads and one of them wasn't even it the catalog. As soon as I noticed, I
called up Alan and told him how it fucked up. Well, I got the first side from
him and now side 1 & 2 are up. The game itself sorta reminds me of the
Lucasfilm games like Labrynith. Doesn't look too bad, though.

pcp didn'tlike neuromancer side 1 and doug was supposed to have uploaded it to
the east AE.  Nick called me earlier today and said that it didn't get their
intact to thewest so I sent it to him again direct.  I don't lie about warez.
Neuromancer was a simple >1< byte crack...i changed a 38 to a 18.\  no big
deal... and I had uploaded it to the US AE West and doug last night so it
should have gotten around.  but alas it didn't...and thats where you come in
b0bby.  Controversy comes from little gNu-wArEz kids like you who have nothing
better to do then point your little fingers at people who are doing the real
work.  So all you have to do is take your your modem.  shove it up your
ass...and shut your mouth/ass....and their won't be any problems.

and as for Club 96.  heh heh...i just heard about their >PACK< message on serve
and volley...  this is going to be phun.
