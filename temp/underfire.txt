
UNDER FIRE (War Tactics Simulation for 1 or 2 players)
Compatible: 64K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements:One disk drive, KB or joystick, (joystick required with II+), Mockingboard optional


     Somewhere a theatre commander has pushed your division's chit across a blue line on a map, thus securing a key bridge. But the bridge is five miles away, in German hands, and likely to stay that way unless your boys can knock out the enemy position on a ridge guarding the approach.

    "Under Fire" moves computer wargaming down to the small units level, where you can see the men and tanks. Three maps and nine scenarios are supplied; but a choice of objectives and provisions for building and arming each squad on a man-by-man, weapon-by-weapon basis greatly expand the actual number of situations. Add user-defined victory conditions and a design-your-own map making package (included), and you can recreate virtually any land warfare tactical situation of WWII.

     A typical game consists of several build/move/combat cycles. Three levels of map resolution ease planning; and your Apple takes care of combat results, sighting of enemy units, general bookkeeping, and firefight sound effects.

    "Under Fire" is an extraordinarily flexible wargaming environment. Slow combat processing is a weakness and even "simple" variations demand close attention to detail. So be forewarned: "Under Fire" is for dedicated wargamers only.
