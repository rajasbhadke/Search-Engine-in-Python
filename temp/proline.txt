                                 DESCRIPTION
 
 What Is ProLine?
 
 In the most basic description, ProLine is a networked electronic-mail and
 conferencing system.  But it goes a lot deeper than that.  It is the most
 complex and sophisticated message system ever created for use on an Apple
 computer and, quite possibly, for any small micro-based computer system.
 One would be in error to label it a "bulletin board system."
 
 ProLine was designed after the structure of a UNIX computer.  This allows
 for the most flexible implementation available for a remote communications
 system.  The UNIX architecture has proven to be an excellent environment
 for networked mail, public conferencing, and private electronic mail.
 
 Because of this unique design, a ProLine system is infinitely expandable
 and easily maintained with practically no operator intervention required.
 Adding a command or feature to a ProLine system is as simple as dropping an
 Applesoft BASIC program into a single directory.  This is perhaps the most
 exciting aspect of ProLine because it encourages the development of
 additional applications by interested programmers.
 
 At the heart of every ProLine system is ModemWorks, a communications
 programming language that aids Applesoft programmers in building
 modem-related applications.  The powerful features of ModemWorks provide
 ProLine with a sane, logical foundation which is easy to understand, and
 effortless to maintain.
 
 After reading the program specifications which follow, you'll see that
 there is something frighteningly awesome about this system.

                              ABOUT THE AUTHOR
 
 Morgan Davis began writing telecommunications software in 1983, and
 designed at least three predecessors to ProLine within three years before
 finally creating the system he was after.  Other BBS systems had come and
 gone in the wake of its birth, but ProLine continued to mature and expand
 for two more years.  And now, after nearly 70,000 callers (about 68 per
 day), Morgan Davis' beta-test ProLine system in San Diego has become one of
 the most-used systems, hosting callers from all across the nation and quite
 a few from Canada.
 
 His other credits include numerous technical research projects for
 CompuSoft Publishing's Learning BASIC book series, co-author of Mastering
 The Apple IIGS Toolbox from Compute! Publishers, member of the United
 Software Industries MouseTalk programming team, co-moderator of the Apple
 II conferences on the BYTE Magazine Information Exchange (BIX), and the
 author of ModemWorks and other utilities for Apple II computers.
 
 
 
                            ORDERING INFORMATION
 
 Version 1.1
 
 ProLine version 1.1 contains everything that you've read about (and a lot
 more).  It is available right now for $195.50 (U.S. funds).
 
 Living Legends Software realizes this is a major software purchase for most
 individuals, and there is just too much about ProLine to describe here.
 So, if you're interested in the system, you are strongly urged to call our
 ProLine node in San Diego at 619/281-7222 (300, 1200, or 2400 bps, login as
 "guest"), in order to see firsthand what it is all about.
 
 Living Legends also encourages you to call our information hotline if you
 require more details on areas not discussed in this pamphlet.  We want to
 make sure that ProLine is right for you and your particular application.
 
 As a special incentive, Living Legends is offering the first one-hundred
 ProLine owners free software updates when they become available.  Our goal
 is to establish a nation-wide electronic network of ProLine systems in
 order to provide low-cost distribution of mail and information.  (We hope
 to build an empire which surpasses that of a certain networked BBS named
 after a dog.)
 
 
 Terms
 
 Make your check or money order (United States funds) payable to Living
 Legends Software.  Sorry, no bank charge cards accepted.  Allow 3-4 weeks
