³ The History of IceNEWS ³ Jim (1@1)
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     About  1990,  after  seeing WWIVnews a few times, I wanted IceNET to have
it's own IceNEWS. At that time I asked IceNET's 1@12 (now called 'The  Sysop',
but  then  he was known as Slotcar Freak) to take on the task of preparing the
first issue. He was to work with Geot, 1@14 (no longer in IceNET), and  gather
articles  from  around the network. With this mission at hand, what he finally
sent back to me was a short paragraph, announcing the issuance  of  the  first
issue and asking for contributions

     Obviously,  this  was  not  much  of a start, but nevertheless it was the
first issue (though never issued). What Slotcar Freak had found  was  that  it
was  a  lot  more  work  gathering articles than he or I had thought. But this
pattern basically continued. Next on tap was Louhal, 1@10,  who  put  together
the first 4 or 5 actual issues of IceNEWS. The issues varied in length as well
as quality of content. It was about that time that I'd tried  to  formulate  a
purpose for IceNEWS, and I arrived at two objectives:

1.) Provide an electronic News medium for the sysops of IceNET to have a forum
    to present their writings in the news type format, so as to provide them
    an avenue for getting some recognition for their efforts on a national
    (now international) scale.

2.) Try to make each subsequent issue better than the last and target
    WWIVnews, the defacto standard for such a publication, as a benchmark
    to aim at in terms of quality.

     Burn-out struck after the first issues from Louhal, so he was quietly but
honorably  retired.  Upon a national request for an editor, Spelunker, 1@7653,
and The Fez (now Deacon Blues), 2@7653 offered to take on the job. About three
more  issues  came forth, all good and in my opinion and continuing the steady
string of improvement in the content  and  presentation  of  the  issues.  But
again,  the  burn-out syndrome struck. The pressure to produce a quality issue
each and every month was too great,  so  Spelunker  offered  his  resignation,
which I reluctantly accepted.

     Next  fodder  in  line  for  the Editor's spot was Special Agent, 1@7672.
Being a pillar of the BBS community, a very hard working person and sysop, and
one  of  the  smartest sysops I know, I was sure we'd finally gotten an editor
who would turn out dynamite issues month after month and all my worries  would
be  settled.  After  a couple of issues, though, there was a lag and BAM! once
again I had a burned-out Editor.

     But the light was starting to dawn on me...and when Deacon Blues came  to
me about 6 months ago with a renewed interest in IceNEWS preparation, the time
was right not only for a new Editor, but also a  new  way  of  organizing  our
work.  With  Deacon Blues the driving force, the IceNEWS staff was redeveloped
to include several new positions and the invocation of the concept  of  "team"
preparation  began.  A  regular  editorial  hierarchy  was  established,  with
Contributing  Editors,  a   Managing   Editor   for   each   month,   and   an
Editor-In-Chief.  Each succeeding issue would have a Managing Editor (M/E) who
would manage the current issue, then be able to  'relax'  the  next  month  as
another of the contributing editors took over the lead as M/E.

     As  of  this  issue,  I'm  hereby  appointing  Deacon  Blues to my former
position of Editor-In-Chief, and from this point on my  position  will  be  as
"Publisher"  of  IceNEWS.  Deacon  Blues  has certainly earned the position of
E-I-C, and under his leadership and  constant  attention  I'm  confident  that
IceNEWS  will  continue  to  expand  readership,  as  well as try new ideas in
content as well as presentation in the coming months.

     Also,  for  the  record,  the  following  former  participants   on   the
publication  of  IceNEWS  who  have  since gone to Editor's Paradise, I hereby
induct into the IceNET Hall of Fame, IceNEWS wing:

     Slotcar Freak
     Geot
     Louhal
     Special Agent
     Spelunker (still active as chief type-setter for IceNEWS)
     Jim

     I'll  still  write  from  time  to  time for IceNEWS, and contribute as I
can... so hail to the new Editor-In-Chief, Deacon Blues.  May IceNEWS  prosper
and thrive in his capable hands.

ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     This  May  issue marks the sixth edition of IceNEWS to be published since
the journal's internal  organization  was  re-structured  (starting  with  the
December  1993  edition).  In  these  past six issues, I feel that IceNEWS has
accomplished much. My fellow IceNEWS editors and I have  done  several  things
with  IceNEWS  that had not been done with the journal before. Things like the
inclusion of multi-part stories (Will's "Building A PC"  series,  Jack  Ryan's
"New WWIV Sysop Helpline," and Daarkhan's "Learning C Programming" series) and
original fiction ("The Adventures of ModemMan!" by Jot$ and myself).

     We did other things behind the scenes as well in an  attempt  to  improve
quality.  When  Jim  decided  to  re-structure  IceNEWS in October of 1993, he
wisely abolished the concept that IceNEWS could be put together by one or  two
people  and instead rounded-up a staff of people to handle the chores. For the
first time  ever,  people  from  outside  the  Buffalo  area  were  given  the
opportunity to become IceNEWS editors.

     With  a  true staff for the first time, IceNEWS buried the image of being
simply a "newsletter" (the word is banned in our  staff  room)  and  became  a
legitimate  publication, complete with an editorial hierarchy. The journal was
split into departments, with each editor  assigned  to  a  specific  interest.
People   from   Buffalo   (Jim,  myself,  Spelunker,  and,  later,  Louie)  to
Massachusetts (Will) to Florida (Jack) to California (Ima) worked  with  pride
together  with  other  writers  recruited  from  many other geographic locales
around IceNET to put out the best publication we could. There was  a  newfound
sense  of purpose and dedication that ran through the staff members that could
never have been achieved under the old way of doing things.

     IceNEWS also opened itself up more to its readers. We added a column  for
"Letters  to the Editors," something that IceNEWS never had before. To further
the lines of communication between the readers and the editors,  the  "IceNEWS
Beat"  sub  (subtype  IceNEWS,  host  @1) was created to allow readers to chat
directly with the editors themselves (and to pick up "inside" info on upcoming
IceNEWS stories). IceNEWS also started campaigning sysops to share the journal
with the other users of their systems as to allow for both maximum exposure of
the  journal  and  maximum  feedback  from our readers regarding how we put it
together.

     To get a better feel for reader  response,  I  wrote  and  distributed  a
questionnaire  asking  readers to tell us what they thought of IceNEWS to that
point (February, 1994). We were  quite  pleased  by  the  number  of  positive
responses  we  received  from those people who wrote back. Many wisely availed
themselves of the opportunity to tell us what they would like to see in future
editions  of  the journal. Many of those suggestions either already have been,
or are in the process of being, acted upon by us.

     Shortly after the questionnaire was published,  however,  responses  from
readers  to the IceNEWS staff regarding the journal dropped sharply. Input and
feedback from readers has dropped to near nil. In fact, this May issue is  the
first time since January that we have had any letters to print in our "Letters
to the Editors" column. A sad and alarming state, to be sure. The  editors  of
IceNEWS  need  to hear from you regarding how well we are handling our task of
providing you with a top-quality publication worth the time it takes  for  you
to read it.

     Tell  us  what  you  think about what we've done. Do you want multi-part,
comprehensive stories strung-out over a number of consecutive issues or  would
you  prefer to see an entire edition devoted to a single topic? Would you like
to see IceNEWS include "open" editorials from people regarding any subject  or
do you not like opinions with your network journal and want to see us stick to
straight-up technical and network-specific fare?

     What about creative fiction, like "The Adventures of ModemMan?"  Did  you
like  it? Did you dislike it? Did you even read it? Would you like to see more
stuff of this nature (maybe even a sequel to MM)? How about other  stuff  like
poetry? Do puzzles and games (such as the one in this issue) catch your fancy?
Or should we do as one reader suggested and simply do away with the Lite Bytes
department  entirely  because  it's just cheap filler to pad-out the issue? We
can't say either way unless YOU tell US.

     I cannot stress enough the need for our readers to keep in  contact  with
the  editors  regarding  the  future  of  IceNEWS.  If there's something about
IceNEWS that you like, or don't like, or want to see happen  with  IceNEWS  in
the  future,  we need to know about it. Please take the time to drop us a note
saying what you think. Who knows, your letter may even wind-up getting printed
as one of our "Letters to the Editors" in an upcoming edition.

     Without  your  help,  we  won't  be  able to continue to keep up the fine
quality of work that we have done for you, the readers, thus  far.  Show  that
you care about IceNEWS by getting involved and making your voice heard.

From Special Agent, #1 @7672:

Dear Editor At Large:

     I  am  making  my  complaints  known!  I  am  peeved,  how  dare you guys
contribute to helping Wayne Bell make us pay for all the  downloads  we  leech
off  of  Paragon  and  other  WWIV  BBSs.  I  call  this an outrage! I am very
disappointed that an organization such  as  IceNEWS  and  an  editor  of  your
quality would scoop so low as to do this!

     I am taking a class action suit out on behalf of all my leeching friends,
and when the 1099's come we will use them for toilet paper!!!!

Sincerely,

Special Agent #1 @7672

     PS!!! Great job on this months (April 94) IceNEWS! I  caught  your  April
fools  joke  as  you can see. <G> I am so glad that I gave up my editor job to
users as talented as yourself and Deacon Blues,  and  of  course  Martin,  Ima
Moron and others.

Keep up the great work, we may even see readership on the issues now!

From Rockhead, #1 @5350, to the IceNEWS staff regarding IceNET and IceNEWS:

     I  am  writing this to you to inform you of what a wonderful job everyone
has been doing at IceNEWS. I have only been is IceNET for about 6  months  now
and have to say that the effort put into this NET is tremendous.

     Regarding  IceNEWS,  I  think  this  is a great idea and wish to see more
people get involved with it. I  would  like  to  see  more  articles  on  WWIV
utilities.  I  would  also like to see a place in it for Mod Of The Month. How
about one column for on going C  programming  and  Pascal?  What  about  basic
reviews on new games and applications for computers? A technology column?

     I  would  like  to  say  "great  job"  to  everyone involved and hope you
consider some of these option I have given.  Good  Luck  in  the  future  with
IceNEWS.

Deacon Blues, Managing Editor for this issue, responds:

     Thanks for the kind words. I know that everyone here appreciates them. To
answer your questions and comments: IceNEWS is currently attempting to beef-up
our  editorial  staff  and  we're  always looking for people who wish to write
articles. We also have a  couple  of  stories  in  the  works  regarding  WWIV
utilities.  Hopefully,  these  endeavors will come to fruition within the next
month or two.

     Regarding ongoing C programming and Pascal articles, we have  managed  to
secure  two  more  parts to the ongoing "Learning C" column by Daarkhan, 1@ We
also hope to be able to provide future stories on  Pascal.  Your  ideas  about
reviews  and  a  tech  column  are also things that have been put under future
consideration for when we have more people who can cover all the bases.

     Mod-Of-The-Month was a regular  IceNEWS  feature  at  one  time  but  was
discontinued  as  of the December 1993 issue. It was felt by some of the staff
that the column was not needed due to the number of  Mod  and  Mod  discussion
subs  in the various WWIV networks. Another concern was the idea of publishing
Mods that could be read by non-registered sysops or  regular  users.  However,
the door remains open on bringing back a Mod-Of-The-Month column and, if there
are others who wish to see this feature reinstated, it could very well happen.

     If anyone else would like (or even  not  like)  to  see  Mod-Of-The-Month
brought  back  as  a  regular feature in IceNEWS, drop us some mail and let us
know.

     IceNEWS  asked  Daydreamer, #2 @4501, to write on her views about being a
female sysop:

     The question is... what is the difference if you're a female and a sysop.
Now actually I find that rather sexist, and it has been a thorn in the heel of
the Other Gender since the first asking.

     So here is my rendition of "Female Sysops" the Best of  the  Best.  <  so
there>

     Let  me  see,  what could the differences be, we all hit F10 for chat, F5
when we want the system, drop to DOS to find that elusive file, validate on  a
semi-regular  basis.  We  Mod  when  the  mood strikes us and forget where the
computer is located when we're having a bad day.

also confused as to how a "Mere" woman could possibly know any  thing  at  all
about computers and BBS systems, modems, archives, modding, and the like.

     After  helping  the  users setup their modems, defaults and finally going
over to check their computers, well, I am partially  offended  when  they  act
surprised that I even possess the knowledge to do these things. Then they want
to know why I do these things.

     Female sysops are a new breed, fighting for there right  to  co-exist  in
what  has  traditionally been a man's world. Women have moved right out of the
kitchen into the computer room, demanding  equal  time  on  the  keyboard  and
withholding favors and talents if the demands are not met.

     We  fend-off  the offers to take our minds off things that do not concern
us, making the effort not to destroy the ego of  the  asking  party.  Frequent
callers  are  rewarded  with  chat  time with the sys-person, we listen to sad
tales, glad tales and share in the joys and sorrows of our users. We  dispense
advice  when  asked  for  it  and offer a helping hand when a user is having a
difficult time. We have encouraged children to  clean  there  room,  do  there
homework,  and  then  modem, insuring that they will be able to call again. We
have worked on math problems, flow charting and  solved  the  mystery  of  why
little brother keeps deleting the callout directory.

     Now  a  word from a male sysop and how he feels about "the other gender."
Bear in mind that no threats have been made to ensure that there comments  are
favorable.  We  do  not fold and mutilate those whose opinions vary from ours.
Although, one of them may show a little frustration at the "did you  read  the
docs" question...

ones who came over and helped me set it up (as well as clean up  my  apartment

accomplished in two one-hour visits!

     I imagine she was getting kind of perturbed with me whenever I would call

a while, I should have realized  that  the  first  words  out  of  her  mouth,

     Hello  everyone!  This  is  your  friendly  neighborhood  Spider...err GC
checking in. Those of you in Group 1 have probably talked to me at one time or
another and some of you from other Groups may have had contact with me but for
those of you who haven't, how's it going?

     Well, things are fine here but quite busy this time of  year.  Like  many
other  SysOps  that  I know, I'm attending college full time and trying to run
the best BBS that I can. Unfortunately I've got to work too.  Well,  we  can't
all  have  it easy. Fortunately the semester is almost over and things will be
much easier for me this summer. (Thank God!)

     Anyway, I was asked to write a little article on  life  as  a  GC  and  I
figured  I'd  give  it  a  shot.  Here's an idea of what the GCs for IceNET go
through (and it's probably the same in all of  the  networks).  Those  of  you
seeking a job as a GC, keep this in mind. <grin>

     The  regular  things  I  handle,  or try to, are my own board. Most of my
users just log on to  play  games  or  leech  files  so  there  isn't  much  I
absolutely  have to do to handle things. But every once in a while I do end up
with someone who is interested in more. (What a relief!)

     Every day I get about ten  to  fifteen  messages  regarding  updates  for
systems  joining  the network, dropping out of the network, or needing changes
in the network files. These changes are usually  easy  enough  to,  do  but  I
usually  hold  off  a  couple  of  days so updates don't happen too often, too
quickly, or cause problems. Dropping systems and making  changes  to  the  BBS
information  and connections are the easiest to handle. New systems aren't too
difficult to handle, but, with IceNET growing as fast as it is,  sometimes  it
gets a little hard to keep up with.

     Every once in a while a rather new area grows large enough to warrant the
need for an AC to be elected. This is where the difficulties start to crop up.
I've  had  very good success rates with most of the ACs I've worked with. I've
only had an occasional episode of inter-area problems but  they  are  few  and
usually resolved well enough for things to continue normally. It definitely is
interesting 'training' a new AC. Form letters make a good teacher...sometimes.

     For those of you who aren't aware,  IceNET  now  requires  that  WWIV  be
registered  after  a  two  month trial period. I give unregistered systems the
benefit of the doubt and I don't always drop them right away. I always try  to
contact  them  to  see  if they've begun the partial payment plan. I find that
it's much easier to just extend the trial period instead of removing a  system
just  to add them back later (after they have registered). It's also much less
of a hassle to the SysOp(s) involved.

     On rare occasions, a dispute comes up in an area  and  it  falls  to  the
responsibility  of the AC to handle, unless the AC is one of the disputees. If
the AC is not able to come to a resolution, the disputees then come to me  for
assistance  in handling any problems. This is probably the most time-consuming
task of being a GC. These types of situations don't happen often but they grow
slowly  and  usually  aren't  settled very quickly. Fortunately most of IceNET
gets along rather well. <keep the fingers crossed folks!>

     Another side benefit of being GC is that  everyone  will  email  you  for
answers  to  various  questions.  I  personally take pride in things like that
since it makes me feel better that others can come to me  for  assistance.  It
helps  me  realize  that  the knowledge I've learned isn't going to be wasted.
These types of questions are the second most common things a GC receives  (the
first being updates).

     Well, that's about the best of things as far as I can relate. There are a
lot of things that a GC handles that aren't often noticed by  most  people  in
the  network.  If  you  can  imagine how much time this job takes up, I'm sure
you'd have an extreme appreciation for the work and effort that Jim, Filo, and
Random do to make WWIV and networking as good as it is. (Then again, Jim's got
some dedicated people helping him out...how unfair..<Grin>).

     When you get a chance, please  let  your  AC,  GC,  or  NC  know  what  a
wonderful  job you think they are doing. In Group 1, I can definitely say that
the ACs are doing a very good job and I'm pleased with the progress that  this
Group  has seen. If anyone has any questions or comments, feel free to drop me
a line. My mailbox is always open.

     Summer  time is just around the corner. That means nice weather is almost
upon us. Time to start thinking of the summer's BBS Events. What's that?  Your
area doesn't have BBS gatherings? Well, that is a shame. BBSers should all get
together every now and again just so we remember we are all real people at the
other  end  of  the  modem  and  not  just  some weird Artificial Intelligence
Projects (or lack thereof).

                               GETTING TOGETHER

     In the 716 area code  where  I  am  from,  BBS  Events  are  a  long-held
tradition.  I  have been BBSing for five and one-half years now and within the
first few months of my being involved, I had gone to a Kingdom  of  Renjevyick
Picnic.  The Kingdom was a great board from WNY BBS history that now is a dead
phone line in the sky. But I remember all the folks I met at that  picnic.  It
was a great time for everybody.

     Other  picnics were held that year. I went to them all. I met lots of fun
people that year. Rebo, Perseus, Pillsbury Dough Boy, The Piper, Jammin'  Joe,
Pirate, Eh ???/Zenith, IBM Monk, Far Side, etc. etc. I met a lot of fun people
that summer. Some of them have become close friends, others became friends for
a  while  until  we drifted apart. Others I haven't seen since, but I remember
then with fondness.

     In 716 the picnics evolved away from one board events  into  Western  New
York  All BBS Events. We try to involve all boards in the area in the Picnics,
Wing Dings, and other events.

                           WHAT TO GET TOGETHER FOR

     Many types of events have occurred in Western New York. We have  had  our
Picnics, Pizza-Movie Events, Winterfests, THITs, Splatball, house parties, and
"Wing Dings" (our Crown Jewel of BBS events).

                                  WING DINGS

     Wing Dings came about the year after I  first  got  involved  in  BBSing.
Buffalo is famous for Chicken Wings around the nation. Well, on the Kingdom of
Renjevyick and The Far Side (two boards both defunct now), a small band of  us
got  to  talking  about  who  could eat the most HOT Chicken Wings. All of us,
being the great HE-MEN we liked to think we were, started to brag about eating
hot wings. (I know, we seem to have been rather stupid. I don't deny it.)

     Well,  Perseus  got  to telling us all about some really really HOT wings
you could get at some local bar in Depew (a  small  village  just  outside  of
Buffalo).  We  all claimed we could eat 20 wings at this place Perseus told us
about. It was a small hole-in-the wall bar called "Sal's." Naturally,  Perseus
-  being the intelligent one among us (and having tried to eat a Sal's Wing in
the past) - dared us all to show up at Sal's and try eating one, let alone 20.

     Seven brave putzoids took the "Sal's Suicide Challenge," as it has  since
been  called.  The  brave  adventures  were : Perseus, Rebo, David C. (who has
since changed his handle to The Wizard), Gordon Sumner (who has since wandered
away from WNY BBSing), John Hardball, The Pillsbury Dough Boy, and myself.

     Due to a mix-up, only one of us got the "Suicidal" wings. That person was
myself (oh, lucky me). I managed to eat 8 of  those  Hellish  things.  I  have
never tried to eat another one since. I know when I have met my limits.

     It  was  a  fun  time  for  the  seven  of  us. We went back to PDB's and
goofed-off there for a couple of hours and then we  all  broke  up  again.  We
talked  about  the  "event  from  hell" on KOR and Far Side and others took an
interest in what we were talking about. They, like we had originally,  thought
there wasn't a hot chicken wing they could not master. Little did they know...

     We decided to hold a Second Wing Ding at Sal's. About 20-odd folks showed
up for Part Two. Among those that turned out for the second hellish experience
were  Kilometers,  The  Piper, Jammin' Joe, Zot, Swashbuckler, Eh ???, Pirate,
etc. etc., as well as the original seven of us.

     At this second Wing Ding Rebo managed to eat 20  of  the  hellish  wings.
And,  as Rebo later put it, he had trouble in the bathroom for a week. Rebo is
the only idiot to manage to eat 20 of the evil wings. (He can  be  reached  at
1@7660 in WWIVnet and 1@17660 in WWIVlink).

     At  Wing  Ding Three (the first Wing Ding to be called a Wing Ding), Csev
The Wanderer managed to eat 11. The top three folks at eating wings are  Rebo,
Csev,  and  myself. I titled the Wing Dings that myself. I said something like
"See you all at the Wing Ding later tonight," and the name of  the  event  was
born.

     Perseus  was  the  Wing  Ding  Czar for about three years. Perseus was in
charge of organization because it was his  original  idea.  I,  however,  have
since  inherited  the Czarship. I am about to hold my 5th Wing Ding myself. It
will be the 22nd Wing Ding in a long glorious history of WNY BBSing.

     Wing Dings are something we are very proud of, as  you  probably  already
guessed. These are sometimes other gatherings at local restaurant/bars. People
come out to eat dinner and spend the evening talking and meeting other BBSers.
For dinner we hype the Chicken Wings, but it is not a requirement.

                                   PICNICS

     Picnics  are  nice events for summer weather. We normally get together at
Beaver Island State Park three or four times over the course of the summer. We
then regularly have one End of Summer Picnic at Chestnut Ridge Park.

     To  hold  a picnic you need a large park. Someplace everybody pretty much
knows exists and knows how to get to. Don't choose some small,  out-of-the-way
park  that  very  few  people  know about. The park should have picnic tables,
shelters, big open spaces, parking areas and bathrooms. Other secondary things
to  look  for  are  things like baseball/softball diamonds, basketball courts,
volleyball nets, and playground equipment for the tykes. Also, try to  pick  a
place  in  the  park  that is easy for people to find where everybody can meet
when they first get to the picnic.

     Remember the Bring-Your-Own-Stuff mentality. Make it plain  to  everybody
that  food  and  drink  is  not  being  provided by you when you advertise the
picnic. Sure, you are a nice person, but I am sure you can't provide hot  dogs
for  100+  folks.  Remember to bring a grill to cook on, too, since some parks
don't provide them.

     In Western New York, we have gotten turnout for picnics to  push  175-200
folks at times. We advertise the heck out our picnics.

                              MOVIE-PIZZA NIGHTS

     Movie-Pizza events are another thing we like to do around 716. In this we
pick a movie to see and a time to see it. Then we  choose  a  time  about  two
hours  before  the  movie starts to meet a local pizza Joint, normally a Pizza
Hut. We meet, eat, and chat at the restaurant, then go see the film of choice.
Sometimes,  we even keep things going afterward by maybe either heading off to
a bar or to somebody's house afterwards.

     These are good to do with a funny movie, sometime like "Wayne's World" or
"Naked  Gun"  type  films.  Don't  try  this  with "Schindler's List." This is
supposed to be a fun event and a serious or weighty movie  can  really  put  a
damper on the fun.
        
                                    THITS

     A THIT (standing for "Thank Heavens It's Thursday) was an adult-type Wing
Ding  before there were Wing Dings. We have not had one in a long time  around
here.  Adult  themes may be something to stay away from anyway. BBSing already
gets a bad enough rap in the press with the "We're all Pirates and X-rated GIF
Makers"  guff  you see. Besides, there are usually many BBSers in an area that
are minors and would be unable to attend. One of the reasons that  Wing  Dings
and Picnics have been so popular is that they are open to all-ages.

                                 WINTERFESTS

     Ok, I'm a dude from Buffalo, and in Buffalo some of the more insane among
us Picnic in  the  snow.  Every  year,  Chestnut  Ridge  Park  is  home  to  a
county-sponsored Winter Festival near the end of January. It's always very fun
to get together at Chestnut Ridge and have snowball fights, go  sledding,  and
play  football  on a snow covered field... and not just touch football either.
We play a full-scale tackle/kill-the-enemy-brand of football. These are  great
fun,  but  it's  impractical  to  try  to  organize  one  of these in Southern
California or Florida or anywhere else that snow doesn't fare well.
        
                                HOUSE PARTIES

     House Parties can be pretty good fun. Around 716, the house party  expert
is  The  Piper  (16@7686).  House  parties do call for the host in question to
provide some supplies; like chips,  pop,  maybe  a  pizza  or  two.  It  isn't
uncalled  to  ask  the  quests  to  each  put  in a few bucks to pay the pizza
delivery person, though. You will probably want  to  keep  these  semi-private
affairs,  though.  Don't  advertise  on every BBS in your area "House Party at
Louie's". You don't want 100+ idiots showing up and burning the house  to  the
ground.  A  house party should be for the BBS Event "regulars" and others that
you are fairly-well acquainted with. Don't let just anybody  into  your  house
for a party that you don't know or haven't met before. Use simple common sense
on who you invite and don't tolerate "crashers" who may have found  out  about
your gathering through third-party word-of-mouth.

                            SPLATBALL (PAINTBALL)

     Splatball  was tried in WNY a few times. Rebo organized this three times.
It did involve collecting money up front, though. Also, one must pay  for  the
paintballs  that  they  shoot  over  the course of a session. Fees paid to the
facility usually only cover the field fee  and  the  rental  of  a  gun  (more
generous field owners may include one or two free tubes of paintballs with gun
rental). With prices ranging between $2.00 to $4.00 per tube of paintballs  (a
tube  contains  10  paintballs),  trigger-happy players can wind-up spending a
fair sum of money over the course of one session (a session  usually  consists
of  about  5  or  6 complete games, depending on the field). A session usually
lasts about three  hours  (depending  on  how  quickly  individual  games  are
completed).

     Splatball  is also dangerous (at least potentially) and you don't want to
be held liable by some insurance company because you let some real idiot  play
that  shouldn't  have  been allowed in. Deacon Blues used to play on a regular
basis for a couple of years and can tell several "war stories"  about  players
being injured on the field while involved in a game (including one incident in
which he was  involved).  Many  paintball  fields  also  have  a  minimum  age
restriction for players, so minors may or may not be allowed.

     Also, Splatball is a "dirty" game in that you are always either being hit
by paint or otherwise rubbing up against walls (when played indoors) that  are
splattered  with paint from stray shots. Splatball is also a game that usually
requires a fair amount of running. By the time that an evening's play is over,
participants  are  usually  too  sweaty  and  dirty  and  tired to do anything
afterward but go home and count the bruises.

                   WHAT TO CONSIDER BEFORE GETTING TOGETHER

     There are a few other things to consider about BBS Events before actually
getting one together.

     Advertising  was  something  I  brought  up  a  few times in passing. You
advertise a BBS Event by posting messages about it. In 716  we  have  the  716
General  Chat Subs in IceNET and WWIVnet as well as a few Event Planning Subs.
We post the messages about Wing Dings  and  picnics  on  these  subs.  I  also
normally  e-mail  a  copy  of  an add to each 716 IceNET, WWIVnet and WWIVLink
Sysop and ask him to tell his/her users about the event.

     You also should consider how many people you want to attend a  BBS  event
before  you start an advertising blitz. If you want over 100+ people to attend
(which a picnic could easily support) then it pretty much does not matter  how
much  you  advertise  it. You may not want more than 50 people for a Wing Ding
(or other restaurant or  bar-dependent  activity)  though.  In  that  case,  I
normally  only  advertise  on  IceNET and WWIVnet. We have other various small
networks around (QuadNet, DragonNET, MicroNet, etc.) and you will  reach  more
people  by  advertising  on  such  nets.  But  that means you will get largest
attendance as well.

     Sometimes you don't wish for a huge attendance. If you  think  that  this
sounds  contradictory  to  the very idea of getting together, let me relate to
you some of the problems that we have had with our Wing Dings.

     Two problems we ran into with Wing Dings had to do  with  money  and  the
place  we  hold  the event. We started out holding Wing Dings at Sal's, a very
small mom-and-pop-type bar with a capacity of  about  25  people.  After  word
spread  around  town  about the Wing Dings, attendance skyrocketed. We quickly
outgrew that small place. Sal's was good for an event that would get 25  folks
at the most. We have since gotten 125 at some Wing Dings recently. In the end,
Sal kicked us out because we simply over-ran his small establishment (and  put
a serious hurt on his very limited staff).

     We had to locate another place to hold the event. We did... but they only
let us stay for two gatherings. Some folks got a little rowdy and tossed  some
birthday  cake  around  and made a general nuisance of themselves. So, we were
tossed out of our second home.

     Since then we have been  asked  to  leave  about  five  places.  We  have
Hemingway's,  a  nice bar in downtown Buffalo that likes us now... but we will
probably only be there one or two times more. Trying to find a new  how  right
now.

     The  main problems we have had with restaurants are folks being rowdy and
the restaurant wanting us to have up-front money. Restaurants  want  up  front
money for some good reasons though. 1.) People sometimes stiff on bills from a
group of folks (another reason we were asked to leave one establishment).  2.)
People  from a group sometimes cause damage (as evidenced by the cake-throwing
incident). 3.) It is easier to get 300 bucks from the group and then put out a
buffet of 300 bucks worth of food.

     Up-front  money  is  a  bad  idea  normally.  Why?  Because  it can cause
problems. If you have to ask people to put in $4 before hand some complain  "I
only  ate  $3  worth  of  food  while  he  ate  $7  worth of food" and similar
complaints. It is also easier for people to manage their own bills. If you eat
$5 bucks worth of wings, then you pay for $5 bucks worth.

     Another  aspect of concern to the owners of the establishments we've held
Wing Dings at is the issue of under-age drinking. You can't have kids  showing
up  a  Wing  Ding (or picnic, or anything else, for that matter) and illegally
drinking. This issue also cost the Wing Dings a home when someone of legal age
bought  a  minor  a  drink  from  a  bar.  Due  to this (and even prior to the
instance) we (those of legal age) watch for this like  hawks  around  716  BBS
Events.  Some of us take a look every now and again at what folks are drinking
if they are young. It might not  be  something  you  want  to  do  but  it  is
something  you  have to look out for. If some kid gets arrested for DWI on the
way home from a BBS Event... the  police  and  the  parents  might  have  some
questions to ask the Organizers and the Sysops.

                            WHAT TO DO AT AN EVENT

     Other  little  things  we do... We have a sign in sheet where people sign
their handles to a sheet so we know how many showed up. That is how we know we
had 175+ for some picnics and a 125+ for some Wing Dings.

     I  normally  go around trying to meet everybody as well. Some people just
want to talk to a few people they already know. Others, like me, try to get to
know  and  exchange  a few words with everybody. Remember, the idea is to meet
people. The saying we have for our events is "Come  out  and  meet  the  faces
behind the handles," and that's what everyone should try to do.

                                  CONCLUSION

     Well,  that  is  all  I  can think of to say about Western New York's BBS
events. We are going to have a lot of them this  summer.  I  hope  some  other
parts  of  the  country also have BBS Events. One of the ideas of BBSing is to
meet more people. Local, regional, and national BBS Events can go a  long  way
in helping to do that. They are great fun. Who knows, WWIVCon '94 may just end
up being one huge BBS Event from Hell. Lets hope so.

     I  was  approached  by  the  IceNEWS editorial staff and asked if I would
write an article on how to protect WWIV. Actually, I was  asked  to  write  an
article  explaining  why WWIV is hard to hack. I've given it some thought, and
I'd thought I'd fudge a bit write a little about the latter, and a lot on  the
former.

     Why is WWIV hard to hack? It has to do with the years of development both
by WWIV Software Services, and independent modders  (people  who  modify  WWIV
source code) such as myself.

     You  see,  in  the  past,  when  a way to hack WWIV was found, fixes were
released, and instructions were given so as to close those holes in  security.
As  time went on, those fixes and instructions have become in integral part of
WWIV coding.

     For instance. Some  people  still  believe  that  you  can  use  the  ol'
????????.???  filename  trick  in  the archive extract section to allow you to
upload a rouge program that ultimately will allow a hacker access to DOS,  and
therefore  your entire machine. Well, when this particular hack was found, the
steps were taken to make sure it  didn't  happen  any  more.  Indeed,  try  it
yourself!  You'll find that WWIV no longer accepts ????????.??? as a filename.
This trashes that hack.

     Ultimately, all hacks are squashed in this manner. As new ones are found,
if they are found, they will be corrected immediately.

     Now,  for extra protection just in case someone manages to hack your BBS,
here are steps you can take to 1) stop any hack attempt before they are  done,
and  2) limit any damage done. They are arranged by levels, from those who run
stock WWIV, to those who mod heavily.

Stock WWIV protective steps:

1.  Back up all of your data files to tape or diskette nightly.
    [This way, if you are hacked, and your BBS is trashed, you can be back up
    in a matter of hours.]

2.  NEVER grant 255 security levels other than those people you absolutely
    trust.  Do not grant 255 to people who are just good friends.
    [Ya never know when things can go sour.  And the easiest way to hack a
    BBS is to have a SysOp account.]

3.  Ensure that files that are called by the BBS are called in the following
    manner:

    {drive}:\{path}\{filename}.{extension} {command line switches}

    For example, for a file transfer protocol:

    c:\files\dsz.exe port %2 speed %1 ha slow rz -mrr %3

    Or for a archiving program:

    x:\morefile\evenmore\pkunzip.exe -o -e %1 %2

    [How can a rouge program called DSZ.COM run if the BBS calls DSZ.EXE
     specifically by path and filename?  It can't]

4.  Limit all uploads to one directory.  Make it a SysOp-access only
    directory.
    [I know this can be a pain in the rear.  But this way no one can mess
     with a programs internal files if they can't get to it once uploaded.]

5.  Make things doubly secure by TELLING your transfer protocols to transfer
    only into the SysOp directory.  HS/Link allows you to do this in its CFG
    file.  If I remember correctly, DSZ/GSZ allow this by environment
    variable.

6.  Use a nightly batch file to check the files in the SysOp's dir.  You
    can easily scan for viruses, recomment, rearchive, etc. these files
    automatically while you sleep.  Have it REBOOT the machine when done.
    [Doing this allows you to search for viruses.  If found, you can have
    most scanners simply delete the program, and make a log entry.  You
    don't get the virus because the program was never run.  Recommenting
    removes any possibility of ANSI bombs remaining in the file (rebooting
    removes the chance of them ever taking effect).  Use Norton Utilities
    BE REBOOT command to do the job, or some other rebooting program.  I
    also take this time to defrag. the HD, GIFLITE .GIF files, and a few
    other chores.]

7.  Never, never, never run any program that looks suspicious, or, that a
    person you don't know keeps pressuring you to run.  Most legit shareware
    program are very well documented.  Most all have .REG/.DOC/.DIZ/et al
    files.  If you find a file that simply has an .EXE or .COM file in it,
    it is safer to just delete it.  Besides, 99.99999% of the time it is crip
    anyway. [This keeps you from inadvertently hacking your own BBS by running
    a virus or trojan file.]

8.  Write protect all of you .EXE, .COM, and .BAT files that you use to run
    the BBS.  Use the ATTRIB command to do this.
    [This keeps important executable files from being overwritten by
    anything, possibly a rouge program.]

9.  Change the name of ATTRIB.COM, FORMAT.COM, FDISK.COM etc... in your DOS
    directory. Just make 'em something else you can remember.  Better yet,
    copy them to a floppy and delete them from the HD.
    [How can a person format your HD if they have no formatting program, no
    way to repartition, the HD, or un-write protect any programs?]

10. Do not use a personal P/W that is easy to figure out.  Do not use an INIT
    password that is obvious.  Using a the WWIV's random personal password is
    a good idea.  Do not use that password, or anything resembling it on any
    other BBS.  Pick an INIT P/W from the funny papers at random.
    [Don't make it easy on the potential hacker by "giving" them your P/W!]

11. DO NOT INSTALL *ANY* program that requires the use of DOORWAY unless you
    are intimately familiar with that program's drop to DOS features, and
    DOORWAY's command line structure to limit those DOS calls.
    [Do not let your ignorance grant an easy "back door" into your BBS.]

12. Do not install any online game that remotely looks suspicious.  Remove
    any that crash regularly, for unexplained reasons.
    [Door programs, now, are THE #1 way for anyone to hack a BBS.  Why?
    Because unless the SysOp wrote the door himself, he has NO IDEA how it
    written, and what weakness/back doors may be installed in it. Personally,
    I try to stick to well known door authors and popular games that a lot of
    SysOps run.]

13. Only allow people you TRUST have access the BBS computer, or any machine
    where you may have WWIV source coding.  Disconnect the keyboard if having
    a BBS party in your home when not at the machine, and people you don't
    really know are present.
    [Simple.  An unscrupulous person would love the opportunity to get your
    passwords, and source code hack work-arounds first-hand.]

14. Tell family members not to press F9 or change a user's access while that
    user is online.  Unless, of course, they are SysOp's too :)
    [Don't let the potential hacker talk your loved ones into letting them
    into your BBS!]

     Light modification tips. (You must be a registered WWIV owner,  with  the
source code, and own a copy of Borland C++ or Turbo C++ to do these.)

1. Rename the //DOS command in BBS.C, IE:

    if (strcmp(s,"Q1W2E3R4T5Y6")==0) {     // <<< CHANGED DOS TO Q1W2E3R4T5Y6
      if (checkpw()) {
        write_inst(INST_LOC_DOS,0,INST_FLAGS_ONLINE);
        sysoplog(get_stringx(1,6));
        shrink_out(getenv("COMSPEC"),1,1,1,0);
        topscreen();
      }
    }

   [Who's gonna run //Q1W2E3R4T5Y6 to drop to DOS?]

2. Add a second password in XINIT.C:

    sprintf(s,"WWIV_NET.DAT");
  unlink(s);

  randomize();

  if (!restoring_shrink)
    catsl();

  write_inst(INST_LOC_WFC,0,INST_FLAGS_NONE);

     strcpy(syscfg.systempw,"SLURPEE"); // << THIS IS THE NEW SYSTEM P/W }

 [With this, the P/W in INIT will only be used to access INIT.  This makes
 it so that in order to even log on as a 255 account, you *MUST* now this
 new P/W.  All internal commands need this one as well.  The beauty is that
 it does not appear in any data file anywhere.  So if you are hacked, the
 hacker will know your INIT password, but not the one required for BBS
 access!]

More advanced source code tactics.

1. The most common place WWIV seems to be hacked at is the archive commands
   in the file transfer section.  I believe them to be quite safe, now (I
   haven't heard of a single legit hack for 4.24 anyway).  In any case, you
   can remove the entire XFERTMP.C file (save two functions) along with the
   calling statements in BBS.C/XFER.C.  This not only removes the supposed
   "weak link", but saves on memory.  I've never had anyone use them anyway.

2. Do not introduce any coding that can access a disk drive or CDROM that has
   a possibility of not answering up properly when called.  For example: if
   you install my SPV-042E.MOD modification, and you tell it to look for a
   CDROM on drive F: and you have no drive F: (or you do have a drive F:, but
   no CD in the drive), and a person types //CDROM, you're gonna see a DOS
   level error condition generated: (A)bort, (R)etry, (F)ail?  {OS/2 just
   plain freaks out here!}  This can lead to an eventual drop to DOS.
   Although the user will not have any access at the DOS prompt, it is not a
   comfortable place for your BBS to be.

     Again,  unless  a  SysOp  "helps"  the would be hacker in some way, there
really is no way into DOS from WWIV  except,  possibly,  door  programs.  Even
then,  a  legitimate door author would not deliberately write in a DOS drop of
any kind. If it were ever found out, they'd be dead in the BBS world.

     I've been doing this for 13 years now, and I've never  had  a  successful
hack attempt. A little work and common sense goes a LONG way!

³ What's Wrong With WWIVMAIL/QWK? ³ Ima Moron (1@9661)
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     After  hearing  about  the  row written about WWIVMAIL/QWK on the WWIVNet
subboards I thought I'd remove the mystery surrounding one fine  BBS  utility.
Some  time ago, like around WWIVMAIL/QWK 4.22 I wrote Micheal Lieb, the author
of the utility, some snail mail in which I said it would be a long time before
I  sent  him $25.00 of my money. I thought at the time Mike did a lousy job of
the documenting file included with the software. Mike also  practically  never
answers  E-mail.  Well,  for  as long as I've kept track of his QWK program he
hasn't. He likes to have questions posted on the WWIVMAIL/QWK support subboard
and respond publicly to any questions about it.

     But  I  was wrong to knock his QWK system, since I'd never taken the time
to post on that subboard and allow Mr. Lieb an opportunity  to  ex  plain  the
setup  of  his  QWK  door.  Since  then  I've acquired some QWK savvy and I've
registered the utility.

     In the beginning, Michael Lieb created a limited QWK  compatible  message
transferring   utility  in  which  he  attempted  to  allow  BBS  users  total
configuration of the utility on the first screen. It took Mike quite  a  while
to  realize  that  people  who  use  utilities  don't want to think, they want
instant automated access to QWK or whatever, and it  must  be  cool!  He  also
learned  that  many  sysops out there are still in primary reading studies and
that he shouldn't substitute a scientific paper for a documentation file.

     But enough of my chastising Mike, I've written this article to praise the
Ceasar  of  WWIV-QWK, not to bury him. Below I'll clearly state how to install
WWIVMAIL/QWK version 4.54 with WWIV version 4.23, the current versions of both
of  the  softwares.  If  you  wish,  you  sysop  may  install it and judge for
yourselves Michael Lieb's work. Below that,  I'll  add  some  out  takes  from
Michael Lieb's WWIVMAIL.DOC file wherein he explains items of interest to OS/2
users and to sysops running modified USSERRECs.

     Included in the archive is two files that you will need to place in  your
WWIV  or main BBS directory, wwivqwk.exe and wwivmail.cfg - do it. Now call up
wwivedit with the //edit command and  load  the  wwivmail.cfg  file,  remember
this;  you must edit the file to include 23 lines and the placement of data on
the correct line is critical! Below is the layout of WWIVMAIL.CFG;

LINE1:  The CITY/STATE where your BBS is located.
LINE2:  Maximum TOTAL messages that can be downloaded at 300   Baud.

        File EXISTENCE checked? 
        (LEAVE BLANK TO IGNORE) 
        If you put a NO here, the existence of files on your
        system will not be checked; therefore, the user will never get
        a N/A filesize. This is handy if you have a CD-ROM drive
        because seeking file existence is slow and can take a LONG
        time. If you have a CD-ROM, I have been told(I don't have one)
        that this MUST be set to NO. If you don't have one, just leave it
        blank.
LINE21: 3    
        LINE #21 DEFINITION
        Number of GOLD pieces given to a user for each uploaded message
        through WWIVMail/QWK. Leave blank if you don't use GOLD on your 
        system or don't wish to reward the user. (You could also put 0
        here if you wish).
LINE22: NO   
        LINE #22 DEFINITION
        Add WWIVMail/QWK Tagline to all Uploaded Messages? 
        (LEAVE BLANK TO IGNORE)
        This option is only valid if you are a registered WWIVMail/QWK
        Sysop. This will tell WWIVMail/QWK NOT to add it's tagline to
        the end of all uploaded messages. This is ON by default and
        will continue to be active UNLESS you place a NO at line 22
        of wwivmail.cfg.

        I have added this feature because of several requests but, I would
        really prefer that, after you register, you might be proud of
        that fact and WANT to have the tagline say that you are registered.
        The choice is yours. At least it's there!
LINE23: .QWK/.REP Packet Name..(Up to 8 ASCII Characters)
        (LEAVE BLANK TO IGNORE) 
        The name of the .QWK packet for your BBS is created using the BBS 
        NAME field from your INIT.EXE(config.dat). The packet name is based 
        off of the first eight characters, with any blanks being replaced by 
        underscores. 
        Example: Das_tube.qwk

     That's the whole configuration file, count the lines and get  the  number
of lines correct.

Start the BBS and go into //chainedit: Make it look just like this!

        A. Description  : WWIVMail/QWK v4.54 .QWK Mail Door
        B. Filename     : WWIVQWK.EXE
        C. SL           : 10            /* your choice */
        D. AR           : None.         /* your choice */
        E. ANSI         : Optional
        F. DOS Interrupt: NOT Used
        G. 300 Baud     : NOT Allowed   /* your choice */
        H. Shrink       : Yes
        I. Disable pause: No

Edit either AUTOEXEC.BAT or your BBS.BAT to include these three set commands;

     set wwivmail=c:\wwiv\temp\ set dszlog=c:\wwiv\dszlog set dszport=1 /* put
the number of your active comport behind the = */

     Now go into INIT.EXE and make sure that these are the command strings for
your  PKWARE (ZIP) archive entries, make sure that you're using PKWARE version
204g. If you aren't your users reply packets  might  make  a  mess  since  the
latest version of pkware is version 204g;

PKZIP
   PKUNZIP -v >NULL %1    < this is the list command using pkware v204g
   pkunzip -e -o %1 %2
   pkzip -a %1 %2

ARJ
   arj l %1
   arj e -jyn %1 %2
   arj a %1 %2

LZH
   lha l -m %1
   lha a -m %1 %2
   lha e %1 %2

     That's  it,  just remember to create some bulletins and name those on the
correct lines in the WWIVMAIL.CFG file and inform your users that they need  a
QWK  packet  reading utility like OLX-TD or SPEED130. OLX-TD is about as fully
operational as any begger-ware I've ever seen, it's also a fully  configurable
and automated offline reader. I like it!

     Other  features such as source code or OS/2 compatibility information are
included in the wwivmail.doc  file.  If  you  have  a  modified  userrec  I've
included Michael Lieb's instructions below;

H) What Do I Do if I have a modified USERREC?

     Although  I have felt in the past that registered user's did have userrec
support, since they legally got the source code;  but,  some  people  couldn't
evaluate  the  product before paying for it. In order to fix this, and give my
product  equal  advantage  with  any   competitor's   (current   or   future),
WWIVMail/QWK can now be compiled and linked via an object-oriented approach to
match any userrec changes that you may have made. Any changes to the BBS  file
structures,  other  then  the  userrec,  however,  will  still  require you to
register and get the source code. I hope by adding this feature  that  I  will
have  satisfied  many  of  your  needs and will have greatly enhanced the use,
compatibility and quality of the product.

     REMINDER: You ONLY need to do this procedure if you  have  modified  your
user.lst.  If  not,  use the wwivqwk.exe included in this archive file. It was
made EXACTLY  the  same  way  as  you  are  going  to  make  yours  using  the
instructions  below  (except  with  a  stock  vardec.h)...I  used  the qwk.lib
included in this package just as you will!

     Needed  Files:  =============  QWK.MAK  MAKEFILE  TO  COMPILE  AND   LINK
WWIVQWK.EXE FROM QWK.LIB QWK.LIB WWIVMail/QWK LIBRARY TO LINK WITH USERREC.CPP
USERREC.H HEADER FILE FOR USERREC.CPP USERREC.CPP .CPP FILE  TO  COMPILE  WITH
YOUR VARDEC.H AND LINK WITH QWK.LIB

        Below is Michael Lieb's instructions to OS/2 users;

E) WWIVMail/QWK and OS/2 2.0-2.1
   This information has been provided by:
   The Doorman - The Thieves Market - (803) 723-7254 - 1@8301 WWIVNet

WWIWMail/QWK will run correctly under OS/2 if you keep these 2 things in mind:

1) Leave ALL COM PORT settings to their defaults, except, turn ON the COM_HOLD
   toggle under the DOS Applications settings. (The default is OFF.)

2) Do NOT turn on COM_DIRECT_ACCESS..if you do, WWIV and the Network will lose
   characters at high speeds, as will WWIVMail/QWK.

If you have any questions about these comments(or additions), please contact
The Doorman at the above address or send issue of them to me.

             ----- Instructions And Suggestions To Modders ------

     If  you  choose,  you  may allow WWIVQWK access to your users immediately
after the users logon by adding the CALV002-C.MOD. You may also add one of  my
mods,  an updated Dr. Schizophrenic 1@6955 mod now called IMA001.MOD (this mod
creates an enforced post to call ratio over your chains), and  when  installed
with  WWIVQWK.EXE  and  the  CALV002-C.MOD  it removes all of your user's lame
excuses for not posting.

     I've  included  both  of  the  above  mentioned  mods,  which  are  fully
operational on Das' Tube BBS! located in lovely Redding California.

Back up your source code.  I use the "incremental backup" procedure,
which utilizes the archive bit in the file attributes.  If you want
info, read the PKZip docs or E-mail me.  It works great and saves a lot
more time than just PKZIP BACKUP.ZIP *.H, etc.

      This mod was originally written by Dr. Schizophrenic 1@6955 for version
      4.21, as time had gone by I (1@9661) have kept the mod up to date
      through the version changes. The purpose of this mod is to force
      your users to maintain their post to call ratio as you have set the
      ratio in init.exe, or deny the user access to the online games. When
      the user is denied access the mod will inform them why they were
      denied chain access.

      Code Legend:
      /*==*/ = Existing Code as in WWIV version 4.23

/*    There is an option to allow a new user "five free logons" if you choose, */
/*    the drawback to this is that a high PTC ratio will catch up to a new */
/*    user at their sixth logon. I run a PTC of 0.250 which is equivalent */
/*    to one post to every four logons and the ratio doesn't seem to */
/*    overload my new users although I give the free logons. */

                 ---- Problems And Solutions For WWIVQWK ----

     There  are two common mistakes made when sysops install WWIVMAIL/QWK, the
first being that the sysop forgets to add the DSZ  set  commands  which  might
cause  DSZ  to loose the active comport if the BBS operates on a comport other
than com1. Secondly, WWIVQWK.EXE requires about two  megs  of  disk  space  to
create the compressed message packet for the user. Michael Lieb advises you to
make sure that you have two megs of free space on the same drive as the BBS or
reset the TEMP directory variable with a set command in either your BBS.BAT or
AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
     The  second  alternative  of  resetting  the  TEMP  variable  will  cause
WWIVQWK.EXE  to  create  the  compressed packet on another drive and directory
than the TEMP subdirectory under the main BBS directory. This feature might be
advantageous  to  local  network  servers  who  handle  many  BBS network mail
deliveries.

The set command looks like this;
     set TEMP=e:\temp\

     WWIVQWK.EXE sends the message "aborting packet,insufficient disk  space".
Well  this  message can be caused by two items, either your hard drive is full
therefore limiting QWK's packet forming ability or you  have  a  bad  copy  of
PKZIP.EXE in the path someplace.

     QWK  initiates  the  download  to the user but exits DSZ.EXE with code 1.
Think about it, if you're using a hacked copy of DSZ you need a newer version,
either  this or your user(s) are using a hack of DSZ. If your users report bad
downloads from QWK find out which protocol they  used,  9  out  of  ten  times
you'll  find  that  they are using Procomm+ Ymodem which isn't compatible with
true Ymodem Yam (DSZ.EXE).

     Well other than this what can I say? Once  you've  added  the  utility  I
believe that you'll love it. My users utilize QWK as often as they play Barren
Realms Elite.

FORWARD TO CHAPTER FOUR

     Rather that continue with the old format of this tutorial (that is, where
I'd  sit  down and write for hours at a time making one big chapter) I'm going
to change it a bit. So that I can keep constantly giving you material to  work
with,  I'm  going  to  tackle  SMALLER  topics.  So while the chapters will be
smaller, they will (I promise) be released more frequently. This will make  it
easier  on  both you and me (I won't have to write so long, and you won't have
to trudge through a HUGE tutorial, you can take your time  and  digest  little
bits at a time).



FUNCTIONS!

     Functions  are,  as  Herbert Schildt puts it, "the building blocks of C."
You can think of words much like sentences in our English language. The  words
(program statements) make up sentences (functions) which grouped together form
a paragraph (or story) which is the program itself.

     Most other structured programming languages support the use of functions.
Turbo  Basic  calls  them "subroutines," Modula-2 calls them "procedures," and
Pascal has an actual "function."

     Put simply, a function is  a  piece  of  a  program  that  performs  some
operation  or  group of operations. These operations can work with the rest of
the program (or with other functions) or  totally  independent.  We  will  see
examples of how to use functions shortly.


FUNCTIONS IN C

In C, the general form of a function is

     return_value function_name (argument_list)
     {
          local_variable_declaration;
          statements;
     }

but we can look at only a generalized picture of it:

     name()
     {
          statements;
     }


     So  far, the only function we have used is main(), which must be found in
every C program you write. It is the function that is executed first upon  the
start of your program.

     A  function's  code  begins following the opening brace '{' and ends with
the closing brace '}'. Remember that in C, braces set off LOGICAL BLOCKS.  The
function's  code  is  enclosed  in one logical block. There can be more blocks
inside of each function. If this is confusing to you now,  don't  worry  about
it. We'll dive deeper into this later.

Ok, now that we know what a function is, let's take a look at how one works.

     /* Beginning of F1.C */

     #include <stdio.h>

     function1()
     {
          printf ("everyone");
     }

     main()
     {
          printf ("Hello ");
          function1();
          printf (" out there!");
     }

     /* End of F1.C */


     Let's  take  a  look  at  what  that  program does. The first thing to be
executed is the first printf() statement in the  function  main()  [IMPORTANT:
remember  that  main()  is  ALWAYS  the first function to be executed!]. Next,
function1() is called. So, follow with the program yourself  and  jump  up  to
function1(). The first (and only) statement in function1() is another printf()
statement. Then function1() exits and returns to execute the third  and  final
printf() statement, giving us the output:

     Hello everyone out there!


     See?  Real easy. That's an example of how functions call other functions.
If this seems strange to you, don't worry. Practice  makes  perfect.  Here  is
another example. See if you can trace it.


     /* Begining of F2.C */

     #include <stdio.h>

     p1()
     {
          printf("1");
     }

     p2()
     {
          p1();
          printf("2");
     }

     main()
     {
          p2();
          printf("3");
     }

     /* End of F2.C */


Can you guess what the output of this program is? Its:

     123

     Follow  it  with  me...  first  main() is executed, which calls p2(). The
first statement in p2() is a call to p1(). p1() prints  the  "1"  and  returns
back  to  p2()  which prints the "2" and returns to main(). main() then prints
the "3" and we're done.

     See how easy it is to create functions that  call  other  functions?  Now
lets take a look at making functions return something.


FUNCTIONS AND RETURN VALUES

     In  C,  functions can be used to represent any simple data type. Remember
those? (void, int, char, float, double, etc.) Every function in C can return a
value  to its caller. The way we do this is by specifying the type of data the
function returns.

     Now remember that special data type, void.  Void  simply  means  that  we
don't  care about any value for that function. So far, all of the functions we
have used to date could have been  specified  as  void  functions  because  we
weren't using return values.

Ok, let's take a look at a simple program which returns a value to the caller.


     /* Beginning of F3.C */

     #include <stdio.h>

     int function()
     {
          return(3);
     }

     void main()
     {
          int my_int;

          my_int = function();
          printf ("%i", my_int);
     }

     /* End of F3.C */


     Ok,  this  may be a little more complicated to trace, but let's give it a
shot. First, main() is executed. Inside  main()  [NOTE:  see  how  main()  was
declared as a void function because we don't care what it returns] we have the
local variable my_int which is an integer. The next statement assigns a  value
to  my_int,  but in order to get that value, the computer has to first execute
the function() to get it, and then the printf() statement prints out a "3".

     Let's take a look at function(). See the return() statement. The return()
is  used  in  C  to  have  a  function exit to it's caller. If the function is
declared as non-void, you may return a value  of  the  declared  type  to  the
caller.  If  you  declare  your  function  as non-void and DON'T have a return
value, your compiler will most likely issue you a warning. You can use  return
in a void function, to exit. No value is returned, however.

     Here,  our  function  is  useless. We could just as well substitute the 3
into our printf() statement and save ourselves a lot of trouble. So let's take
a  look  at  a  function that returns a meaningful value, the square root of a
number. It's located in the header file math.h, so  we  have  to  remember  to
#include it.


     /* Beginning of F4.C */

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <math.h>

     void main()
     {
          double answer;

          answer = sqrt(10.0);
          printf ("%f", answer);
     }

     /* End of F4.C */


     See,  by running this program, how sqrt() returns the square root of 10.0
to be placed in the variable answer. (Remember to include the decimal point).


FUNCTION ARGUMENTS

     An argument is sometimes called a parameter in  other  languages.  It  is
basically  data  that  is  sent  TO  a  function  to  be use in the function's
operations. For example, take a look at this function:

     void print_product (int x, int y)
     {
          printf ("&d", x * y);
     }


     This function, called  print_product(),  takes  two  arguments  (each  an
integer)  and  displays  their  product.  We  can  call print_product() from a
program like:

     void main()
     {
          print_product (5, 6);
          print_product (12, 2);
          print_product (2, 4);
     }

     and receive the outputs 30, 24, and 8, respectively. It is worthwhile  to
note  that  if  you  don't  intend on your function taking any arguments, it's
argument list should be  declared  as  void.  For  example,  in  the  previous
example,

we could have declared main() as

     void main (void)
     {
          ...
     }

     This  is  how professionally written C programs are constructed, and this
will be the convention I shall use in the future.

     Ok, so here's an example of a short  program  that  takes  arguments  AND
gives a return value:


     /* Beginning of F5.C */

     #include <stdio.h>

     int sum (int a, int b)
     {
          return (a+b);
     }

     void main (void)
     {
          printf ("1 + 3 is %i \n", sum(1,3));
          printf ("5 + 7 is %i \n", sum(5,7));
          printf ("10 + 28 is %i \n", sum(10,28));
     }

     /* End of F5.C */


This program produces the output:

     1 + 3 is 4
     5 + 7 is 12
     10 + 28 is 38


     You  trace  it.  Enter  it  into  your computer and run it. Make sure you
understand completely how it works. If you don't send Email to me and  let  me
know what you don't understand.

ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     Artificial  Intelligence is a growing field within the computer sciences.
It encompasses many hopes and dreams of what computer technology has to  offer
the  world. It also encompasses many fears of what computers and robotics will
do to the world.

     But what is AI? That is a very difficult question to answer. It  involves
answering  some  other  questions  that we really cannot answer yet. Questions
like:

     1) What is Intelligence?

     2) Can a machine think?

     3) If so, can it think like a human being or will the thinking process
        involved be fundamentally different.

     4) What will it do for, or maybe to, human beings.

     Lots of other questions I could think up as well if I wanted to sit  here
and  think  about  it  for  a  little  while.  Most  of  these  questions  are
unanswerable in any definitive way. First, nobody is  sure  what  intelligence
is.  Does  a machine that looks like it is intelligent really qualify as being
intelligent, or is it just obeying simple commands and doing a good  imitation
of intelligence? See what I mean?

     The  father  of  Computer  Science  and  Artificial Intelligence was Alan
Turing. He  was  a  brilliant  and  innovative  mathematician.  He  helped  in
designing  one  of  the first computers ever to be built. He wrote many papers
that are still used for the ideas he expressed in them. Turing said "A machine
has  artificial  intelligence  when there is no discernible difference between
the conversation generated by the machine and that of an intelligent person."

     This has been used as the practical definition of AI by  many  since  the
time  Turing  first expressed this thought in 1950. Why? Couldn't it just be a
good imitation? Yes, it could be just an imitation of true  intelligence;  but
how  do  you know that the people around you that you consider intelligent are
not just real good imitations? There is probably  no  final  word  on  whether
something or somebody is intelligent or not. So, you've a practical definition
in absence of an absolute.

     The test that is implicit in Turing's definition is  called  the  "Turing
Test"  in his honor. So far, no computer or electronic machine has ever passed
the Turing Test. There have been some very good imitations  so  far,  but  all
have  had  limits on them that make it apparent. After some observation of the
output for some time, it becomes a rather simple task to figure out that it is
a computer. Some take longer than others, but all have failed in the end.

     Mankind  has  always  dreamed of Artificial Intelligence, even before the
term to express the dream had been invented. Greek mythos had  Hephaestus  who
fashioned  human-like  figures  regularly  in  his  forge.  Aphrodite  brought
Galactea - a man-made woman, to life.

     Medieval Christians had the legend of Pope Sylvester II, who was credited
with  building  a  talking  head  that  answered  questions  about the future.
Medieval European Jews had Rabbi Judah ben Loew who created the Golem  out  of
clay.  The Jewish legend ends, however, with the Golem having to be dismantled
because it got out of control. This may be the first instance  of  "Technology
is  bad"  or  "Man  was  not  meant to know certain things" ideas. Author Mary
Shelley  took  large  parts  of  the  Rabbi  ben  Loew  myth  for  her   novel
"Frankenstein," first published in 1818.

     The  20th Century saw the rise of science fiction as a legitimate form of
literature. With it, came Isaac Asimov and his "Three Laws of Robotics".  This
was  a  practical  approach  to robots (Which are just computers that can walk
around, aren't they? C3PO from "Star Wars" and Data from "Star Trek: The  Next
Generation"  are  examples  of  robots as I am thinking of them here. I am not
thinking of those industrial machines that move around a little.)

    The three laws of robotics are:

First Law:  A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction allow
            a human being to come to harm.

Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given to it by a human being except
            where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

Third Law:  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
            does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

(Note: Isaac Asimov always gave credit for the Three Laws to John W. Campbell,
       Jr.  But Campbell always said they were Asimov's. Asimov ended up with
       the copyright so he gets the credit. Besides, the laws were used in
       stories written by Isaac Asimov.

     Asimov's approach to computers and robotics involved built-in  safeguards
to  protect  human  beings  from their own creations accidentally causing them
harm. This is the opposite of the basic moral of Frankenstein or the Rabbi ben
Loew  legend.  Intelligent computers won't be able to harm humans because they
will be sophisticated enough to allow for built-in safeguards. This  does  not
mean  one  couldn't  build them without built-in safeguards, but why would any
person take a chance like that? Only terrorists and madmen would even  attempt
it, in my opinion. Militaries might narrow down the basic definition, but even
they will leave safeguards in for most practical matters. Nobody  wants  their
own machine turning on them when it can be avoided.

     So,  I  am against the Doomsday Sayers as to what Artificial Intelligence
will bring. Computers will not be turning on their masters.  Not  without  the
masters screwing up big time first, anyway.

     Probably  the  two most important names in AI other than Turing are those
of John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky. McCarthy  is  the  inventor  of  the  LISP
programming   language.   Minsky  has  done  much  work  on  organization  and
representation of knowledge.

     LISP is the big-name programming language in the AI  field.  Of  the  100
most   important  artificial  intelligence  research  programs  ever  written,
probably 95 of them were written in LISP.  The  others  were  probably  either
written  before  LISP came around in 1958, or were written in Prolog, a recent
language to come around and still not widely used in the United States.

     LISP stands for LISt Processing. It is  an  interpreted  language,  which
means  each program statement isn't looked at seriously until run-time. To use
LISP you have to think recursively. A recursive function  includes  itself  as
part  of its own definition. A LISP sees no difference between the program and
the data being acted upon.

     Prolog, though, (a recent newcomer to the field of AI relative to  LISP),
has  gained  a small following now. Prolog stands for PROgramming in LOGic. It
uses predicate calculus  techniques  in  attempting  to  prove  the  truth  of
propositions from a set of axioms.

     Neither  LISP  or  Prolog  is  much like the normal programming languages
BBSers would know - like C, Pascal, Basic, Fortran, COBOL, etc.  Neither  LISP
nor Prolog is a structured programming language.

     The  most  famous  program Artificial Intelligence has given the world is
ELIZA. ELIZA was developed by Joseph Weizebaum in the mid-1960's at MIT. ELIZA
simulates a Rogerian therapist; you can conduct a conversation with ELIZA just
as you might with a psychiatrist. ELIZA was  a  first  attempt  to  see  if  a
computer  could  pass the Turing Test. ELIZA used basic trickery in an attempt
to appear human. It would look for key words  in  the  conversation  and  turn
around statements made by you into questions.

     Here  is an example of a conversation of an ELIZA with a person. (CAPS is
ELIZA)

HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

Fine.  Men are all alike.

IN WHAT WAY?

They're always bugging us about something or other.

CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE?

Well, my boyfriend made me come here.

YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE?

He says I'm depressed most of the time.

I'M SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED.

It's true.  I am unhappy.

DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE UNHAPPY?

I need some help, that much seems certain.

WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU IF YOU GOT SOME HELP?

    See how impressive that ELIZA program can be.  It looks almost intelligent
at first glance.  But when you  look at it you  can see it  just latched on to
what the  person interfacing with it  said  and  turned the  input around into
questions  most  of  the  time.  ELIZA  would  also  look  for  keywords  like
"boyfriend," "mother," "father," and "death," etc. etc. If the  program  would
be giving intelligent responses it couldn't really turn input around. It would
understand what the person typing with it meant  when  she  said  it  was  her
boyfriend  who made her talk to ELIZA and wouldn't ask a generic question like
"YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE?"

     ELIZA did not demonstrate real understanding or intelligence.  It  was  a
very  good  first attempt to try and pass the Turing Test and is still studied
today because it is easy to draw up a simple ELIZA program and play  with  it.
When  I was in my second year College LISP class, it was the first programming
project assigned to us. We had to design an ELIZA of  our  own.  Now,  what  I
wrote  was  functionally stupid but it was a fun project and many of the basic
concepts of AI (if not all of them) are part of it.

     The major areas Artificial Intelligence research has divided itself  into
are: Expert Systems, Natural Language Processing, Symbolic Processing, Problem
Solving (Mathematical proof solving), Pattern Recognition,  Robotics,  Machine
Learning, and Appearing Human.

     In  the  second installment of this series, I will try to provide a rough
overview of each of these areas.

³ Isn't It Great Being A Sysop? ³ Louhal (1@10)
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     Let  me start off by saying that I have had a wonderful time being a WWIV
Sysop. Having The Forest BBS up has bought me many hours of pleasure and  have
affected my meeting many people to begin with.

     The  other  day a user invoked the chat call. This user, who we will just
call Author Annoyance, just wanted to chat. I don't mind chatting with Author,
but he does like to ramble.

     "Louhal,  I've  been  meaning  to  ask you," like every other question he
starts out with. He goes on "You must love being a  Sysop,  the  job  must  be
fabulous,  I  wish  I  could do it." Well in thinking I started to frown a bit
because this person must have no life outside of weekly  trips  to  Venus.  He
must not have really thought about that one.

     In  thinking  back,  I  remember  The  Forest's start. First, after being
thrown from about every BBS in Western New York for [file] Leeching, I was fed
up.  I would start up my own board. In choosing the kind of software I thought
it would be easy. HAH! 300 different kinds and no help from any author.  Heck,
even  Wayne  himself  is almost unreachable except those little dominions that
shell him lots of registration fees and worship his greatness <grin>. I  could
have  searched  for  months.  A friend told me to write my own, but that would
have taken years! No, WWIV was the Best out the bunch. Actually,  it  was  the
only one that virtually asked no questions and installed itself.

     Next,   there   came   external   protocols   and   doors.  Those  awful,
mind-degrading doors. I remember raiding all that I could to  find  doors  and
calling  the countryside to download. After counting the change left over from
Ma Bell's long distance hit, I finally had enough to register Tradewars. Those
annoying  UNREGISTERED signs and short frills on customization make you really
go head-long to do that.

     Next, came the modem. The old 300 baud just didn't attract users like  it
should have. Upgrading to 2400 took a little stinch of cash, but I didn't feel
satisfied till I got the 14.4. I mean, those teen boppers  won't  call  unless
they can play those onliners and crash your board in only 30 minutes.

     Then came the name. I was into conservation when I started this thing and
so the name The Forest came to mind. To be honest,  conservation  was  cheaper
and  I  could  have  bought one already with the amount of cash I had put into
this thing. My users probably are laughing now at the name, but  it  was  mine
and who cares if they call. Besides me...

     After  carefully  installing the board - well, messing up a few times - I
came to the conclusion I needed help. A wonderful friend of mine had  a  great
suggestion:  read the docs. Well, let me tell you, after Einstein woke up from
the punch, he will never make  that  suggestion  again.  But  after  carefully
reading  the  docs,  I had installed and set the board up and was almost ready
for business.

     One important aspect about a board is security. In thinking about it, you
can  do  it in two ways. Open it up and turn the trashers and hackers loose or
make yourself a little electronic Fort Knox. In choosing the  loosely  guarded
way,  I  stood  the  chance of having the drive reformatted every 20 mins. The
Fort Knox approach meant one caller every 20 days for lack of being able to do
anything.  I chose the more secure way because the purchase of the modem meant
no tape backup. Oh well, doesn't account for much now since I  have  a  backup
and don't use it.

     Well,  after  all  was set up, I waited for callers. I had the phone line
put in and posted the number on every board  in  existence.  Why  aren't  they
calling? After calling the board from a friend's house, I found out about that
stupid INIT string thing. Well, a week went by and after finally  getting  one
that  worked,  I  got  a caller. BBS Buster from everywhere USA. Well, it took
Buster about 10 mins to post that the board was  dirt  and  I  was  worst.  He
posted  all over not to call The Forest unless you want to step in Forest Doo.
Well, I deleted him and got that little satisfaction. Next, I  meet  this  guy
named  Jim.  He  calls up and says join his net. Well, I ignored him the first
time, but he got me to say yes. Well, this bug-eyed weasel wanted the board up
now!  We  worked  half  of  the  night to get it up. Some kid on the other end
(ICEFREEZER) suggested reading the docs. Twenty minutes later, after he got up
(did  I  mention  there  was a quality about Jim I liked?), we we got the dang
thing to recognize the network. Now I can call myself a sysop.

     Back to Mr. Annoyance. How could what I  went  through  be  so  great?  I
immediately  dropped chat and kicked him off. That reminds me to drop over and
properly low level format his drive.

     When thinking back, always remember, you probably wouldn't do it again!

³ How I Started In BBSing - Part Two ³ Louie (6@1)
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     Hi,  there.  A  few months back IceNEWS ran a story about how some of the
IceNEWS Staff, Random (Wayne Bell) and Filo all got started being involved  in
BBSing.  We  got some nice feedback about the article and therefore set off to
do, just like a "Star Indy Jones Wars of Trek" film; a sequel.

     I went around and asked a bunch of folks if  they  would  be  willing  to
write  short  pieces  about  how  they  got  involved in BBSing. Got four nice
responses from Deanna, #1 @8407, Daryl, #1 @5900, Jim, #1 @1, and Toadress  #2
@3461.

     Deanna  is  the  fun  loving babe of WWIVlink fame. Daryl is from the 509
Area Code, aka: The Area Code from Hell!! Jim was  ordered  to  write  by  the
IceNEWS  staff  or  we  would kill him and replace him with a stooge to do the
IceNEWS Staff bidding.  Something  we  are  still  considering  I  might  add.
Toadress  was  amazed  that we would ask her to write for IceNEWS. Still don't
know why? I was amazed that four people  consented  to  write  for  lowly  ol'
IceNEWS.

    Anyway, I think this is all very, very interesting.  Please read on.

Deanna #1 @8407

     In  1988,  I  was  working for Virginia Power, in the Information Center,
when one of the staff first started  a  company  BBS.  Another  employee  soon
converted  the BBS to WWIV, which was version 4.05 at the time. I had a modem,
and called the BBS often. Then some of the Information Center was  demolished,
and  I  offered to take over sysoping the BBS. The employee who had found WWIV
for us taught me a few basics, and gave me the number  of  a  few  local  WWIV
BBS's  to  call for further help. Within weeks I was hooked on WWIV BBSing. In
those days, I did all my BBS calling from work, whenever  I  could  spare  the
time. I didn't even own a PC of my own.

     I  was laid off from Virginia Power in 1989, but being addicted to BBSing
by that time, I used my unemployment checks to buy a PC and modem, so I  could
support   my   habit.   In  December  1989,  I  met  MTB  (then  Moribund  the
Burgermeister, now Midnight Tree Bandit) at a BBS party. He had  been  a  WWIV
sysop  for  a  few  years  by then, and had just moved back to Richmond from a
self-imposed exile in the country, where his Rappahannock Vaporboard  BBS  had
had  only a few callers. He had a BBS ready for Richmond, but no place to live
at the time. I offered the new Vaporboard a place to live on my PC (MTB had to
find  his  own  apartment....), and it moved there in early January, 1990. The
Sisterhood sub was born that same month, out of my fledgling  friendship  with
Ebony  Eyes,  the  "founder"  of  WWIVLink, and our mutual hopes to bring more
women into WWIV BBSing.

     A few weeks later  (February  1990),  the  WWIVLink  split  from  WWIVnet
occurred,  and  the  Vaporboard  went  to  WWIVLink, and so did MTB and I. The
Sisterhood became the WWIVLink Sisterhood (and it still flourishes today!)  By
April,  MTB  had  named  me  the  #1  at the Vaporboard as I was doing all the
administrative work. Later that year, I was voted AC for 804 WWIVLink, and the
following  year I was elected the Eastern Time Zone ZC for Link. It was during
that year that I "met" Jim, 1@1 IceNET, when he applied to Link  for  a  node.
Since  then  I've done a year's stint as WWIVLink's national Vote Coordinator,
and added nodes in WWIVnet, PIN, FemmeNet and now IceNET,  the  latter  mostly
due  to  Jim's urging and MTB's, er, encouragement...:). I'm very pleased with
what I've seen of IceNET so far, and hope to stay here a long time.

     Now if you want the un-expurgated version, you're going to have to get an
account  on  the  Vaporboard, where you'll be in GREAT company: 1@8407 IceNET,
1@18407 WWIVLink, 1@8408 WWIVnet, 1@8 PIN, 1@8408 FemmeNet - 804-730-3340.

Daryl #1@5900

     In the early 80's my girlfriend and I  purchased  a  Tandy  computer  for
purposes  of dealing with the plethora of writing required in graduate school,
my knowledge of DOS was so limited that at one it was a blessing that I had no
hard  drive and loaded PFS Write from floppy. Years later I ended up acquiring
the same computer as she was about to take off for Columbia and had received a
grant  for  a  laptop. I bought a modem in 1988 and called the only BBS in the
county, a nasty cryptic thing that left me with the impression that there  was
some  mainframe  computer  with  different rooms and doors within it. I called
systems in the local largest city, however my first $500 phone bill put an end
to  that,  however  I  was  left  with  the  impression that WWIV was severely
populated with rude children.

     Later I moved into the city again for law school in 1990. I was  ecstatic
as all those toll charges were going to be local calls. I ended up downloading
Maximus and after three days of struggling asked a local WWIV SysOp for a copy
of  WWIV,  needless to say I was up and running in about 15 minutes. I came to
understand that WWIV is not severely populated with rude  children,  but  that
I'd stumbled into several "last for a month" type systems run by children.

     Now,  a  mere  four  years  later I have a small 3 station LAN running, a
consulting company which specializes in automating law firms, and a multi-line
BBS and a grant pending with the federal government to create a national legal
research database for Indian Law Research. The BBS learning  curve  is  indeed
short isn't it?

  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Jim #1 @1

     At  first  I thought BBS's were a pain actually. I'd called a few PCBOARD
types, and the navigation was quite confusing to me. I'd been  calling  a  few
pay  services  like CI$, and spending a LOT of money doing so...but thought it
was enjoyable and interesting to visit the CB channels  and  chat  with  total
strangers for hours on end.

     My  first machine with a modem was a TRS Model 100, and my first computer
a TRS 80 Model 1. The modem in the model 100 was a superfast 300 baud,  though
I  could also use slower baud rates. I was amazed at the time since the screen
writes to the 40x7 LCD screen were faster than I could type.

     My first real computer experience was on mini-computers in the  60's  and
early  70's  before  there  were  PC's.  Programming  was done via front panel
switches. A bootstrap program was toggled in one line at a time, until you had
about 40 lines of code. Then the computer was smart enough to allow input from
an ASR-33 teletype machine. My first program was one that alphabetized a  list
of  10  characters. The program was saved to paper tape, which was the fastest
means of off line storage then (faster than punch cards).

     I got my first IBM compatible PC in about 1985, with a 2400  baud  modem,
and  by  1989  or  so  had decided that CI$ was just too expensive. Icefreezer
asked me in chat on a pay system if I wanted to start a BBS, I said  YES,  and
that  night  we  installed WWIV. I was awed at the program, and quickly put up
the BBS on my voice line (which I ran 24 hours a day for about 4 months).

     Soon I was interested in trying out the WWIV network software. I'd  never
even  see a WWIVnet bbs at that time, so Icefreezer convinced NorthStar to put
up a bbs, and we networked the two. I'll never forget  the  amazement  I  felt
when  I  sent  email  to myself on NorthStar's system (IceNET @2), then called
there to read my note. I was hooked, IceNET began, the rest is history.

  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Toadress #2 @3461

     No one will believe me, but it's true.  Toadress  was  drug  kicking  and
screaming  to  a  computer  keyboard.  I  did  NOT  want to learn how to use a
computer. It was, and for the most part still is, Hubby's  domain.  I  had  no
use, nor time, for a computer in my life.

     Sometime  in  1987,  our dear friend came over and between him and hubby,
the two of them dragged me downstairs to the computer. "You have to TRY this".
So  I  was indoctrinated into the world of a bulletin board. The first board I
was on was called simply "Link" It was a computer in our local PBS station.  I
think  it  had  something like 4 phone lines running into it. Poor John Holste
(the sysop and a Vice President at Channel 9) had to put up with  me  bumbling
around his board.

     And  BUMBLE I did. I was such a novice at it that I had to call Toad (aka
Tom) at work to figure out how to turn off the computer! I would  get  totally
lost  on  the  board. Luckily, the system was in the sysop's office, so he had
chat on most of the time. I would ring desperately to get directions on how to
go from one place to another. He had his hands full.

     But within a month, I was hooked. I had three children at home, all under
the age of 10. The computer allowed me to talk to ADULTS! And not only TALK to
them,  I  got  to explore new ideas and places. The board was populated by not
only myself, but college professors  who  tried  ever  so  gently  to  stretch
everyone's  minds.  We  had  some  wonderful  conversations.  As I said, I was
hooked.

     As time went on, the board evolved.  The  person  who  was  writing  this
particular  software  (sorry  techies,  I  don't  know  what  type it was) was
refining it. We were a beta test site. With each upgrade, here was this  woman
screaming  at  John...  BUT THIS won't work.. Why can't I do THAT anymore? And
believe it or not, John found out that *I* somehow was finding the bugs within
the  software  with  my bumbling. We decided it was because I was NOT a techie
type that I was finding where the weak  points  of  the  software  were.  They
actually  appreciated my input. I seemed to ask the questions that would point
out some deficiency that they wanted to fix (to save their software!!! -g-).

     For a year I enjoyed the Channel 9 LINK and all who inhabited that little
spot of cyberspace. Then due to funding difficulties (what PBS station doesn't
have that?) we were told our unique little club would have  to  close.  I  was
DESPERATE. How to keep my new found friends???

     Well, John suggested that I try a WWIV board. He gave me a few numbers to
try and after much coaxing (I don't take change too well) I did go  ahead  and
call  a  WWIV  board.  The board was called "The Dark Side of the Moon" run by
Matt and Celeste Henry. POOR CELESTE!!! I think  I  must  have  sent  her  the
LONGEST  Validation  letter  on  record!! I had my whole life history in it. I
really wanted to be validated, and unlike the LINK,  this  was  a  non  paying
board.  At Channel 9 as long as you were a PBS supporter, you could LINK. Here
I was on my own. Luckily, Celeste took pity on me, and we  started  the  WHOLE
learning process over again!

     I  got most of the LINK folks to join Celeste's board. Once again, we had
a nice happy family atmosphere. I was such a talker (ain't'  I?)  that  I  was
invited  to  join  other  boards. One was Boardwalk, where Ebony Eyes was, and
another was Radical's Retreat. All the time learning that there were  multiple
viewpoints  on  a  LOT  of  things  that  I  had  thought  there  was only ONE
viewpoint..mine... BOY did I learn *I* was wrong!! I think that  is  what  has
kept  me  BBSing  all this time. The people. I will honestly say that a day on
the BBS doesn't go by with out me learning some new fact.

     Toad Hall came about when sysops around St.  Louis  needed  someplace  to
play  Tradewars  without being called a cheat. Toad was completely absorbed by
Tradewars at the time, so he set up  the  board  strictly  for  the  game.  We
invited  all  the  sysops  we knew to come and play the game. It was a private
board for almost a year.

     But, as all things do, we've evolved.  We  went  with  WWIVnet  at  first
because  it  had  two things. One was a flat $5.00 monthly fee for a dedicated
server, and, two, because it had the Gary and Mary Ann Martin-hosted Tradewars
sub (I told you he was addicted)!

     When  the  Mod  became  available  to have two boards on ONE computer, we
thought we'd died and gone to heaven. Ozz set us up as an  end  node  off  his
board  and  we  were  LINK'ed  once again. Then WWIV changed and we could have
MULTIPLE nodes..and we became an IceNET node. (cause Ice is NICE)

     I have gone from a VERY reluctant computer user to someone who  BBS's  in
total  decadence (on a laptop in the recliner). My daughter is now starting to
BBS, and the boys want to know when THEY can BBS. I  keep  telling  them  they
have  to  learn how to read first! But I can see that the whole family will be
participating in Cyberspace soon enough..then I'll have to go  somewhere  else
for some peace and quiet! (grin) Perhaps I'll take up Embroidery again....

  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     Those  were  all  very interesting. We found out that: 1.) Deanna started
bbsing before she found a  computer  of  her  own.  2.)  Daryl  inherited  his
computer  from  a  girlfriend.  3.)  At one time, Jim hated BBSing (but, then,
PCBoard can do that to a person). And lastly, but not least, 4.) Toadress  was
dragged kicking and screaming into this wonderful culture of ours.

     Sometimes  I  wonder  if  BBSing  Culture really is inspired by sicko LSD
trips... but then, lets all enjoy the ride while it lasts.

     "In the not-so-distant future, a Top-Secret  government  experiment  goes
awry.  A  computer-geek  with  the  intelligence of a doorknob is accidentally
transformed mentally and physically by a  combination  of  science,  medicine,
technology,  and  dumb  luck. The result: the world's first LIVING COMPUTER...
ModemMan! Disguised as Joe Modem, a mild-mannered sysop of a small  electronic
bulletin  board  service  in  a  large  metropolitan  city,  ModemMan fights a
neverending battle with the sinister forces of  evil  to  protect  the  world,
bringing truth, justice, and a higher transfer rate to all..."

                            "Insufficient Memory"

                         Chapter 4: "DEL BOOLEAN*.*"

     In  our  last  chapter,  our hero ModemMan had his Tool Kit taken by V.T.
Killer, thus stripping him of his ModemMan abilities.  As  Joe  Modem,  he  is
forcibly  taken  -  along with Pronto, his sidekick and co-sysop - to a secret
laboratory. There, Joe renews his acquaintance with the evil Dr. Boolean,  his
former  employer  and  creator  of the Penultimate chip - the neural-enhancing
implant that is  the  main  source  of  ModemMan's  power.  Through  Boolean's
recollection of the incident which accidentally turned Joe Modem into ModemMan
instead of Boolean, he makes clear his intention  to  regain  the  Penultimate
chip from Joe's brain, but not until he's had some fun first. For instance, by
strapping our hero into a machine that pumps  line  noise  directly  into  his
cerebral cortex, for starters...

     ç3Ï"íµçşÌé3şfèÖñ&iòûßE¯áî[EtòÜÍÉyééóïê§ÖÂ*åIUïPÙ(æ»hSpãZV8ù

     Joe  Modem  could  barely  make  out  the  image  of Dr. Boolean laughing
hysterically. The line noise Boolean was jacking into him was too much.

     "OK, Ray," said Boolean. "You can turn it off now."

     Joe breathed  a  sigh  of  relief  when  he  heard  that. The line  noise
immediately  ceased  and  the  clasps  around  ModemMan's  hands and feet were
released. Joe got up slowly and stood rather shakily, still disoriented.

     "Well, ModemMan," said Boolean, "I trust you're feeling a bit better now,
eh?"  Joe  nodded  weakly.  "I'm  glad  to  hear  it,"  continued the demented
scientist as he led Joe to another technological contraption of his. "Now, let
me introduce you to another of my favorite inventions I call 'It.'"

     'It,'  as  it was called, seemed to be another chair-like apparatus, this
time with a head restraint and many more wires coming out of It.  All  of  the
wires appeared to feed into a DIN-style plug and a serial interface.

     "OK,  but  what's  it called?" asked ModemMan, apparently still not fully
recovered from the recent barrage of binary bilge given to him by Boolean.

     "Imbecile," sneered Boolean. "The machine is  called  `It,'  you  moron!"
Boolean  shook his head in disgust. "I see my chip didn't add anything to your
IQ level." Boolean led Joe to the front of It. "In fact, I'm going to  conduct
an experiment on that right now. Why don't you have a seat, ModemMan," smirked
Boolean as V.T. and Blue Ray stepped up behind him. "It's the best seat in the
house. Hahaha."

     Joe  warily  sat  down and leaned back. This time, however, there were no
clasps to hold his feet and hands. As Joe regained his senses, he noticed that
Pronto  was  seated  in  an adjacent chair just like his. The major difference
seemed to be that the headgear had been modified to  allow  for  the  lack  of
built-in  interfaces  that  ModemMan  had.  The two were connected by a thick,
black cable. Blue Ray positioned himself by the control panel of the  machine.
Dr. Boolean then proceeded to insert some of the wires into ModemMan's special
surgically-implanted DIN socket and serial port.

     Boolean smiled and said, "Don't worry, ModemMan. This won't hurt any more
than I want it to." He then signaled to Ray to start up the machine.

     The  room went black as the machine started up and Joe soon found himself
in a deep Virtual Reality trance. Joe could hear  Boolean  saying,  "You  see,
ModemMan,  this machine will simply put you in a VR state and you'll just have
to pass through my little, uhh... VR maze that I put together for you.  Enjoy!
Hahahha!"

     As  Blue  Ray  flipped the main switch, ModemMan entered the VR world. He
appeared to be in a darkened corridor with a single light source  illuminating
something  ahead  of  him. As he moved closer. MM could see a huge door with a
sign on it that read 'It' in big letters. He slowly advanced towards the  door
and  it  opened  inward.  As he stepped inside, the door quickly closed behind
him.

     A computer monitor materialized in the Virtual air in front  of  ModemMan
came  towards  him. The monitor held the image of Dr. Boolean. The image spoke
to MM.

     "Welcome, ModemMan, to 'It.' Here's where we see if the Penultimate  chip
did indeed manage to boost a person's IQ as it was designed to do. I figure if
it works on a loser like you, it should do wonders  for  someone  who  already
possesses  something  that  passes  for  intelligence.  Someone  like  me, for
instance."

     The image of Boolean continued speaking. "If you want to get out of  here
alive,  you'll  have  to  pass  a few obstacles. Pretty simple ones, mind you,
since one can't expect a masterpiece when working with  flawed  material,  but
very  real  ones nonetheless, with very real consequences for failure. Oh, and
by the way, we'll be watching your progress out here. Have fun!"  The  monitor
then promptly vanished.

     ModemMan  looked  around. He was presented with four directions to choose
from. Gee, he thought, if Pronto  were  here  he  could  help  me  decide.  MM
wondered  why Pronto had been wired into a device similar to the one he was in
now and what Pronto was going  through  there.  Joe  decided  to  do  the  old
'Eeney-Meeney-Miney-Moe' and picked a door.

     The  door swung open outward unexpectedly, hitting MM flat on the face as
he approached. Gotta watch out for them doors, he thought making a mental note
of  it.  Looking around, he saw that it was a dead end room, with the only way
out the same way he came in. As he turned to  leave,  ModemMan  saw  something
materialize in front of him. It was a mouse. Not of the rodent variety, but of
the computer type. And it also seemed to be alive,  as  it  was  wiggling  its
"tail" cord.

     The  mouse suddenly coiled its tail and pounced on ModemMan, landing with
its tail cord draped over MM's shoulder and its body hanging limply  down  his
back.  The  cord then whipped around MM's neck and began coiling itself around
his throat like a python trying to squeeze the  life  out  of  him.  While  MM
struggled  with  the  tail  cord, the body of the mouse transformed, gaining a
mouth, complete with a set of teeth. The mouse body quickly put  them  use  by
sinking them into MM's posterior region.

     ModemMan  let  loose a howl of agony as he quickly hopped out of the room
and tore the tail cord free of his neck. The tail cord then proceeded to  wrap
itself  around  MM's arm as he desperately reached back to free his fanny from
the bite of the mouse body. Grabbing it and freeing  his  arm  from  the  tail
cord,  MM  swung  the  mouse  around  by  its  tail cord several times to gain
momentum before releasing it. The mouse went flying through the air to shatter
against  one of the doors in front of MM. The impact knocked the door ajar and
it swung open inwardly, revealing Pronto standing in a circle of light. Pronto
then began walking towards MM.

     ModemMan called out to him. "Pronto! There you are! Get over here, I want
to talk to you." Pronto apparently didn't hear ModemMan and  he  walked  right
past him. "Hey, get back here! Where are you going?"

     Joe  ran  after Pronto and pulled him to a halt. His eyes were glazed and
he seemed to be in a trance,as he was chanting "Destroy JM...  Destroy  JM..."
JM,  thought ModemMan, who could that be. As he was pondering over the fateful
question he failed to notice Pronto pulling out a gun and pointing it at  him.
ModemMan  decided  to ask Pronto who this JM person was. He turned around only
to find himself staring down the barrel of an  X-21,Smith  &  Wesson's  latest
creation. He then realized what the JM stood for: Joe Modem.

     "Pronto! What's wrong with you? It's me, your old pal and compadre, Joe!"
Pronto motioned for Joe to back up against the wall. "Hey,Pronto,  you  aren't
going to shoot me, are you? Hey, what're you doing?!! Let me go!!"

     Pronto  had tied Joe to a post that materialized nearby and was adjusting
the sight of his gun. Flipping off the safety, Pronto then lifted the  mammoth
weapon  and levelled it at ModemMan. Somewhere, seemingly from all around him,
the voice of Boolean was laughing loudly.

     "C'mon, Pronto," pleaded ModemMan, "snap  out  of  it.  Don't  shoot  me!
Please!  I'll  give  you  my system password, I'll make you a 255 SL co-sysop,
anything! Just don't shoot me and let the Penultimate get into  the  hands  of
Boolean!"

     MM's  pleas  were futile. Pronto was just about to pull the trigger when,
suddenly, Joe came out of  the  VR  trance.  He  sat  up  and  looked  around,
wondering  just what had happened. Boolean and Blue Ray were standing around a
monitor, also wondering why the machine had stopped working. Ray  flipped  the
switch  up  and down a few times but to no avail. The machine had stopped dead
just in the nick of time. Joe looked at Pronto. He seemed to be  smiling.  How
could anyone smile at a time like this, though Joe. They're probably gonna put
us into something worse now, he thought. That, or just kill us.

     Suddenly,  the  door  burst  open  and  federal  agents  from  the  Modem
Operations  Directorate  armed  with  machine guns rumbled into the room. They
were saved! Two of them quickly cuffed Boolean and Ray and took  them  outside
to  the  squad  car.  A  quick search also turned up V.T Killer and Egg's Head
hiding together in the bathroom, trying to escape out of the window  that  was
in there.

     Pronto  came  over  to Joe, wiping the sweat from his face. "Wow! I can't
believe what just happened. I mean, I was right about to shoot you! Good thing
the  M.O.D.  Squad came in when they did. Otherwise, we might've had some real
big problems."

     Joe thought for a second. "Just _how_ did the feds know where to find us,
anyway, Pronto?"

     "Easy,"  replied  Pronto.  "V.T  and his goon squad were so obsessed with
making sure they searched you, they never bothered  searching  me.  I  had  an
emergency  homing  beacon  in  my belt buckle." Pronto smiled. "I activated it
when they brought us here and untied us and I recognized Boolean."

     One of the agents came over to Pronto and whispered something in his ear.
"Oh  yeah,"  said Pronto, "I almost forgot to ask you... how would you like to
become a member of the Directorate? We've been looking for a good  agent,  and
with  your  Penultimate  powers  there could be endless possibilities. So, how
about it?"

     "Pronto," said Joe, smiling, "I'd be glad to join you the  other  members
in  the struggle to bring truth, justice, and a higher transfer rate for all!"
Joe put his arm around Pronto's shoulder as they walked out  into  the  night.
"Let's go over to Quakey's Bar and celebrate!"

     "Sounds good to me, MM," said Pronto. "One question, though."

     "Shoot," said Joe before he realized the irony of the expression.

     "How do we get there from here? We don't even know just where the hell we
are!"

     The two looked at each other and had a good laugh.
