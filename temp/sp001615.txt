Virtual March on Mexico City

Folks:

It is now extremely easy for all of you with access to the WWW to
participate in the Marcha Virtual in support of the EZLN trip to 
Mexico
City and against the Mexican government's efforts to stop it.

All you have to do is go to the following web page, URL =
http://www.utexas.edu/ftp/student/nave/marcha.html

There you will find an explanation of the protest, and, more 
importantly, 
a hotlink which will allow you to send the same message to all the
intended recipients at once. You click on the hotlink and up pops a 
ready
to send blank message already addressed! Just fill in and click to 
send. 

The page also contain a hotlink to sign-in, letting the organizers 
know
that you have sent the message of support. Moreover, you can also see 
all
the names of everyone (yourself included) who has already 
participated.
Once you sign-in your name appears instantly. Very immediate 
gratification!

So..... get on the stick and punch in the above URL. Providing support 
for
the Zapatistas and sending a message to the State has never been 
easier.

PS: If you don't have access to the WWW you can send the same message 
to
the following addresses. CC's are almost as easy....
