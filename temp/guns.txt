    Safes  come  in  three flavors, burglary, fire and combination burglary
and fire.  They also install two ways, above ground and below ground.	The
below  ground  safes are he** to install and usually have a small capacity,
so I will limit this information the above ground type.

    Burglary resistant safes have an outer wall of  steel  plate  sometimes
hardened to  complicate  drilling  and usually a 1/4 thick or more.  On the
door and frame, hardened  steel  plates  protect  the  lock  and  the  bolt
mechanism.   The  inner  wall is of similar construction to the outer wall.
The frame (the part the bolts and pins go into) will  be  solid  bar  often
hardened.   The  liner (the part between the walls) varies depending on the
manufacturer.  Some use a material similar  to	concrete  with	reinforcing
bars.	Others	use  drill  rods,  ball  bearings,  hardened  plates  or  a
combination of all the above.	The  liner  may  also  contain	wiring	for
connection to  an  alarm.    The  goal	is  to	make  the safe resistant to
drilling and/or  torching.    The  locking  mechanism(s)  will	include   a
relocking device.    That  way ifsomeone tampers with the combination lock,
the relockkicks out and locks up the bolt mechanism.   Burglary  safes	are
rated  by  Underwriters  Laboratories as to being tool or torch or tool and
torch resistant.  This rating reflects how  long  it  takes  one  of  their
professionals to  open a certain size hole in the safe.  Burglary safes are
very heavy for their size and expensive.  Fire	safes  are  constructed  of
sheet metal,  the  frame  may  be  solid  or  sheet  metal.  The liner is a
material similar to plaster,  it  retains  a  certain  amount  of  moisture
that's	released  when	the safe is exposed to fire the idea is to keep the
interior below the burning point of paper.  Fire safes are  rated  by  U.L.
by  the  number  of  hours  they can withstand a fire and keep the interior
below a certain temperature.  Fire safes are lighter  and  cost  less  than
the burglary resistant	safes.	 Which to use.	If the weight and the price
of a burglary resistant safe  is  not  a  problem,they	are  the  best	for
storing guns or  anything else of value.  It's your decision.  I use a fire
safe and consider it enough for storing my guns.   Apartment  dwellers	and
others	who don't live on the ground floor may find a fire safe is the only
option they have.  A burglary resistantsafe large enough  to  hold  rifles,
may exceed  the  weight  capacity  of their flooring.  Keep in mind if your
safe was to drop in on	your  neighbors  uninvited,  it  may  cause  themto
become upset.	As for gun safes, some of the ones I have seen at gun shows
are nothing more fire safes.  I'm not saying  there's  no  good  ones,	but
quite  often  a  person  can  go out and pick up a good used safe for a lot
less money.  What to look for.	Weight, the heavier the safe the harder  it
is to  steal.  If it has wheels remove, them when you get it where you need
it.  If the safe is light enough to be carried by two people or  less  bolt
it  down  or build it in, preferably with tamper resistant hardware, If you
build it in make sure it can not be rocked or moved  around  otherwise	you
may find  it  used  as a battering ram.  If you bolt your safe to the floor
or a wall don't allow enough clearance that someone can get a  pry  bar  in
and pull  out  the  anchors  or  the entire safe.  Be sure to use the right
anchors for the  material  you	plan  on  mounting  it	to.    The  locking
mechanism.   It  should  have  at  least  two bolts opposite the hinge that
extend a minium of two inches into the frame.	The  bolts  should  not  be
centered on  the  locking  mechanism.	 For example if the lock is halfway
from top to bottom on the door.  The bolts should  be  one  third  and	two
thirds	down  from the top this helps to prevent drilling and punching back
the lock.  There should be bolts or pins on the hinge side,  this  protects
the safe  if someone cuts or punches the hinges.  There also should be pins
that extend from the door into the frame of the safe towards  the  rear  of
the  safe, this helps to prevent someone from spreading the frame away from
the door and releasing the bolts.    The  bolts  and  the  lock  should  be
protected by  hardened	inserts.The  safe  should  have a U.L.	listed lock
with a relocking device.  The safe it self should be U.L.    listed  as  to
it's type  and rating.	If your storing guns in a safe and find moisture to
be a problem I suggest using more oil or some other rust preventative.	  I
have  seen  fire  safes  where people have installed heating rods to reduce
moisture inside the safe.  Two problems, one the rods  dry  out  the  liner
reducing  the  fire  rating and two a hole must be drilled to feed the wire
through.  Unless the hole is filled  with  an  approved  firestop  compound
surrounding  the  wire, the fire rating will be reduced or lost completely.
Finally remember no safe can keep someone out, it can only  slowthem  down.
If  you  have  an  alarm system, be sure to have your safe connected to it.
Make sure the installer uses a contact	that  is  U.L.	  listed  for  safe
protection,   all  too	often  installers  use	regular  surface  contacts,
installed on the outside thy are easily compromised.   To  install  one  on
the  inside  requires  drilling  the safe, with all the problems associated
with installing heat rods.  If you don't have an alarm consider  installing
a  basic  one,	starting with the safe and later expanding it to the entire
premiss and connecting it to a monitoring center.
