Starting

Press K or J for Keyboard or Joystick.
Select level (0-5).  The default level
is 0.  Press return.  If K was pressed,
keyboard controls can now be selected.
When "VERIFY:" appears, press Y unless
a mistake was made.  Then the game will
load.  If J was pressed, the game will
be loaded immediately.


Game

Shoot everything that tries to shoot
the plane, which is being controlled
by the input device previously
selected.  That's about it.  Flak has
only one terrain.  The levels are of
difficulty, level 0 being the least
difficult.


Notes

The Flak loader uses Applesoft
routines, and therefore, if you don't
have Applesoft in rom or ramcard, you
probably won't be able to run Flak.
This has been forseen as a problem
which will arise for very very few
people.  If you are one of these, then
please get a new computer and get
yourself out of the dark ages.
Integer basic is dead!

The optional Flak loader (FLAK.SHORT)
may be used instead of the usual one
if you are limited in transfer time or
disk space.  It replaces the files
FLAK and FLAK.LOAD.  In any case,
the main file, FLAK.CODE, is required.
