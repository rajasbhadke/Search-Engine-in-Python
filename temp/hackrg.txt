STOP READING THIS TEXT NOW. @8@8@8 hehe

This is to alert all who care about a serious flaw in RENEGADE. This can do
serious harm , or at least be a real pain in the ass to recover from. Let me explain.
   As you may have suspected, the MCI codes could be quite dangerous. The MCI
code for a 2 second pause in renegade, as you probably know, is "@8". what do you think would happen if a bunch of 2 second
pauses were strung together???? i'll tell ya, you and your users would think
the board locked up. Imagine a message in every base 80 columns wide and the
maximun message length of 200 lines long.......a pause 16,000 seconds long...
4.4 hours!!!! well we both know that nobody is gonna stay around 4.44 hours
to see the end of the message, so they drop carrier. then they call back and
try to read the message again, and the same thing happens. So, you , the ever
vigilant Sysop figures you'll delete the offending message, but guess what??
the only way to delete a message is to view it first, isnt that special????
a total screwover.

   Well, there are precautions you can take. the first one is to raise the
MCI acs on all message bases. I used to allow the use of MCI codes in the war
base, but since my evil mind figured this one out, they are there no longer.

  As far as a way to overcome this problem if it has already occured, i cant
figure it out, but if anyone else has a solution, lemme know. the ultimate
screwover would be for somebody to upload a .qwk packet containing a whole shitload of these @8 messages in every base.
i think it would be re-configure time, no?
