|        I've added a column to indicate whether a board is PC Pursuitable    |
|   or not, and which outdial to call through if it is. The nodes which are   |
|   marked with an * require a "1" dialed before the number.  This feature    |
|   is mainly for those who call BBS's and read bulletins at a lower speed,   |
|   but call back to download or upload at 9600.  As you may be aware, PC     |
|   Pursuit is in the process of updating their exchange lists.  Some of      |
|   BBS's that were previously PC pursuitable are no longer accessible thru   |
|   the service.  Please let me know if there are any corrections in regard   |
|   to the PCP accessibility by leaving me e-mail on the Lexicon Exchange.    |

|        US Robotics has announced two new 9600 baud modems, to be shipped    |
|   in January.  One is a V.32 modem, and NOT compatible with our current     |
|   HSTs.  The other is a Dual Standard V.32 and IS HST compatible.  There    |
|   is NO sysop upgrade for these modems.  I spoke with Susan at USR and she  |
|   told me that the company upgrade plan for owners of the current HSTs is   |
|   $799 PLUS your old modem.  She seemed convinced that we could easily      |
|   sell the modems we have now for $500... and reorder the new Dual          |
|   Standard modem for $725 (an additional cost of $225).  Personally, I      |
|   find this policy somewhat unacceptable.  Of course, there is really no    |
|   need to rush out and buy a Dual Standard modem at the present time,       |
|   except to keep up with current technology.  Since our existing modems     |
|   are compatible with it, any sysop purchasing a new USR will only be       |
|   interested in the Dual Standard modem.                                    |
|                                                                             |

|        I would like to thank all of those sysops who have displayed this    |
|   list in their BBS systems, and who have made it the most widely-used      |
|   Apple BBS list in use these days.  Other sysops are encouraged to         |
|   incorporate the List into their systems as well, so long as the contents  |
|   remain unaltered.                                                         |
