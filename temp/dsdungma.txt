incredibly close to finishing dungeon master.  I just sent nick the final
patches and he's testing them out.  i still haven't decided on an appropriate
page though.  should I have this likttle guy animated pissing on a
jon-look-a-like (for those of you who don't know.  jon weighs about 300 pounds
and is incredibly annoying...saw him at applefest.)  or do I have something
crushng a kLuBB 96 emblem...or do I just forget it.  i doubt I'll just let it
slide...but I don't know.  this is the second offense against us from that
group and I'm getting pissed.

later


I believe that Club 96 has hit a nerve.  hehehe....


Kl   (Nice speach ralph....(tarnished...hehe))
