             NGO - FORUM 1995 SOCIAL SUMMIT

Here is  some  preliminary information on NGO Forum '95 Social
Summit.  It should,  however, be stressed that it is temporary
and that an international newsletter will be ready soon.
The Host Committee for NGO Forum '95 is looking forward to the
coming year's  preparations  for  the  Social  Summit  and  to
welcoming  thousands of NGO (non-government organizations) and
PO  (popular  organizations)  representatives  in  Copenhagen,
March 1995.
The Host  Committee has been elected by representatives of 100
Danish  NGOs  and  POs.  The  Committee  has   established   a
Secretariat, headed by Secretary-General Jan Birket Smith.
The Secretariat  is  funded  by  the Danish Government,  which
bears the running expenses of  the  Secretariat,  newsletters,
other  preparatory  activities as well as of the NGO Forum '95
itself.  The fund does,  however,  not cover  NGOs'  and  POs'
travelling expenses and stay in Copenhagen.
NGO Forum  '95  will  be  the  culmination  of  many months of
worldwide preparation, the culmination will, however, not be a
full  stop.  The work will continue after March 1995 with more
ideas and more action as a result of  the  many  international
contacts established up to and during the Social Summit.
We will  provide you with information on the tasks of the Host
Committee and the progress of the preparations for  NGO  Forum
'95  in  Copenhagen.  You  will also receive information about
which facilities you can expect to find in Copenhagen. But now
a  few  words  about  the  reason for NGO activities up to and
during the Social Summit.
The issue of social development cannot only  be  left  in  the
hands of politicians and government officials.  It is a public
matter  in  which  everybody  has  to  take  an  active  part.
Initiatives  from NGOs and POs are decisive in order to ensure
a more equal distribution of wealth as  well  as  in  ensuring
social justice both internationally and nationally.
Civil society  in  each  country  is  able  to influence their
government and can insist that the promises of the  government
are  not  just  scattered  to the winds but actually result in
action and changes.  At global  level  civil  society  has  an
enormous potential. Together we can hold the UN and individual
countries to their promises and resolutions.
Without the participation of  a  dynamic  civil  society,  the
critics  of  the  Social  Summit might be right:  thousands of
beautiful words,  promises and fine signatures on declarations
and  plans  of  action  are  not  sufficient  to  alleviate  a
distorted world and social injustice.
During the first part of the preparatory process of the Social
Summit,  it  has been our impression that the UN is respecting
the NGO community as a necesarry and important partner. We are
looking forward to positive and constructive co)operation with
the UN until the second PrepCom and in the future.
Participants from all over the world
At present we are facing two major  problems,  which  must  be
solved  in  order  to  ensure  that  NGO  Forum  '95 will be a
success:  The participation of NGOs at PrepCom I in  New  York
was characterized by a heavy predominance of participants from
the North that is,  participants from  the  USA,  Canada,  and
Europe. Only a small number of NGOs and POs from the South and
even fewer from the SNG countries were present.
It is  therefore  of  desicive  importance  to   ensure   that
potential  donors  donate  money in order to guarantee a broad
participation of organizations from these parts of  the  world
in  NGO  Forum  '95.  A  large number of NGOs and POs from the
developing   countries   is   financially   restricted    from
participating  in  the  international  preparations  and  from
paying for the travel and stay in  Copenhagen.  NGOs  and  POs
from   the   SNG  countries  are  facing  the  same  financial
constraints.  If we are  not  capable  of  ensuring  financial
support  from  donors and thereby facilitate the participation
of NGOs from these  ressource  weak  organizations  in  future
work, the NGO Forum '95 will not be a success.
Cooperation with the UN
The UN  has  a structure and an organization,  which have been
firmly cemented through almost 50  years  of  activities.  The
UN's  form  of organization and decision)making procedures etc
are very different from those of NGOs  and  POs.  It  is  very
important  for  the success of NGO Forum '95 to clarify how we
should work together with the official Summit.
During the PrepCom I a Facilitating  Committee  with  a  loose
mandate was established by the NGOs and POs. The tasks and the
mandate of the Committee will be discussed more closely at the
second PrepCom in August 1994.
It is not the task of the Host Committee to decide on or be an
advocate for whether NGO Forum '95 is to have  a  Facilitating
Committee  or not.  The reason why the question is brought up,
is that it is important to find a solution to the co)operation
between the NGO community and the UN.
The tasks of the Host Committee
It should  be stressed that the Host Committee does not have a
political mandate neither nationally nor internationally.
The Host Committee's assigned tasks are:
"information/communication" "coordination" "facilitation"
Information
NGO Forum  '95  will keep you up to date on preparations going
on in Copenhagen.  You will receive  the  information  through
international  networks  (among others the one you are reading
right now) and through our own newsletter.
The Host Committee  is  also  responsible  for  informing  the
Danish  public  about NGO Forum '95.  It is essential that NGO
Forum '95 does not become an isolated  island  in  the  Danish
reality.  Social  development  also  concerns the Danes and by
making use of the Danish press and involving Danish  NGOs  and
POs,  we  will  try  to  make  sure that the public discussion
becomes as comprehensive as possible.
Coordination
It is  not  within  the  mandate  of  the  Host  Committee  to
coordinate political point of views,  it is, however, our duty
to effect contacts between NGOs and POs,  if they apply to our
office for services.  We will also be of assistance in passing
on ideas and plans.
The Host  Committee  will  also   coordinate   the   practical
preparation  and  realization of NGO Forum '95 with the Danish
Government and the UN.
Facilitation
The Host Committe is still negotiating with  the  municipality
of Copenhagen about the physical settings of NGO Forum '95.
The site  in  negotiation is a very large market place,  which
compromises a large hall and lots of adjoining buildings.  The
market  place is located less than 1 kilometer from the center
of Copenhagen and approximately 4 kilometers from the official
Summit,   which  is  held  in  the  conference  centre  "Bella
Centret".  A shuttle service  will  be  established,  ensuring
quick and regular transportation between NGO Forum '95 and the
official  Summit.  The  Forum   will,   furthermore,   provide
facilities for handicapped people.
The market place is very suitable for the housing of large and
diversified activities.  For instance by offering the facility
of  accommodating up to 5000 people in one hall,  furthermore,
there  will  be  rooms   for   workshops,   exhibitions,   and
performances.
We urge  all  the  participants  of  NGO Forum '95 to think of
alternative modes of expression.  The official Summit will  be
characterized  by  heaps  of  paper,  long meetings,  and long
speeches.  The spoken and  written  word  is  the  distinctive
feature of an official conference.  NGO Forum '95 should first
and  foremost  be  otherwise  colourful   and   an   exuberant
experience  for  all  senses.  The issue of social development
should  find  its  expression   in   dance,   song,   theatre,
processions,  happenings, concerts, exhibitions ..... you name
it, without loosing its political content.
NGO Forum '95 will be open free of charge  for  all  NGOs  and
POs, who want to participate and who have registered.
The participants of NGO Forum '95 will have free access to NGO
Forum '95's facilities.
The citizens of Denmark and other countries can visit the  NGO
Forum '95 free of charge. All the arrangements will be open to
everybody.
Accommodations
The Host Committee will arrange  accommodation  in  hotels  at
various price ranges, and possibly in youth hostels as well as
in private homes in order to make accommodation affordable  to
everybody.
We are  planning  to send out the provisional application form
by July,  which should provide us with a general view  of  how
many  participants  and what kind of activities we can expect.
At present we calculate on the participation of 2 - 3000  NGOs
and POs, and that about 10.000 people a day will visit the NGO
- Forum '95.  The deadline for the final registration will  be
in the end of November 1994. Organizations can register later,
but after the deadline we cannot guarantee that we can fulfill
requests for specific facilities and accommodation.
In order  to provide for the best planning,  we kindly ask you
to contact the Secretariat as soon as you know what facilities
you  will  need  in  Copenhagen  and  the  possible  number of
participants from your organization.
