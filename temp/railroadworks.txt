
THE RAILROAD WORKS (Simulation for 1 or 2 players)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, KB or joystick input


     Just when model railroaders began to believe layouts couldn't get any smaller, along comes CBS's "The Railroad Works". Now you can construct an elaborate two-train system on your Apple, operate it like any model railroad, or play a game!

     Actually, the program allows building (and saving) any number of layouts complete with tracks, scenery, shipping and receiving sites, and passenger depots. Rolling stock, which may be from the steam era or contemporary, includes two engines, boxcars, tenders, passenger cars, and cabooses. Simple paste/erase construction and twelve hires screens (4x3) of real estate make it a snap to realize even the most ambitious designs.

     Whether the layout is your own or one of several included on-disk, everything works like the real thing. The "Game" option is simply an extension of normal operation which awards a rank ("coal chipper" through "engineer") based upon cargo handling efficiency.

     With two trains running at full throttle on a complex layout, the simulation can be quite demanding; but the real challenge is to your creativity. Endlessly entertaining, you won't find a better value than "The Railroad Works".
