     IceNEWS  is back ! I hope you enjoy this issue as I believe it's just the
first  of  what will be a very  good electronic journal publication. There's a
newfound enthusiasm within the people now helping prepare IceNEWS. I'd like to
give  them  a  hearty  thanks  and  congratulations  for  getting  this  issue
published.  I  feel  the new team will  continue  to grow and develop and will
become  a  yet another gem in the  string of IceNET Innovations you've come to
expect.

     With  great  pleasure,  and as Editor-in-Chief  (who  does nothing :)), I
bring you the new and improved IceNEWS. Read, and enjoy!

     As  this  month's  Managing Editor of  the  newly restructured IceNEWS, I
would  like  to  announce  the  arrival  of  a  new  monthly  feature  to  the
publication,  one  that has been long  overdue. IceNEWS Letters To The Editors
will  now appear in each new issue of IceNEWS as a service from the editors to
the readers.

     As  the network that it serves has  grown, so, too, has IceNEWS. Gone are
the days when only one or two people were responsible for producing IceNEWS as
editors.  This  new  restructuring effort has  added  many  more dedicated and
energetic  people  into  editing and  writing  capacities for IceNEWS, thereby
(hopefully)  broadening  the  scope of  the  publication while maintaining the
highest  overall quality in every respect.  With the addition of new features,
the opportunity for input from our readers also broadens as there will be more
for you to comment on.

     When  the new editors of IceNEWS and others  who also wished to be a part
of  the publication got together and  began the rebuilding of the publication,
one  of the first questions we asked ourselves was "How can we open up IceNEWS
more  to  the readers, the people we're  supposed to be publishing this for in
the  first  place?" One of the first  suggestions  was one of the most simple,
basic  ideas  one can think of, yet so  simple  that somehow it had never been
implemented  before  in  the history of  the  publication. One that appears in
almost every other type of publication, from the largest newspaper or magazine
to the smallest school newsletter. A Letters To The Editors section.

     At  IceNEWS, we want to know what you think about what we publish. As the
editors,  it is our job to put forward  the best possible product to serve the
network  and  the  people who read it. We  need  to know from you if you think
we're doing or not doing our jobs. Did you enjoy the issue? What did you like?
What  did you dislike? Why? What would you like to see more of? Less of? These
are  things we need to know from you, the  readers, to keep us on our toes and
to help us produce the types of issues you'd like to read.

                Please address your responses or questions to:

                           Editor-In-Chief, IceNEWS

     As  this is the first installment of this new continuing feature, we have
no  actual  letters from readers to print  here for this issue. However, we're
counting  on  you  to  change that for us.  Please  take  the time to write us
regarding your feelings on IceNEWS, good or bad. We want to hear what you have
to say. We need to hear what you have to say.

³ Is IceNET in danger of being absorbed by FIDOnet ³ Jessica Lovecraft 1@5462
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     With  the  upcoming release of WWIV4.23  many a SysOp have voiced concern
that  IceNET in it's current state may  be assimilated inside FIDOnet. I think
it's an unwarranted fear mostly found in people who are wary of change.

     I've  been  involved with IceNET for a  while  now. I've seen the network
grow,  change  and adapt. In it's present  format  it has become quite viable.
Perhaps  it's  not  as  well  spread  outside  North  America  as  FIDOnet, or
Internet/Usenet,  however  IceNET  continues  to  grow  and  expand.  With the
multi-language  addition it will most certainly attract new systems from other
areas world wide.

     What  has made WWIV software popular among  those who use it is it's user
friendly  interface. With a minimum of  computer literacy, most have been able
to  run  a netted WWIV BBS. Such is  not  the case with FIDOnet compatible BBS
software.

     In  the past year we have seen features such as multi-network capability.
This has brought to life numerous WWIV based networks, some which are bound to
expand,  but  most  are nothing more  then  local networks who's well-being is
entirely  dependent on one individual the N.C. Most of these smaller nets come
and go without affecting IceNET.

     As  AC in WWIVnet and IceNET for the 514 area, I've noticed recently that
most  of  the  BBSes that have had  longevity  with  WWIVnet also carry either
WWIVlink , IceNET as well as local networks.

     We've  had  FIDOnet in the 514 area code  for  as long as I can remember.
Twice  a local system had decided to gate subs between FIDO and WWIV. Twice it
was  dropped  due to the lack of interest  from  the majority of the sysops in
both networks.

     Making  WWIV  software  compatible  with  FIDOnet  will  permit those who
already  gate  subs or run a dual system  to  continue to do so. Those who are
like  myself  who like things quick and  dirty and had been thinking FIDO will
take the leap, but for most it will be nothing more then an extra feature they
have the option to use.

     The  philosophy  behind both networks is  totally different from both the
standpoint  of  the  sysop and also that of  the  users.  We can all enjoy the
anonymity  that WWIV provides us. This is extremely important to those who are
part  of visible and not so visible minorities.  As a female pagan, I have the
opportunity  to  discuss  with  others  all  over  without  the  fear of being
persecuted for my beliefs in my daily life.

     FIDOnet  does  not  have the same  standards.  For  instance it is common
practice to send files via the network, through automatic request. IceNET is a
more  cost conscious network, where Sysops  are concerned about the extra cost
of having routing information imbedded in the messages.

     Even  the  structure of both networks  is  different. My understanding is
that it is easier to weed out bad apples in IceNET, and keep some control over
the systems that are in the network. Have you tried moderating a heavy traffic
FIDOnet conference?

     Assimilated  inside FIDOnet? In some people's dreams only. Those who have
made  the  network  what it is today will  not  go  FIDO tomorrow. If they had
wished to do so, they would have left long ago.

³ How To Avoid Burnout ³ Chris 1@9680
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     One  of the most fulfilling hobbies I have ever been involved in has been
BBS  communications. And, the most gratifying  part of modem communication has
been  using  bulletin board systems to express  my thoughts and ideas. One can
almost  completely  express themselves through  this wonderful avenue. But, if
you are like me, there comes a time when you put so much into the medium, as a
sysop,  that you loose yourself and other  means of enjoyment from what I call
BBS BURNOUT! This is what I am going to address in this article.

     To define burnout I would be best to describe it in practical terms. Have
you  ever put yourself into something so much and dedicated yourself so wholly
to  something that it seemed to get old? Have you ever seemed to grow tired by
the  very thought of the same thing over and over? Have you ever spent so much
time  on  something that it caused a stress  point to the effect that you felt
like  just tossing in the towel? How about  this? Have you ever felt that your
bbs  takes  too much of your time? That  it  seems to be so addicting that you
just  can't  leave it alone? Your bbs  seems  to cause undo stress because of,
perhaps,  users  that just don't understand how  you put your all into the bbs
but  yet they want you, and even demand you to give them instant action? These
are just some of the symptoms of BBS BURNOUT!

     Now  how  does one handle this situation.  Well, that is the point of the
whole  matter  isn't  it. I personally got  so  burned  out that I announced a
premature closing of my bbs. I was so tired of it all that I was about to shut
it  down  for good. But being as addicted  as the rest of us sysops, I decided
that  was not the thing to do. I needed  to learn how to handle and control my
love for the bbs and, yet, still keep my sanity and my other life's priorities
in line.

     Here  are some things I learned on this  matter that I hope will help you
to never come to the point of burnout, or to help get you through the point of
burnout.  First, look at your priorities. If you don't have any, think of some
of  these.  Which is more important to  you.  How about your family? How about
your  time  to get alone by yourself?  How  about he priority of relationships
outside  the bbs life? What about your means of earning a living? Indeed these
should  be close to the top of your priority list. One needs to set priorities
in their life if they are to survive.

     I  have  a list that I thought you  may  like to see. This is my personal
list that, if only I would adhere to, I would be a lot better off.

1. My family.  Providing for their care  and giving them not only my financial
   benefits but my time, quality time, and providing  advise and love and just
   being there when needed? If this is lacking, it could be most miserable for
   you.

2. My job.  Where do the bucks come from? Sometimes a job can provide a way of
   escape from the same old same old if you know what i mean.

3. My personal time alone.  Now this  really is a  need in everyone's life you
   know.  We  all  need time  to collect  our  thoughts  and to think  the day
   through.  To evaluate our life and see where we have come from and to where
   we are going.

4. My bbs.  This is the last of my priorities. Now sometimes this tends to get
   on  the  top  of  the list,  but when it does,  I find that is when burnout
   becomes a problem.  Yes,  your bbs is an  important  thing,  but is it more
   important than the other priorities?...

     Now  I am not saying that these are  all my priorities, but they are some
of the major ones. How about you? Have you set priorities in your own personal
life? If not, I would suggest that you think your priorities over and set up a
list of importance.

     Second,  after  you have set your  priorities,  consider how you react to
your  bbs. Is it almost an obsessive thing to  you? Can you leave it for a day
without  feeling  that you are missing something.  DO  YOU CONTROL YOUR BBS OR
DOES YOUR BBS CONTROL YOU? That is the root of the thing isn't it? We all need
to  learn  that  a  bbs will survive us  say,  leaving  for a vacation or just
getting  away  for a day. It will operate  fine  even if we don't log on every
hour to check our mail or to check who has logged on. We need to learn that we
MUST  put  it aside at times. If we don't,  there  may come a time we may just
leave it for good.

     The  thing I want us to learn here is that we must be able to control all
extra  things  in  our lives if we are  to  maintain  our sanity or our stress
levels. Too much of anything is not good. I guess the word here is MODERATION.
Don't  be  obsessive  about the bbs. Walk away  at  times. Not that I think we
should  abandon it altogether, but just realize it will still be there when we
get back to it.

     There  are a few things we could do that will give us that time away. How
about   a   very  close  friend  or   relative   that  will  share  the  sysop
responsibilities with you? I have learned that having another person take some
of  the  responsibility does wonders for my out  look of the bbs. A one person
show,  sometimes,  is not the best way  to go. Delegate some duties to others.
There  are those who would be very happy  to assist... Just make sure they are
people  you  can trust. Everyone has someone  they can delegate to. If you are
one  of the rare ones who doesn't, train someone you like that is on your bbs.
Get  to  know them. And try them  out on different responsibilities to see how
they handle them.

     Learn to cope with your stress. Live just one day at a time. Realize that
you  can't do it all in a day. Anything is good doesn't come over night. Don't
worry about it so much. Worrying doesn't solve a thing, it only brings on more
stress and eventual BURNOUT. Toss those things you worry about to other people
you  delegate  to  help you. Once you  delegate  learn  that you still have to
follow  through on your helpers. Here is a little list on delegation which may
help you, it has me.

Identify the project.
Identify who can deal with the project.
Delegate that responsibility to someone you can trust to do it.
Make sure they have the necessary materials to handle it.
Follow through by asking how it is coming, if they are on top of it.
Let it go and don't worry about it.

     Yes,  delegation  is  a  tremendous way  to  aid  in lowering your stress
factor.  Try it! Anyway, I would rather see  that us sysops try to control our
own   situations   by  setting  priorities   and   learning  how  to  delegate
responsibilities than taking down our bbs's.

     So,  in conclusion, do give in to BURNOUT! Prioritize, and delegate where
you can. You will find these are some of the major keys to avoiding the giving
up feeling and keeping your sanity. Hang in there, and let me know if I can be
of further assistance

ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     Some  months  ago I received a free  Racal  Vadic 9632VP modem. The Racal
9632VP isn't listed in Modems.mdm and with Racal's unique service policy where
they  burn  an  eprom according to the  customer's  needs  the modem created a
unique setup problem for putting this modem to use.

     Definitions:  anomaly; a quirk that is a deviation from the expected norm
but does not render a device useless. TOS; Top Of Screen, the user data.

     For  one whole day the old Racal operated flawlessly, then the eprom blew
when  a user changed the baud while online.  BAM! the Racal came offline and I
called  Racal Milgo company for a price  quote of $257.00 to repair or replace
the  modem.  Good  luck  Racal, at that price  I  could  buy a new US Robotics
sportster.  I  caught a user friend of mine  on  the BBS and requested that he
look at the modem, he fixed the eprom for the use of the modem for a month. My
sincere thanks Lucas Nihart for having salvaged my Xmas present.

                                 EPROM CHIPS

     The  eprom  chip is the operating brain in  a  modem. The buyer of a used
modem  may  expect  a  standard "hayes  compatible"  burn,  the reality of the
situation is that you never know what the previous owners have had done to the
hardware setup. A smart move for the buyer of a used modem would be to plug it
in  and  run some diagnostic software  to determine if the non-volatile memory
and the uart chip are operating correctly, particularly if you acquired an old
modem   used  in  a  business.  You   can  acquire  diagnostic  software  made
specifically for this purpose from;

MODEMD51.ZIP,  and MODOC51.ZIP. 51 stands for version 5.1, the latest release
from  the  programmer. This file determines  the  condition of both chips and
spells out the operating standard programed into the eprom.

                     Eprom knowledge learned and applied

     An interesting point about the new genre of modems and eprom chips should
be  mentioned at this point. Some of  these modems have an engineering anomaly
(1)  of  the eprom, this anomaly in the  operation  may cause some of what the
operator  presumes  possible  to be  impossible.  This  anomaly has manifested
itself  before myself within a GVC  corporation manufactured modem which had a
problem switching v42 off and establishing a v22bis at 2400 baud connect, also
a  non v42 9600 baud MNP5 v32 connect. The modem was engineered to utilize the
v42  data  compression  with  MNP5, if switched  off  the  modem had a problem
acquiring  the  connect  parameters as per  the  instructions  of the hayes B1
command. GVC believing that this anomaly was harmless had engineered new soft-
ware  designed  to  operate within  the  hardware  limitations. Eventually the
retailer  replaced  my GVC model 144I modem  with a different model of the GVC
144I.  I  actually believed that GVC had  designed the modem to sell a certain
software, actually they just attempted to capitalize on an anomaly that forced
that  model  of modem to the bargain  bins of the Fingerhut Company mail order
businesses.  The  point here is that you  need a working and predictable eprom
chip  that  you  may command to be  compatible  with  software of your choice.
Again,  the  modem doctor will return whether  your  eprom is a standard hayes
type  or  something from mars. When you  run modem doctor watch the S register
returns for normal results, if modem doctor receives an unusual return it will
send a message to the display.

                      The Racal Vadic 9632VP modems.mdm

     As it is today, my Racal Vadic 9632VP will connect at all baud rates with
or  without MNP 1-5. Below is the current modems.mdm file I have for the Racal
modem, I have since added a 14.4 Infotel to the BBS and now use the Racal on a
different  computer,  but this file works.  Pervious connects with @9680 have
produced  bi-directional transfers of 1300 cps throughput, @9680 uses a Supra
14.4.

     One  more  note...always check your  terminal  software program for which
file number the modem auto-install wrote to, if you don't you might wind up in
a conflict with your BBS modems.dat file when you raise your terminal.

     The  first  few months for a new  sysop  are trying times. At least, they
were  for  me. For the most part, a  new  sysop won't know from what resources
he/she will be able to draw from, and the documentation is not always easy for
the  uninitiated  to understand. Hopefully,  this continuing feature will help
clear  up  some  of the mysteries of running  a  bbs  for new sysops, and also
provide possible sources of information for future questions to be referenced.

     This  first column is designed to help  the new sysop (or any sysop) find
the  right place to go for help. While  Wayne, Filo and Jim are always willing
to  help sysops, it is not always necessary  to go to them for assistance. I'm
sure  that  they enjoy it, but I  imagine it can become overwhelming at times.
Hopefully  after  reading  this, there will  be  a better understanding of the
support  system  that  has  been established for  all  sysops  (new or old) in
IceNET.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         The [ISB] and [IPSS] Systems

     In  the two years that I have been a sysop, there have been some dramatic
improvements  in assisting new sysops. One of the best, in my opinion, was the
revamping  of  the  ISB (IceNET Support Board),  and  the addition of the IPSS
(IceNET  Primary Support System). These systems can be identified by the [ISB]
or  [IPSS] designations following the BBS name.  There are a limited number of
ISB and IPSS systems, ISB systems are limited to 1 system for every 10 systems
while IPSS systems are limited to 1 per 100 systems in the network. This helps
to  ensure  that  each system has been  checked  out,  and can provide quality
assistance to the sysops who come looking for files, and answers to questions.

     All  ISB systems have a Guest Sysop  Account [GSA] for visiting sysops to
log  in under so that they have immediate access to the board. There will also
be  a minimum of 5 megs. of WWIV  related files, and the current BBSLIST.* and
CONNECT.* files available for download.

     IPSS  systems are required to have a sysop with at least one year of WWIV
experience,  30+  megs. of WWIV related  files, including the most recent WWIV
support  files, and will also have  Auto-Sysop Validation [ASV]. I have listed
the IPSS systems below to provide you with a convenient reference.

system.

                      [GSA] and [ASV] Directory

     Another  recent  development  within IceNET  has  been the compilation of
systems  that have ASV (Auto Sysop Validation) and GSA (Guest Sysop Accounts).
Lance  Halle (1@6211) is handling this task for IceNET, and has done his usual
fan-  tastic  job  with it. These systems  allow  other WWIV sysops first call
access  to  the  files  section on their  boards.  The  list  is compiled with
identifiers  to show which systems carry what  type of files, and the quantity
(number  of files). This list may be  obtained straight from the IceNET sysops
conference every month, or you may wish to contact Lance for more information.

     Here  is  the  updated  version  of  the  directory  from  Lance  himself
specifically for IceNEWS:

     NOTE ABOUT MODS: Per Filo's & Wayne's request, MODS and MODNET should NOT
be  available  to first time callers. The  Sysop  needs to verify the caller's
WWIV registration number by verifying it in the BBSLIST.* files of WWIVnet, or
with  Filo (1@2050) BEFORE granting access MODS or MODNET. NOTE: MODNET refers
to  SubType 2370. MODS refers to any  other Sub or Directory that carries WWIV
mods.

                                 Sysop Subs

     One  readily available source of help for any sysop are the numerous subs
designed  specifically for sysops. I won't even  begin to start calling of sub
names  and host, because I'm sure I'll  leave some out accidentally. There are
subs designed to assist the sysop with on-line games, setting up hardware, how
to  attract  new  users,  and the list goes  on  forever.  These subs can be a
valuable  addition to your message area. While your users will never see them,
they can give you valuable insight into many different aspects of running your
bbs.  Just  look at your SUBS.LST file  under  "Of Interest to Sysops" and you
should find something that fits your need.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     I  hope  that  this  has shed a  little  additional  light on some of the
avenues available to sysops that are looking for assistance. In future columns
I  will cover step-by-step procedures for  the different aspects of setting up
and  running WWIV. So far, most of the feedback that I have received has asked
for  assistance in the file transfer section, including protocols, and setting
up CD-Roms for use with WWIV. This will be the focus of the next column.

     Please  send  any comments and questions to me  so  that I can be sure to
cover them in future columns. I look forward to hearing from you.

     One  of  the  major stumbling blocks  of  a computer-related hobby is, of
course,  the inherent expense of purchasing ready made computer equipment. One
way to save money on a new computer is to build it yourself. In this series of
articles,  we'll  discuss  how to build  yourself  a  new computer system from
scratch  and  how to upgrade older systems  to new performance levels. In this
issue: How to decide what you need, and how you can go shopping for it.

     PLEASE  NOTE!! Building your own system will save you money, but not very
much.  You also loose the benefits of technical support, factory burn in, etc.
Therefore, this is advised only for experienced computer people, or those with
access  to  trustful  assistance. This author can  not  be held liable for any
costs  you  may incur while building your  system and also advises that anyone
seriously  interested in building their own system obtain additional reference
material.

     You can't start buying components until you know exactly what you need or
you'll  find yourself either over- or  under-buying. It's generally best to go
over exactly what you'll be using the computer for now, and what you think you
may  end up needing or using it for in the future. Failure to fully plan ahead
for  future  upgrades can really cost you in  the long run. Know what you need
before you even begin to look into buying.

     The first, and most important, thing you need to decide is whether or not
you'll  be  running  Windows  or  OS/2. If  you  have  a  large  amount of DOS
applications  you're using and merely want them  to run faster, then you don't
need  a  screaming  processor.  For  the  purposes  of  future  expansion,  an
80386sx-33 is probably the most you'll want. This gives you the opportunity to
break into Windows later (if you want) and will speed up your DOS applications
a  good bit. It's also the minimum that's commonly available right now, and is
quite  affordable.  If you need to shave a  few  more dollars off, you can dip
down  to a 25, 20, or 16 MHz model. If, on the other hand, you will be running
Windows  and Windows applications from the start, you'll want something in the
486  range. The minimum here is again the 386sx-33, or better a 486sx-20 or 25
processor, going right up to a 486dx2-50 or 66 for extreme performance. A good
midrange  Windows processor is a 386dx-40. This will give you good performance
levels  without breaking your bank. If  you're interested in running OS/2, the
386dx-40  is a good low end model,  although the operating system has been run
successfully on lesser machines.

     Like  the processor, choosing how much memory you'll need depends on what
programs  you'll be running. For a basic DOS system, 1 megabyte is sufficient,
although  two  will  allow  you  to  take  full  advantage  of  DOS  5+ memory
management,  as well as certain programs capable of using above the 640k line.
For  a Windows machine, 2 megabytes is the minimum for the environment to run.
For  most  applications,  as  well as  reasonable  performance,  you'll need 4
megabytes.  Between 6 and 8 will get  you a nice performance increase, and the
ability  to  easily juggle multiple programs. For  an OS/2 system, 4-5 megs is
the bare minimum, and you'll experience a substantial jump in performance with
8  megabytes. The more you can scrape together, the better. If you're going to
try running Windows NT, a minimum of 16 megabytes is recommended.

     Another  question it's appropriate to ask here  is "Will you be running a
BBS?". If you need a machine to handle one node of a board, either on it's own
or  on a network, any processor in the 386 or 386sx range will do. Performance
is acceptable on lower machines, though you will run into some problems. Since
the  prices for low end 386sx machines have dropped a good deal recently, it's
worth  it  to  spring for a 386,  especially  since  the price differential is
almost nil. If you plan on running a BBS under Windows or OS/2, you'll need at
least  a  midrange  Windows machine, as BBS  software  takes a large amount of
processing ability. Anything in the 486 range should suffice with some tuning.
Performance will almost always be less than under DOS, even on 486dx2-66's.

     A  point  you  will also need to  address  is hard disk space. This again
varies with the applications you're running. For a BBS, you can get by with as
little  as 40 meg drive if you'll forgo a large file area. Prices have dropped
so much, however, that it's not cost effective to purchase any less than a 130
meg  drive. For Windows, at least a 130  is the effective minimum if you'll be
using  many Windows applications. In the case of DOS, anything around or above
60 is sufficient. As always, the more the merrier. If you find yourself with a
bit of extra money in the budget, the hard disk is the best place to put it.

     For  a hard disk drive interface, it's  best to go with IDE (which stands
for Intergrated Drive Electronics). These drives are generally cheaper, have a
high   performance   level,  and  are   readily   available.  For  high  speed
applications,  you may want to go with Fast SCSI-2 which allows daisy-chaining
of  up  to 7 devices and has a  much faster data transfer rate than IDE. Other
drive  control  standards  have  fallen by  the  wayside  in recent years, and
shouldn't be considered as serious options.

     If  you're  building  a  system from  scratch,  as  opposed to updating a
pre-existing  system, you'll need to purchase a new case and power supply. The
two are generally sold together. When picking a case, you'll have to take into
account  the number of drives and peripherals you  want to add, as well as the
size of the motherboard you picked. For high end systems you plan on expanding
in  the future, a tower case with at least 6 bays and a 250+ watt power supply
is  the  best  choice. For systems  with  less  lofty aspirations, mini-tower,
desktop,  and  mini-desktop cases suffice. The case  has to be large enough to
hold the motherboard and disk drives, as well as having enough openings in the
back to accommodate all the expansion card slots on the motherboard.

     For  your  video system, you'll want a  minimum  of VGA if you're running
Windows or graphics in DOS. Local Bus, and co-processed cards will get you the
best  performance  levels,  but to save  money  a cheap frame-buffer card will
suffice.  If you're under DOS and don't care  about color, but do want to save
money,  a Hercules-compatible monochrome system will  save you a lot of money.
The  Amber monochrome monitors are great for DOS word processing tasks and for
dedicated  DOS  BBS  systems. It's possible to  run  Windows  on them, but the
resolution  is  sufficiently low that it's not  possible  to do very much with
them.

     Purchase  a monitor according to the type of display system you want. The
size  depends  on  what  you can afford. You  can  often  find  a good deal on
monitor/controller  bundles. With VGA systems, make  sure that the monitor can
handle  a  72hz refresh rate, and has a  dot pitch no greater than .28. If you
find  a  monitor with a 60hz refresh  rate, it's perfectly usable, however, if
you  attempt  to  run  it at high  resolutions  you  will see some flicker and
blurring of lighter colors.

     Every  PC needs a set of serial and parallel ports for communication with
the  outside  world.  If  you're only going  to  be  plugging  in a mouse, for
example,  a  cheap  $10 card will be sufficient.  If  you plan on using a high
speed  modem,  though, you'll need something with  a 16550 UART (the chip that
controls  dialog  between  the PC and  serial  devices).  Running a fast modem
without  one  can be a trying experience.  For  your parallel port, just about
anything  will  do. If you think you'll  be  using LapLink or another parallel
port  data transfer utility, make sure you have a bi-directional parallel port
(most  are,  by this point). If you're  only  dealing with a printer, anything
will  suffice. Generally, the best deal on ports is an "all in one" controller
card.  These  have  floppy,  IDE hard  disk,  serial,  and  parallel ports all
controlled from one card.

     For  diskette drives, keyboards, and  mice, there aren't many guidelines.
Diskette  drives by Teac and NEC are  generally good performers, and you won't
find much cheaper. A decent no-name keyboard can be found just about anywhere,
and $10 Taiwanese mice will work just as well as a $100 Microsoft offering.

     Once  you know what you want, the next step  is to go out and buy it. For
demonstration  purposes,  we'll  assume that  we're  building two computers, a
bare-bones  1 mb monochrome 386sx-33 system with a 130 megabyte hard disk, and
a  486dx2-66  with 16 megabytes and local  bus  video, and a 520 megabyte hard
drive. We'll assume that both will be used with high-speed modems, and use IDE
hard drive interfaces.

     Please  Note: For price examples in this article, I'll be using primarily
two  companies, JDR Microdevices, a computer parts suppliers, and Insight/Hard
Drives  International,  a  general  supplier. While  the  prices  here are not
absolute  rock  bottom, they are on the  low end and both companies are stable
and offer good service and support. If you're interested in cutting costs even
more,  the  back pages of PC  Magazine,  Computer Shopper, and other magazines
often offer rock bottom prices on various components.

     The  rest of the system is molded by the motherboard, so it's a good idea
to  pick that part first. For the high  end dx2-66 system, JDR sells a Modular
Circuit Technology dx2-66 motherboard with two local bus slots, ZIF socket for
Pentium  upgradability, AMI Bios, 8 SIMM  sockets, and a 128kb external cache.
The  board  will fit in full sized or mini  cases. The price is $899. A 33 mhz
version is available for $599. For the low end system, JDR also sells a 33 mhz
386sx motherboard with 6 16-bit expansion slots, 4 SIMM sockets, AMI Bios, and
math co-processor socket. The cost here is only $129.

     The  next  step  is memory. The  dx2-66  motherboard requires SIMMS to be
installed  in multiples of 4, so the best way  to make 8 megabytes is with 4 4
mb  SIMMS,  leaving 4 sockets open  for expansion. SIMM prices are fluctuating
wildly,  but  JDR  charges  $159.95 for  each  module,  bringing  the total to
$639.80.  The  386sx-33  motherboard  requires  that  SIMMS  be  installed  in
multiples  of 2, but since 512k SIMMS are not commonly available, it's best to
use  4  256k  SIMM  modules.  JDR sells these  for  #14.95  a  piece in the 80
nanosecond configurations. 60 nanosecond versions go for 16.95. You need four,
so the total price is $59.80. The drawback here is that you need to remove the
256k  SIMMs to upgrade further. If you have the cash available, it pays to buy
2  1  megabyte  SIMMS  (49.95 a piece from  JDR).  You  pay more, but get more
expandability in the future, have 2 free sockets, and more memory now.

     The  next purchase you need to make is  the case for your new system. JDR
sells  it's "Mini Slide Case" for $69.95,  with an additional $99.95 for a 230
watt  power supply. The case has 3 5.25  inch drive bays, and one vertical 3.5
inch bay. The case will accommodate either motherboard.

     If  you  need something larger, mid-size  upright cases are available for
$99.95  each,  plus power supply. These hold  either two 3.5 inch and two 5.25
inch,  or 3 3.5 inch and 2 5.25 inch. For maximum expandability, a 7 bay tower
case  is  available  for  $99.95 as well,  plus  $129.95  for a 250 watt power
supply. Make sure any case/power supply combination you buy comes with a power
cord.

     It's  best  to  buy hard drives  and  interface  cards together, both for
compatibility  and  some  excellent bundle deals  that  are available. For the
sx-33,  a Seagate 130 mb IDE drive with a 16 bit hard/floppy interface is just
$189 from Insight/Hard Drives International. This gets you the drive (3.5 inch
1"  height,  with  mounting  rails for  mounting  in  5.25  inch slots), other
mounting equipment, an installation guide, a 16 bit IDE controller (capable of
running  two  hard  IDE hard disks), and  two  floppy  drives. The same kit is
available  with  a 540 megabyte drive for  $619.  Insight has a large range of
hard  drives in various sizes. Interestingly  enough, this author runs his BBS
off of one.

     There  isn't much difference between floppy drive prices. Insight and JDR
charge  about  the same, around $60 for each  1.44  or 1.2 mb sizes. For these
systems, we'll assume one drive a piece.

     There's  a  huge array of different  monitors  available. For the low end
system, an Amber monochrome monitor costs $109 from JDR. A Hercules-compatible
monochrome  and  RGB  color graphics card  is  $49.95, and includes a parallel
printer port. I've seen these cards as low as $20 at local computer stores, so
go  ahead  and  shop around. For the 486,  an  MCT  VESA Local-Bus VGA card is
available  from JDR for $199, and is capable  of driving the monitor at 24 bit
color  at 640 by 480 pixel resolution,  with a maximum resolution of 1280x1024
at  16  colors.  The  card  has 1 mb  of  RAM  pre-installed,  and  uses an S3
accelerator  chip.  For a monitor, 17 inch  AOC monitor with .26 dot pitch and
72hz  1024 x 768 NI refresh rate goes for $799. For the more budget conscious,
a 1024x768 14 inch VGA monitor with .39 dot pitch and 87 hz interlaced refresh
rate at 1024x768 (72 hz Non-Interlaced at 640x480) is $269.95.

     For serial and parallel ports, a fast 16550 multi-I/O card (2 Serial with
16550  UARTs, one parallel, and one game  port) is $89.95 from JDR. A cheaper,
lower-performance card (1 serial, 1 parallel, 1 game) is $49.95, with a second
serial port available for $24.95.

     All  that remains is peripherals such as  the keyboard and mouse. For the
mouse,  a  basic Microsoft compatible serial  mouse  is available from JDR for
$14.95.  A  101 key keyboard is available  just about anywhere (JDR offers one
for  $49.95).  You'll  need the full version  of  Microsoft DOS (or PC-DOS, or
Novell DOS), which will cost around $80.

     Congratulations,  you now have all the components  you need for a new PC!

     To  start  off, and to clear  away the initial complexity of programming,
Turbo-C++  (hereby referred to as TC) is not hard to learn and/or use. Now, at
first  sight, the appearance of all  that garbled code and unintelligible word
sequences  is quite overbearing. But you must realize that learning TC (or any
programming  language  for  that  matter) is  almost  like  learning a foreign
language.  However,  instead  of  learning to  use  voice  tones  and new word
structures,  you learn the functions of  the programming language and also how
to "phrase" it.

     I  have  been programming in TC for about  2  and a half years now, and I
know  pretty  much how the basis and  some  higher functions work. For about 2
years  I have been working inside of  WWIV's source code (MUCH credit goes out
to  Wayne  Bell for his excellent programming  ability, and how much it taught
me),  and  lately I have also been working  on  making a door-game for WWIV. I
also  have  attended  several  TC  college  classes,  so  I  I  believe  I  am
knowledgeable  enough to give a small teaching on it. Enough about me, though.
Let's take a look at some of the basics of building a simple program.

     TC  is  basically built on the  manipulation  and creation of information
that,  depending  on  your ability to program,  can  make  a very nice, usable
program.  Some  of the main abilities in  TC is to define strings into certain
arrays: CHAR (characters) and INT (integers, real numbers). Also, these arrays
can  be stored in different ways: STATIC  (Preserves the value of a variable),
DOUBLE  (used only with INT's, allows  for decimals), REGISTER (Store variable
in  CPU register), UNSIGNED (Alter the data  type -not really sure here-), and
many others that aren't immediately necessary to write a simple program.

     Another  important  ability for TC is  the manipulation of files. You can
make  a  program  to open a file, write  data  to it, close it, and re-open to
re-load the data. In my example mini-program I will show how to do this. Let's
take a look at it...

(The text in between /* and */ or behind // are comments, and TC ignores them)

-----MINIPRG.C-----[end here]

     For  the  sake  of  beginning programmers,  I  have  kept  the length and
complexity of MINIPRG.C to a minimum for easier understanding. Now, to explain
a  bit. The main operations in the "mini-program" are to store information for
one  particular  user, write it to the  file 'info.dat', be able to write more
users,  and then retrieve a particular  user entered. The file manipulation in
this program might seem complicated at first, but, as you get more fluent with
the  logic  of  Turbo-C  the  functions will  make  more  sense.  You will see
functions  such  as  'open', 'close', 'write',  and  'read'  alot and they are
pretty self-explanatory. For more help on any specific function of C, just put
the  cursor on the function name, and hit Shift-F1. You will get the functions
purpose, usage, and and example (for most functions at least).

     As  for the more basic functions you will use in most beginning programs,
the  concept  of the 'for' loop, the 'do'  loop,  the 'while' loop, and how to
call a defined function. The 'for' loop basically runs like:

                    ('i' has been defined as an 'int')
                    for(i=0;i<10;i++) {
                     printf("%d",i);
                    }

     What  that  will  do is print out the  numbers  0 through 10. The loop is
saying  that  'i' equals 0 to begin with,  to keep running the loop as long as
'i'  is less than 10, and for the value  of 'i' to increase by 1 each time the
loop  is  run. In a while loop, it  would look like this (also contains a 'do'
loop):

                    ('s' has been defined as a 'char[81]')
                    do {
                    scanf("%s",s);
                     while((s[0]=0)!=0) {
                     scanf("%s",s);
                     }
                    } while(s[0]!=0);

     What  this  will do is have the user  input  's' (the [81] after the char
means  that  the  longest  the string in 's'  can  be  is 81 characters (it is
actually  0  to 80, the 81st character  is  a null-pointer to end the string))
and,  if the user just hits return and doesn't input anything, he will have to
re-input  it.  The do loop implemented means  that  the loop will run at least
once,  the last 'while' statement is only needed when using a 'do' loop, it is
the clause for the loop.

     Now,  the most basic ability (I think at  least) in C++: the calling of a
defined  'void', 'int', or 'char' function. If  the function is defined by you
(such as the 'save_stuff' function in MINIPRG.C) you will need to define it at
the top of the file such as this:

                              ...
                              #include <io.h>

                              void save_stuff(void);
                              ...

     And to call the function, all that is needed is: 'save_stuff()'. I stated
that  fact  because  I knew someone who was  taking  a  basic level C class in
college  and  for  weeks did not know how  to  do that. To learn how to define
functions, refer to MINIPRG.C, as it is shown there.

     Well,  hopefully  this little tutorial helped  you  somewhat, if not, you
still got a neat little program.

     or "I Did It MY Way"

               "You ask me if I have a God complex. I AM God."
            - Alec Baldwin in commercials for the film "Malice" -

     We've  all  heard the horror stories.  Accounts  deleted for "no reason."
Mail  from users being routinely ignored or just plain "zapped" without reply.
New  user  accounts remaining unvalidated  for weeks, sometimes months. Sudden
loss  of carrier from the BBS, then a busy signal when redialing is attempted.
Seventy-five  line  posts from the #1 account  on  a daily basis explaining in
excruciatingly  exact  detail  just why he/she  holds  the #1 account and what
he/she  can do to those who dare to oppose. I am, of course, talking about the
sysop.  More  precisely,  the  sysop  with  an  attitude.  If  you continually
experience  any or all of the potential  symptoms I've outlined above, you may
have found yourself a sysop with a "SysGod" complex.

     The  SysGod  complex  can best be described  as  a habitual misuse of the
powers  vested in being a sysop for  reasons of pleasure or personal gain. The
complex  causes  the sysop to act in  a manner that would suggest delusions of
godhood  and  a semi-divine detachment, thus  alienating  his/her users to the
point  of them no longer calling the BBS.  The complex can be broken down into
two categories: "Demi-SysGod Syndrome" [DSS] and "Holy SysGod Syndrome" [HSS].

     Believe  it  or not, in most cases  of  DSS, the afflicted sysops usually
started  their BBS with all the best of  intentions, and in most cases used to
be  a  "regular"  user prior to  becoming  a sysop. But, apparently, somewhere
along  the  way something happens to them.  Maybe it's the fact that running a
BBS  is  more of a task than  they  thought it was. Maybe they're experiencing
personal  problems.  Maybe their pet goldfish  died.  Somewhere down the line,
they  experience  a "break" in their attitude as  a sysop. A kind of a digital
"Falling  Down,"  if  you  will,  where they  start  to  vent  their anger and
frustrations  out  onto their users. When  detected early, most of these cases
manage  to  correct  themselves  in a  relatively  short  time and with little
lasting  repercussions to their users. Once a sense of normalcy returns to the
sysop's life, so too does it to the BBS in most cases.

     HSS sufferers, on the other hand, while also usually being users prior to
becoming  sysops,  also  generally  suffer  from  other  outside, pre-existing
personality  disorders.  As  regular  users  (and  I  use  the  term "regular"
loosely),  they often acted in "irregular" manners that most would describe as
being  combative,  disrespectful, disagreeable,  belligerent, and/or offensive
toward  others.  Typically, they are the type  of user who feels that they are
"God's  gift  to  BBSs" or a form of  "Modem  Messiah" and anyone else who has
differing  ideas  or ideals is irrelevant  and only there for his/her personal
amusement.  They  are  usually  shallow,  close-minded  individuals  who quite
probably  used  to be (or still are)  either  the school, neighborhood or work
bully.  Mostly,  their  motivation to start their  own  BBS  is based on their
feelings  that  "All of the other 35 BBSs I  call suck, so I'll make one in my
own  image  with my own rules and  forget  everyone else." While HSS sufferers
make  up  only a small minority of  those  who suffer from the SysGod complex,
they  are the one's who draw all  the scrutiny from others as their affliction
is usually chronic in nature and long in duration.

     One  of  the saddest things about  this  affliction is that everyone, not
just  the  sysop, suffers because of the  effects  of the SysGod complex. This
includes  the BBS itself. Many times, in  fits of rage and delirium, they will
make  changes to the BBS itself to reflect their newfound divine philosophy in
the  way  of allowing certain policies,  adding  particular subs that normally
wouldn't  be  carried,  deleting  files  or  users,  regularly interrupting or
kicking  users offline in order to allow the SysGod to access the computer for
things like playing games, viewing adult .GIFs, calling other BBSs and leaving
posts saying how much that system sucks and how great his system is, etc. As a
result,  the users will slowly start to  disappear as they either stop calling
back  or are deleted by the sysop. Eventually, the BBS will receive sufficient
bad word-of-mouth publicity as to discourage new callers from logging on.

     In  order to better understand the psyche of those who suffer from HSS, I
decided  to look for a local BBS that is run by an afflicted sysop and give it
a  call.  After searching the advertisement  subs  of several local systems, I
found the following ad:

                               CALL HERE!!!!!!

                   MY DAMN BBS (Sysop: The All-Powerful 1)

               If you don't call "My Damn BBS," you're a chump.

                      Nine months old and going strong.

     As  this  looked  like a good potential  candidate  for a HSS sufferer, I
called.  Here  is  the  capture file I ran  while  online  at  My Damn BBS. My
personal notes written later appear in [brackets].

Too damn bad, we don't have one here.

     [At  this point, I was somewhat certain  that I'd reached a HSS sufferer,
but  some  doubts  still remained. Those,  however,  were  washed away by what
followed  next. At this juncture, one would  expect to see a system rules file
and/or a legal disclaimer. Here's what I got:]


                          >>Welcome To My Damn BBS<<

My Damn BBS was started because I felt that all the other sysops in the area
are [CENSORED]. So I leeched a copy of WWIV from somebody and started by own
BBS. My motto here is: If you don't like it, too damn bad. Since this
BBS is run on by damn computer, I'm gonna run this place the way I want to and
nobody better tell me any different.

Here's my damn rules for My Damn BBS:

Don't bother trying to chat with me about any of your problems as I got enough
of my own to deal with and shouldn't have to deal with yours too. If you leave
me mail, I might get around to answering it someday if I find it interesting
and relevant, but don't hold your breath. If you don't like it, too damn bad.

If you have problems with using the BBS software, don't bug me for help. I had
to learn once too, you know, and nobody showed me how to do it. If you can't
figure it out for yourself, that's your problem. If you don't like it, too
damn bad.

If you want to swear here, that's fine with me. I'm sure it's nothing I
haven't heard or said already anyway. Cuss all you want. If you've got virgin
ears and don't like it, too damn bad.

Don't bother asking me for files that I have backed-up offline in the transfer
section. I've got "Castle Commando II," "Rocket Jockey IV," and "The Further
Adventures of Happy Henry Hedonist in the Land of the Sexually Explicit Women
Who'll Never Sleep With Him" taking up 85 megs on my BBS HD, so I don't have
the room for them. And I'm not going to clear-up any HD space just for YOU.
This is >>My<< Damn BBS, and if you don't like it, too damn bad.

Don't pester me for more time to download files. If you've got a 14.4 modem,
you should be able to get whatever you want in the 20 minutes I give you
online. If the file is too big and you don't like it, too damn bad. If you
call at any speed less than 14.4 and you want more D/L time, too damn bad,
get a 14.4 modem and I'll start to think about it. Maybe.

Don't post anything contradictory to whatever I post. I'll either delete it or
flame you, probably both. If you get me riled-up enough, I'll delete your
account and throw your name into my trashcan.txt file. Remember, since I've
got the #1 account here, whatever I say is law and whatever I want to do, I'll
do. If you don't like it, too damn bad.

These are the rules for MY Damn BBS. If you don't like them, too damn bad,
press ALT-H to hang up now since you obviously disagree with me and users here
aren't allowed to disagree with me.

Continue to logon? Y/N Y

     [At  this  point, I was fully convinced  I had encountered a sysop with a
particularly  advanced  case  of  HSS,  one  which  looked  terminal  for this
sufferer. Sadly, my initial diagnosis for this patient is that he suffers from
a  not-so-rare  form  of HSS in the  manifestation  of  a "Ptolemy complex" in
which,  as the name suggests, he sincerely believes that the universe (and his
BBS  in particular) does indeed revolve around him, and not vice-versa. On the
average,  about  70-75%  of HSS sufferers  also  are  afflicted with a Ptolemy
complex.  Medical science is currently at a loss to explain the cause for such
conditions and attempts at treatment are usually unsuccessful.]

     [I  decided  that,  in the interest  of  getting better insight into this
ailment,  I needed to logon to this system to further see just how far the HSS
had  manifested  itself.  I  also  decided  that,  given  the  nature  of this
particular  case, it would be best for me  to logon under an assumed name with
bogus  user info. While considered unethical  from a journalistic and a BBSing
point  of view, I felt safer personally, since  I don't want this loop to ever
know who I really am. I feel that, to paraphrase his own inspired words, if he
don't  like that, too damn bad. Following my logon info, I sent the obligatory
new  user  feedback to The All-Powerful 1  to  reflect my bogus statistics and
stated  that  I'm  just  a general user  looking  to  check  out his BBS. Upon
completion  of  that, I glean my next view  of the effects of HSS on the sysop
and his particular BBS as the logon continues.]

     [Things  don't look too good so far. Considering that his BBS has been up
(supposedly)  for 9 months, 281 calls is pretty sparse business. Also, since I
called  at  around 10 pm and I'm only  the  third caller for the day, it looks
like there's not too much activity in these parts. I can't imagine why. I also
don't see a user number higher than 4. Strange. Let us continue on:]

Well, I finally got this piece of [CENSORED] up and running. I hope you're all
happy now. I know I am. I've finally got my own little stomping ground and I
plan on stomping anyone who gets in my way here. If you don't like it, tough

BTW = The board will be down for the entire month of April because that's when
Star Shooter XXIII comes out and I won't have enough room on my HD for both
the game and the BBS. Whenever I get thru with the game, I'll put the board
back up. Maybe. If you're lucky. If you don't like it, too damn bad.

NO CARRIER

     [Man!  That's a pretty generous helping  of line noise there! My computer
was  beeping out the pc speaker big-time on that dosage of dumping. It's quite
possible  that this sufferer has installed a combination line noise generating
nuke mod built into his system. As if it's not simple enough to just hit F5 to
dump  a user off the system, this guy needs special line noise key to give the
act  a true meaning of personal satisfaction. Looks like this sufferer has got
something  better to do with his system than  to allow me (or others, for that
matter) to use it. Upon redialing, the line was busy. Why am I not surprised?]

     [After three hours of solid war-dialing, I finally managed to get back on
the system. After going through my logon, I see the following:]

        Hi there. Sorry to trouble you, but I am a new user here and recently
experienced a problem when I was on your system earlier tonight. I was just
looking around when I suddenly lost carrier. I was wondering if this was due
to a problem on your end, or if it was a problem with my terminal program. I
don't have call-waiting or an extension phone on this line that I call out
with, so I'm kind of puzzled by the dropped carrier problem. Can you enlighten
me?

Thank for any help.

The All-Powerful 1 is Here:

Hey! What's your problem, buddy?


     [Well,  I expected a response to my  letter, but not THIS fast! Let's see
what he has to say:]


Hello. I'm not sure what the problem is, if it's with my software or if it's
on your end. I was on earlier this evening and

I know, dammit. don't you think I saw the mail you sent me? So, what's your
point?

Well, I was wondering if you were around when I lost carrier here earlier and
saw what happened. Did your board hang? I saw by the daily log that nobody
else been on the system since I lost carrier.


     [I  deliberately gave him an "out" in  my question by suggesting that the
board  might have locked-up. This was my way to finally determine once and for
all  if  he  was indeed suffering from HSS.  If  he  was, he wouldn't take the
escape that I gave him, instead opting to blather something to the effect that
it was "his" system and if I didn't like it, then that was too damn bad.]


Hey! I had to do something on the computer. You got a problem with that? What
are you, some kind of [CENSORED] troublemaker?

No, I'm not trying to cause a problem, I just asked a question. If you needed
to use the computer, you could have just popped in on me in chat mode like you
are now and ask me to logoff. I would've done it. There was no need to hang up
on me.

        [Well, I think that settles it. I decided to try one more time calling
back to see just how badly my little comment had affected this guy.]

     I think it's safe to say that My Damn BBS isn't going to be long for this
world,  so long as The All-Powerful 1 is the sysop. What you've seen here is a
rare glimpse of a sysop who suffers from an extreme case of SysGod Complex. As
I stated earlier, cases such as the one documented above are relatively few in
numbers  but  I think you can see that  while they are few, they also have the
potential to be very acute.

     Medical  science  has  thus  far been unable  to  find  a  cause for this
ailment,  let  alone  a  cure. Unless the  disease  is  caught in its earliest
stages, it is ultimately fatal to a sysop and his/her BBS. Like rubber-neckers
gawking  at a car wreck while passing it on the highway, there's little anyone
can do or say except "What a shame. I wonder what happened."

     The  best way to protect yourself from  the ravages of the SysGod Complex
is to know the tell-tale warning signs:

     -=- Repeatedly hanging-up on your users
     -=- Repeatedly taking the board down for your own uses
     -=- Chronically ignoring e-mail from your users
     -=- Deleting users who question or disagree with you
     -=- Continually telling your users that the board is "mine"

     If  you notice any of these potential  warning signs in yourself, you may
be  at risk of having one of the two complexes. The best way to tell is to put
up  a public post on the board asking  the opinion of your users on how you're
running  the system. If you see a noticeable number of negative posts, you may
have a problem. If you then begin to delete these posts and the users who made
them, then you DEFINITELY are suffering from either DSS or HSS.

     Once  you are diagnosed with having  a SysGod complex, the only treatment
can  come from within. YOU must be the  one who treats the disease by changing
your  habits and starting to act more responsibly toward your users, your BBS,
and yourself.

     Hopefully,  this article will help to illuminate others to the effects of
SysGod  Syndrome  and, perhaps, may save  others  from succumbing to this most
dreaded of afflictions. For only through effective education and communication
can this monstrous malady ever be eradicated.
