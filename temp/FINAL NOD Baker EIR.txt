EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ES.1 Introduction 
The Irvine Ranch Water District (IRWD) has prep
ared this Environmental Impact Report (EIR) 
to provide the public, responsible and trustee 
agencies and IRWD decision-makers information 
about the potential adverse effects on the lo
cal and regional environment associated with 
construction and operation of the 
Baker Water Treatment Plant (WTP) Project (proposed project). 
This EIR has been prepared pursuant to the 
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). 
The proposed Baker WTP would have a normal 
operating capacity of 43.5 cfs (28 mgd) and 
would treat raw water from variable supply s
ources. The proposed Baker WTP would provide redundant treatment capacity to 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California™s (MWD) 
Diemer Treatment Plant. The project would not 
increase the capacity of regional treated water 
distribution pipelines, but rather improve regiona
l potable water system 
reliability and operational 
flexibility. As described in Chapter 1, the Bake
r WTP would provide treat
ed water to IRWD and four partner water agencies in southern Ora
nge County: El Toro Water District (ETWD), 
Moulton Niguel Water District (MNWD), Santa Margarita Water District (SMWD), and Trabuco Canyon Water District (TCWD). In addition to the Baker WTP, the proposed project also would 

include a new offsite pump station near Peters Ca
nyon Reservoir; a meter exchange and pipeline 
replacement at OC-33; a new sewer pipeline to convey non-reclaimable wastewater (NRW) from 
the Baker WTP to IRWD™s sanitary sewer system; and may include new pipelines to convey 

treated water from the Baker WTP to the South County Pipeline. 
 This Executive Summary provides an overview 
of the proposed project, its objectives, and a 
summary of the potential impacts anticipated as a 
result of project implementation. The summary 
table (Table ES-1) included at the end of this chapte
r identifies these impacts and lists the 
mitigation measures recommended to reduce signifi
cant adverse impacts. Alternatives to the 
proposed project are also briefly described. 
For a full description of the proposed project, its
 impacts, and alternatives, please refer to 
Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this EIR. 
ES.2 Background IRWD was established in 1961 as a California Wa
ter District pursuant to the California Water District Law (California Water Code, Division 13
). IRWD provides potable and recycled water, 
sewage collection and treatment, and urban runoff treatment to municipal and industrial (M&I) 

and agricultural customers within an 115,531-acre 
service area in Orange County, California. The 
IRWD service area includes all of the City of Irvine and portions of Tustin, Newport Beach, 
Executive Summary 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 ES-2 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
Costa Mesa, Orange and Lake Forest. Currently, 75
 to 80 percent of the water IRWD provides for 
its customers comes from local sources, including
 groundwater (produced from the groundwater 
basin managed by Orange County Water District), surface water, and recycled water (from 

IRWD™s Michelson and Los Alisos Water Recyclin
g Plants). Less than 25 percent of IRWD™s 
water supply is imported by MWD and purchased by
 IRWD through the Municipal Water District 
of Orange County (MWDOC). MWD imports water 
through both the State Water Project (SWP) 
and the Colorado River Aqueduct systems.  
In 2001, IRWD completed a consolidation with 
Los Alisos Water District (LAWD), which served 
portions of the City of Lake Forest. The existi
ng Baker Filtration Plant (BFP), located on Wisteria 
in Lake Forest, was one of the facilities owned 
and operated by LAWD that is now owned by 
IRWD. The BFP was operational from 1971 to 1
983, and was decommissioned when the Allen-
McColloch Pipeline was constructed. All BFP facilities are currently non-operational although 
remain onsite, including reservoirs, a filter plant,
 pump stations, and storage/office building. 
IRWD has additional facilities in and around th
e BFP site that provide filtered water as a 
supplement to its recycled water system. 
ES.3 Project Objectives  The proposed Baker WTP is a regional project that is intended to: 
 Improve water reliability to areas of south Or
ange County by constructing local treatment 
capability for a variable supply source (imported water from MWD and local Irvine Lake 

water). 
 Provide a reliable, local potable water supply in the event of emergency conditions or 
scheduled maintenance of MWD™s delivery system. 
 Increase operational flexibility by creati
ng redundancy within the raw water supply 
system. 
ES.4 Project Description Raw Water Supply and Conveyance 
The raw water sources for the proposed project include imported water supplied by MWD or 

local surface water from Irvine Lake. Both raw 
water sources would be conveyed using existing 
pipeline facilities, including the Lower Feeder, Santiago Lateral, Baker Pipeline, and Irvine Lake 
Pipeline. Imported raw water would enter the Sa
ntiago Lateral from the Lower Feeder upstream 
of the Diemer Filtration Plant. Then, raw wate
r would enter the Baker Pipeline from the Santiago 
Lateral at the OC-33 turnout. The proposed project
 includes a meter exchange within the existing 
concrete vault at OC-33 and replacement of a short segment of pipeline at OC-33 as well. 
Raw water from Irvine Lake would be used interm
ittently throughout the year and in the event of 
an outage of the Lower Feeder or Santiago Latera
l. Irvine Lake is fed by Santiago Creek and 
water imported through the Santiago Lateral. The la
ke captures approximately 7,000 acre-feet of 
local runoff per year (RBF/Carollo, 2010). IRWD is
 a partial owner of the lake together with 
Serrano Water District. IRWD currently supplies untreated water from Irvine Lake to irrigation 
customers. To deliver water from Irvine Lake to 
the Baker Pipeline, a new pump station would be 
Executive Summary 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 ES-3 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
constructed at the existing Baker/Irvine Lake Pi
peline Intertie Facility near Peters Canyon 
Reservoir. The pump station would transfer water from the Irvine Lake Pipeline to the Baker 

Pipeline. The pump station would be aboveground 
and would be designed with a similar aesthetic 
and architecture as the existing neighboring buildings onsite. 
Baker WTP 
Raw water would be treated at the proposed Baker 
WTP, which would be located at the site of the 
existing BFP. The Baker WTP would have a nor
mal operating capacity of about 43.5 cfs (28 
mgd). Raw water treatment would consist of 
membrane filtration, ultraviolet light for 
disinfection, and chloramination for secondary 
or residual disinfection (RBF/Carollo, 2010). 
 The proposed project would require demolition of
 some existing aboveground facilities at the 
BFP. The following new facilities would be 
constructed at the proposed Baker WTP: 
  Raw Water Conveyance Facilities:
 flow control facility, TCWD pump station, forebay, 
feed water strainers, feed water pump station; and about 1,000 feet of new 42-inch feed 

water pipeline.  Treatment Facilities:
 treatment building to house membrane filters and UV facilities, 
disinfection facility, backwash water treatment
 facilities, chemical storage building, 
standby generator, electrical equipment. 
 Treated Water Facilities: product water pump station, su
rge tanks, standby generator, 
electrical equipment, new 36-inch and 42-i
nch product water pipelines, meter vault. 
 Emergency Overflow Facilities: 
42-inch pipeline and discharge structure to convey 
overflow water from the forebay and di
sinfection facility to Serrano Creek. 
  Site Access Facilities:  
access during construction via Biscayne Bay Drive and existing 
access road; access during plant operation via 
Palmwood/Wisteria, Biscayne Bay Drive, 
and/or Indian Ocean Avenue; Wisteria 
gate relocation and new security fencing. The aboveground Baker WTP facilities would be 
designed to be compatible with existing 
buildings onsite at the BFP. The architectural 
theme would include concrete masonry unit (CMU) 
block walls, steel deck roofs, and aluminum 
frame doors and windows (RBF/Carollo, 2010). The 
building designs would attenuate the sound levels 
of mechanical equipment to be in compliance 
with City of Lake Forest noise ordinances at 
the Baker WTP property line. The proposed Baker 
WTP would require a computerized supervisory co
ntrol and data acquisition (SCADA) system to 
allow for remote control and monitoring of equipment, in addition to local control and 

monitoring. The Baker WTP SCADA system would be
 integrated into IRWD™s existing district-
wide SCADA system, which is used to co
mmunicate with IRWD facilities and ensure 
coordination and proper operation of IRWD f
acilities and systems throughout the service area. 
Operation of the Baker WTP SCADA system may require minor alterations to the existing 

antennae tower, which currently is part of IRWD™s existing district-wide SCADA system.
 Approximately 0.6 mgd of NRW would be gene
rated at the proposed Baker WTP and conveyed 
to the IRWD sanitary sewer system. A new sewer 
connection at the southeastern corner of the 
Baker site would be necessary, as well as a new sewer pipeline. Approximately 2,500 linear feet 

of new 15-inch sewer pipeline would be installe
d along the Serrano Creek Trail in the City of

Lake Forest to connect to an existing 15-in
ch sewer pipeline with adequate capacity. The 
proposed sewer pipeline alignment would be locat
ed within an existing 15-foot utility easement 
owned by IRWD. NRW would be conveyed to IR
WD™s Los Alisos Water Recycling Plant for 
treatment.
 Treated Water Conveyance 
Treated water from the Baker WTP would flow 
by gravity to IRWD customers through its 
existing distribution system. Treated water w
ould be conveyed to ETWD, MNWD, SMWD, and 
TCWD through a new pipeline connection to either the AMP or South County Pipeline (SCP). 

The preferred method of delivering water to the 
partner agencies would be through an existing 
connection to the AMP on the Baker WTP property.
 IRWD is currently coordinating with MWD 
for use of the AMP. If the AMP alternative is 
unable to be implemented, then IRWD would 
construct a new pipeline connecting the Baker 
WTP to the SCP. IRWD is considering two 
pipeline alignments to connect to the SCP. 
ES.5 Project Alternatives 
CEQA requires that ﬁ
an EIR shall describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or 
to the location of the project, which would feas
ibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project–.ﬂ
 (CEQA Guidelines, Section 15126.6 (a)). The discussion must focus on alternatives to the project 
or its location that are capable of lessening signi
ficant impacts, even if these alternatives would 
impede, to some degree, the attainment of project
 objectives, or if they would be more costly 
(Section 15126.6 (b)). The EIR is required to 
briefly describe the rationale for selecting the 
alternatives to be discussed and also identify any 
alternatives that were considered by the Lead 
Agency, but were rejected as infeasible during the scoping process. 
The specific alternative of ﬁNo Projectﬂ shall 
be evaluated along with its impact. If the ﬁNo 
Projectﬂ alternative is determined to be the envi
ronmentally superior alternative, the EIR shall 
also identify an environmentally superior
 alternative among the other alternatives. 
Two alternatives analyzed in this EIR are summari
zed below and are examined in greater detail in 
Chapter 6. The alternatives are an
alyzed even though the proposed project would not result in any 
significant effects. 

Under the No Project Alternative, IRWD would not implement the proposed project; there would 
be no construction of the proposed Raw Water Pump
 Station, Baker WTP, sewer pipeline, treated 
water conveyance pipeline, or OC-33 meter exch
ange. The Baker site would remain unchanged 
and the Baker/Irvine Lake Pipeline Intertie also would remain unchanged. The BFP would 
continue to provide filtered well water to suppl
ement IRWD™s recycled water system and the 
antennae tower would continue to operate as part of IRWD™s existing district-wide SCADA 
system. The Diemer Filtration Plant would continue to provide treatment for imported water for 

IRWD and the partner agencies in south Ora
nge County. Raw water in Irvine Lake would 
continue to be utilized for agricultural irrigation. 
Executive Summary 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 ES-5 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
Under the No Project Alternative, none of the 
project objectives would be achieved. There would 
be no improvements to water supply reliability in 
south Orange County, no increase in local water 
treatment capability for variable supply sources, 
and no redundancy in raw water supply systems 
to provide operational flexibility. In addition, 
none of the environmental impacts identified in 
Chapters 3 and 4 of this Draft EIR that are 
associated with construction and operation of the 
proposed project would occur.  

In 2007, the Santiago Aqueduct Commission (SAC) prepared the 
Baker Pipeline Regional Treatment Facility Feasibility Study (Malcolm Pirnie, 2007), which evaluated implementation of 
a regional WTP at two locations, the existing Bake
r site and the Peters Canyon WTP. Alternative 
1 consists of development of th
e Peters Canyon WTP, which is 
owned by the East Orange County 
Water District (EOCWD) and is located in the C
ounty of Orange approximately 0.35 miles east 
of Peters Canyon Reservoir. The site is surroun
ded by open space in the foothills of the Santa 
Ana Mountains and is within the boundaries of the Loma Ridge portion of the Irvine Ranch 

Natural Landmark. Under Alternative 1, IRWD would form a Joint Powers Authority (JPA) or 
otherwise contract with EOCWD for use of 
the Peters Canyon WTP site and implement 
improvements similar to the proposed project, to
 produce 28 mgd of treated water using either 
imported water or Irvine Lake water as the raw 
water source. Alternative 1 would require a 
reconnection to the Baker pipeline and an extens
ion of the Irvine Lake Pipeline under SR-261 to 
convey Irvine Lake water to the site. 
Alternative 1 would meet all of the goals of the pr
oject but would result in greater or more severe 
impacts to the environment related to aesthetics,
 air quality, biological resources, land use 
compatibility, energy and greenhouse gas emissions. 
Alternative 1 would result in lesser impacts 
associated with hazardous materials and noise.   

The 2007 Feasibility Study (Malcolm Pirnie, 200
7) evaluated conventional treatment as an alternative to membrane filtration. Under Altern
ative 2, IRWD would construct a new treatment 
plant at the Baker site using a conventional treatment process instead of a membrane filtration 
process. A conventional treatment process typi
cally would require facilities such as primary 
treatment facilities (flocculation and sedimentation basins), secondary filtration facilities, 

disinfection facilities (chlorine contactor, UV facility
), an equalization basin, and solids handling 
facilities (thickener, belt filter presses, solids dis
posal). Conventional treatment requires a larger 
footprint than a membrane filtration process, requires more chemical use and has greater sludge 

disposal requirements, and is slightly more
 expensive to build, operate, and maintain. 
Although Alternative 2 would meet all of the goals
 of the project, as compared to the proposed 
project, Alternative 2 would result in greater imp
acts to the environment related to aesthetics, air 
quality (construction impacts), odor, hazardous ma
terials, and noise. As compared to the 
proposed project, Alternative 2 would result in
 fewer operational impacts to energy and 
greenhouse gas emissions.   
Executive Summary 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 ES-6 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
The alternatives evaluated in Chapter 6 of this
 EIR present a tradeoff between achieving project 
objectives and impacting the environment. The 
No Project Alternative would avoid all the 
environmental impacts of the proposed project but would not meet any of the project objectives. 

Alternatives 1 and 2 would meet all of the project
 objectives but could result in additional impacts 
to the environment relative to the proposed project. 
An EIR must identify the environmentally superior alternative. In addition, the 
CEQA Guidelines
 (Section 15126.6(e)(2)) require that, if the environmentally superior alternative is the No Project 
Alternative, the EIR shall also identify an envi
ronmentally superior alternative among the other 
alternatives.  
The No Project Alternative would result in the 
least environmental impacts because there would 
be no physical changes to the environment as a result of the proposed project. All impacts 

associated with the proposed project would be a
voided. As a result, the No Project Alternative 
could be considered the environmentally superior
 alternative, and therefore, in accordance with 
CEQA, an environmentally superior alternative 
shall be identified among the other alternatives. 
Alternatives 1 and 2 would not likely result in 
significant and unavoidable impacts. However, 
both would increase the severity of impacts associated with some environmental resources while 

decreasing impacts associated with others. Fo
r Alternatives 1 and 2, the increase in potential 
environmental impacts outweighs the potential 
decrease in impacts wh
en compared to the 
proposed project. Therefore, the proposed project 
is considered the Environmentally Superior 
Alternative. ES.6 Summary of Impacts 
Table ES-1, at the end of this chapter, presents a summary of the impacts and mitigation 
measures identified for the proposed project. The 
complete discussion of impacts is presented in 
Chapter 3, Environmental Setting, Impacts, a
nd Mitigation Measures. The level of significance for each impact is determined using significance 
criteria (thresholds) developed for each category 
of impacts; these criteria are presented in the 
appropriate sections of Chapter 3. Significant 
impacts are those adverse environmental impacts th
at meet or exceed the significance thresholds; 
less than significant impacts would not exceed th
e thresholds. Table ES-1 indicates the measures 
that would be implemented to avoid, minimize, or otherwise reduce significant impacts to a less 

than significant level ES.7 Areas of Known Controversy Section 15123 (b)(2) of the 
CEQA Guidelines requires that an EIR summary identify areas of 
controversy known to the Lead Agency, including 
issues raised by other agencies and the public.  
On May 18, 2010, a Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the proposed project was distributed by the 
IRWD to the State Clearinghouse, interested agencies, and the public. Responses to the NOP were 

received by the following agencies: the City of Lake
 Forest, the City of Orange, the Department of

Final EIR 
April 2011 
CHAPTER 1 1.0 Introduction Irvine Ranch Water District (IRWD), as the 
Lead Agency pursuant to the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), is proposing 
to construct the Baker Water Treatment Plant 
(WTP) on the site of the existing Baker Filtration Pl
ant in the City of Lake Forest. The proposed 
project would provide increased water supply relia
bility in southern Orange County by creating 
redundancy of treatment system capacity and dist
ribution infrastructure for potable water. The 
proposed Baker WTP would have a normal operati
ng capacity of approximately 43.5 cubic feet 
per second (cfs), or 28 million gallons per day 
(mgd), of raw water. The Baker WTP would 
provide treated water to IRWD customers and to 
the following retail water agencies in southern 
Orange County: El Toro Water District (ETWD), Moulton Niguel Water District (MNWD), Santa 

Margarita Water District (SMWD), and Trabuco Canyon Water District (TCWD) (Figure 1-1). These participating agencies, along with Municipa
l Water District of Orange County (MWDOC) 
and Metropolitan Water District of Southern Calif
ornia, are considered Responsible Agencies pursuant to CEQA. In addition to the Baker WTP, the proposed project also would include a new 

offsite pump station near Peters Canyon Reservoir;
 a meter exchange and pipeline replacement at 
OC-33; new non-reclaimable wastewater (NRW) pipelines to convey NRW from the Baker WTP 

to IRWD™s sanitary sewer system; and either 
a new treated-water connection to the Allen-
McColloch Pipeline or a new pipeline to convey treated water from the Baker WTP to the South 

County Pipeline (SCP).  
1.1 Purpose of the EIR IRWD has prepared this Draft Environmental 
Impact Report (Draft EIR) assessing potential 
adverse effects on the local and regional environm
ent associated with construction and operation 
of the Baker WTP (proposed project). This Dr
aft EIR has been prepared pursuant to the 
California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (
as amended), codified at California Public 
Resources Code Sections 21000 et. seq., and the 
CEQA Guidelines in the Code of Regulations, 
Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3. 
This Draft EIR describes the environmental impacts of the proposed project and suggests mitigation 
measures where necessary to reduce impacts to a less
 than significant level. The impact analyses 
are based on a variety of sources, including agency 
consultation, technical studies and field surveys. 
IRWD will use this EIR to consider implementa
tion of the proposed project. As Lead Agency, IRWD may use this EIR to approve the proposed
 project, make Findings regarding identified 
impacts, and if necessary, adopt a Statement of Ov
erriding Considerations regarding these impacts.

prepared by IRWD and sent to the State Clearinghouse. Copies of the NOP were made available 
for public review at the Orange County Public Libr
ary, El Toro Branch in Lake Forest, the City 
of Orange Public Library, 
and IRWD™s internet site.  The NOP provided a general description of the facilities associated with the proposed project, a 
summary of the probable environmental effects of the project to be addressed in the EIR, and a 

figure showing the project location. The NOP provided the public and interested public agencies 

with the opportunity to review the proposed project and to provide comments or concerns on the 

scope and content of the environmental revi
ew document including: the range of actions; 
alternatives; mitigation measures, and significant e
ffects to be analyzed in depth in the EIR. 
The 30-day project scoping period, which began with the distribution of the NOP, remained open 
through June 17, 2010. 
CEQA recommends conducting early coordination 
with the general public, appropriate public 
agencies, and local jurisdictions to assist in developing the scope of the environmental document. 
Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines
 §15083, a public scoping meeting was held on May 26, 2010 to 
allow agency consultation and public involvement 
for the Draft EIR at IRWD in Irvine. Public 
notices were placed in local newspapers informi
ng the general public of the scoping meetings and 
the availability of the NOP. Public notices also were mailed directly to residents in the immediate 
vicinity of the Baker site to inform them of the scoping meeting and the availability of the NOP. 

The purpose of the meetings was to present to th
e public the proposed project and its potential environmental impacts. Attendees were provided 
an opportunity to voice comments or concerns 
regarding potential effects of the proposed project.   
The comments received during the NOP review peri
od were considered during preparation of the 
Draft EIR. Issues not related to the scope of the 
proposed project or not related to environmental 
effects (e.g., financing) are not addressed in the Draft EIR but may be considered by IRWD 

before making a final decision on the proposed project. Please refer to 
Appendix A for comments received during the scoping period and informati
on related to the circulation of the NOP.  

This Draft EIR contains a description of the proposed project, description of the baseline 
environmental setting, identification of project impacts, and mitigation measures for impacts 

found to be significant, as well as an analysis of 
project alternatives. The Draft EIR addresses the 
potential environmental effects of implementing the proposed project. 
Significance criteria have been developed for each

 Significant and Unavoidable:
 mitigation might be recommended but impacts are still 
significant.  Less than Significant with Mitigation:
 potentially significant impact but mitigated to a 
less-than-significant level;  Less than Significant:
 mitigation is not required under CEQA but may be 
recommended; or 
 No Impact. CEQA requires that a lead agency avoid, or 
substantially lessen significant impacts where 
feasible (CEQA Guidelines
 §15091 and §15092). If such a reduction is not possible, a lead 
agency must adopt Findings and a Statement 
of Overriding Considerations. As defined in 
CEQA Guidelines §15093, a Statement of Overriding Considerations balances the benefits of a project 
against its unavoidable environmental consequences. 
This document is being circulated to local, st

CEQA requires that the lead agency neither appr
ove nor implement a project unless the project™s 
significant environmental effects have been redu
ced to a less than significant level, essentially 
ﬁeliminating, avoiding, or subs
tantially lesseningﬂ the expected
 impacts. If the lead agency 
approves the project despite residual significant im
pacts that cannot be mitigated to a less than 
significant level, the agency must state the reas
ons for its action in writing. The Statement of 
Overriding Considerations must be included 
in the record of the project approval. State law requires lead agencies to adopt a mitigation monitoring and reporting program for those 
changes to the project that have been adopted or made a condition of project approval in order to 
mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment. The 
CEQA Guidelines do not require 
that the specific reporting or monitoring program be included in the EIR. Throughout this EIR, 

however, proposed mitigation measures have been
 clearly identified and presented in language 
that will facilitate establishment of a monitoring 
program. All adopted measures will be included 
in a mitigation monitoring and reporting program to verify compliance. 
1.4 Project Background 
IRWD was established in 1961 as a California Wa
ter District pursuant to the California Water District Law (California Water Code, Division 13
). IRWD provides potable and recycled water, 
sewage collection and treatment, and urban runoff treatment to municipal and industrial (M&I) 

and agricultural customers within an 115,531-acre 
service area in Orange County, California. The 
IRWD service area includes all of the City of Irvine and portions of Tustin, Newport Beach, 

Costa Mesa, Orange and Lake Forest. Currently, 75
 to 80 percent of the water IRWD provides for 
its customers comes from local sources, including
 groundwater (produced from the groundwater 
basin managed by Orange County Water District), surface water, and recycled water (from 

IRWD™s Michelson and Los Alisos Water Recyclin
g Plants). Less than 25 percent of IRWD™s 
water supply is imported by the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (Metropolitan or MWD) and purchased by IRWD through the M
unicipal Water District of Orange County 
(MWDOC). MWD imports water through both the State Water Project (SWP) and the Colorado 

River Aqueduct systems.  
In 2001, IRWD completed a consolidation with 
Los Alisos Water District (LAWD), which served 
portions of the City of Lake Forest. The existi
ng Baker Filtration Plant (BFP), located on Wisteria 
in Lake Forest, was one of the facilities owned 
and operated by LAWD that is now owned by 
IRWD. The BFP was operational from 1971 to 1
983, and was decommissioned when the Allen-
McColloch Pipeline was constructed. All BFP facilities are currently non-operational although 
remain onsite, including reservoirs, a filter plant,
 pump stations, and storage/office buildings 
(RBF/Carollo, 2010). IRWD has additional facilities in and around the BFP site that provide 
filtered water as a supplement to its recycled water system (IRWD, 2010).  
1. Introduction 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 1-7 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
For a number of years, water agencies in south Or
ange County have investigated alternatives for 
improving both water supply and water system 
reliability. South Orange County receives the 
majority of its potable water from MWDOC via Metropolitan™s Diemer Filtration Plant and the 

Allen-McColloch Pipeline (AMP). In December 1999, the AMP ruptured causing significant 

reduction in Metropolitan™s supplies to southern 
Orange County, demonstrating the dependence 
of this region on AMP operation. In 2007, a 
study was undertaken by the Santiago Aqueduct 
Commission (SAC) to determine the feasibility of
 constructing a new water treatment plant along the SAC-owned Baker Pipeline. The SAC is comprised of IRWD, ETWD, MNWD, SMWD, 
TCWD, and MWDOC.  The product water from such
 a facility would provide an additional 
supply of treated water to southern Orange C
ounty, creating redundant treatment and distribution 
capacity to the Diemer Filtration Plant and AM
P. The study recommended the Baker site as the 
location for such a facility to take advantage of already existing infrastructure.  
The proposed project includes or is in proximity 
to several regional water distribution facilities as 
described below and shown in 
Figure 1-2. These facilities would carry raw water to, or treated 
water from, the proposed Baker WTP. 
Santiago Lateral: 
The Santiago Lateral is an 8.7-mile l
ong pipeline that is owned by MWD and 
distributes raw water from the SWP and Colorado 
River systems. The Santiago Lateral delivers 
raw water to Irvine Lake or the Baker Pipelin
e from Lake Matthews via MWD™s Lower Feeder. 
The Santiago Lateral connects to the Baker Pipelin
e at the OC-33 turnout and connects to Irvine 
Lake at the OC-13 turnout.  
Baker Pipeline:
 The Baker Pipeline (formerly the Santia
go Aqueduct) is owned jointly by the 
SAC with several agencies having capacity rights, such as IRWD, County of Orange, East 

Orange Water District, SMWD, TCWD, and The 
Irvine Company. The Ba
ker Pipeline currently conveys untreated water received via the Santiago 
Lateral to agricultural interests in Orange County and to TCWD. The Baker Pipeline terminates
 at the Baker site and is currently operating at approximately 15 percent capacity. The propo
sed project would significantly increase its 
utilization. Irvine Lake and Pipeline: 
Irvine Lake, located at the base of the mountains in Cleveland 
National Forest, can store up to 28,000 acre feet
 (af) of water behind Santiago Dam with a surface 
area of approximately 700 acres. Irvine Lake is 
fed by Santiago Creek and also receives imported 
water via the Santiago Lateral. The lake captures 
approximately 7,000 af of local runoff per year 
(RBF/Carollo, 2010). IRWD is a partial owner of 
the lake together with Serrano Water District. 
Serrano Water District runs the lake™s concessions
 and recreational fishing and boating activities. 
Irvine Lake supplies water to IRWD and Serrano Water District through the Irvine Lake Pipeline. 
IRWD currently delivers untreated water from Irvin
e Lake to irrigation customers via the Irvine 
Lake Pipeline.  1. Introduction 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 1-8 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
Baker/Irvine Lake Pipeline Intertie:
 The Baker/Irvine Lake Pipeline Intertie enables the 
transfer of water from the Baker Pipeline to the 
Irvine Lake Pipeline and vice versa. The Intertie 
is owned and operated by 
IRWD and is located on land owned by the SAC.  
Allen-McColloch Pipeline (AMP):
 The AMP distributes treated water from MWD™s Diemer 
Filtration Plant to several water districts in s
outhern Orange County and terminates at El Toro 
Reservoir. The AMP bisects the Baker site, running parallel to the Baker Pipeline.  
South County Pump Station and Pipeline:
 The AMP extends from the Diemer Filtration Plant 
to El Toro Reservoir with connections at Pete
rs Canyon Pump Station, South County Pump 
Station and the Baker Filtration Plant. At the S
outh County Pump Station, water is diverted from 
the AMP to the South County Pipeline for distribution to MNWD, SMWD, and TCWD before 

terminating in Rancho Santa Margarita 
IRWD operates Irvine Lake to maximize water 
storage for use during the dry season. The water 
surface elevation (WSEL) at Irvine Lake typically ranges between 750 and 790 feet, as illustrated 

in Figure 1-3. Lake levels fluctuate seasonally with wa
ter supply availability, precipitation, and 
demands from customers. Typically, the lake is 
filled during the winter months by storm water 
runoff in the watershed and excess imported water 
delivered via the Santiago Lateral. The lake 
reaches its maximum storage capacity when the 
WSEL reaches 790 feet, which corresponds to a 
storage volume of approximately 28,000 af (
see Figure 1-3). The lake has been filled to maximum capacity in recent years, including 2005,
 2009, and 2010. The water stored in the lake 
is gradually depleted over summer and fall 
months, to accommodate dry season demands. As 
shown in Figure 1-3, minimum lake levels ty
pically do not drop below approximately 750 feet.

April 2011 
CHAPTER 2 2.0 Introduction IRWD is proposing to construct the Baker WTP Project (proposed project) to provide increased 
water supply reliability in southern Orange C
ounty by creating redundancy of treatment system 
capacity for potable water. The proposed Baker 
WTP would have a normal operating capacity of 
43.5 cfs (28 mgd) and would treat raw water fro
m variable supply sources. The proposed Baker 
WTP would provide redundant treatment capacity to MWD™s Diemer Treatment Plant on a 

regular basis and in the event of planned or
 unplanned outages of MWD facilities. The project 
would not increase the capacity of regional tr
eated water distribution pipelines, but rather 
improve regional potable water system reliability
 and operational flexibility. As described in 
Chapter 1, the Baker WTP would provide treated 
water to IRWD and four partner water agencies 
in southern Orange County: ETWD, MNWD, 
SMWD, and TCWD. In addition to the Baker WTP, the proposed project also would include 
a new offsite pump station near Peters Canyon 
Reservoir; a meter exchange and pipeline replace
ment at OC-33; a new sewer pipeline to convey 
non-reclaimable waste (NRW) from the Baker WTP to IRWD™s sanitary sewer system; and may 

include new pipelines to convey treated water from the Baker WTP to the South County Pipeline.  
2.1 Project Location The proposed Baker WTP would be constructed on 
the southernmost portion of a 98-acre parcel 
in the City of Lake Forest at the site of the 
existing BFP. The existing facilities at the Baker site 
are shown on Figure 2-1. Existing facilities include, but are not limited to, BFP facilities, such as 
the reservoirs, filter plant, and storage/office 
buildings, and other IRWD facilities such as pump 
stations and the antenna tower (RBF/Carollo, 2
010). The AMP and Baker Pipeline also currently 
bisect the site. The BFP facilities are currently non-operational.  
A new sewer pipeline would convey NRW from 
the Baker WTP to IRWD™s sanitary sewer 
system. The pipeline would be located within 
an existing 15-foot utility easement along the 
Serrano Creek Trail in the City of Lake Forest (
Figure 2-2). In addition, a new pipeline may be 
required to convey treated water from the Baker 
WTP to the South County Pipeline. The corridor 
for this potential pipeline would run from the 
Baker WTP through primarily open space lands 
adjacent to residential areas (Figure 2-2). Both 
pipeline alignments would 
be located within Non-
Reserve Lands in the Central Subarea of the 
Orange County Natural Community Conservation 
Plan (NCCP). Well #1

Final EIR 
April 2011 
The proposed Raw Water Pump Station would be lo
cated near Peters Canyon Reservoir in the City 
of Orange, at the site of the existing Baker/Irvine Lake Pipeline Intertie facilities (Figure 2-3). The proposed pump station would be located on land
 currently owned by the Santiago Aqueduct 
Commission (SAC), of which IRWD is a member.  
The proposed project requires a meter exchange 
and pipeline replacement at OC-33, which is 
located in an unincorporated area of the County of 
Orange in the hills east of Irvine Regional Park 
(Figure 2-4). OC-33 is located within an easement owned by MWD
. 2.2 Project Objectives The proposed Baker WTP is a regional project that is intended to: 
 Improve water reliability to areas of south Or
ange County by constructing local treatment 
capability for a variable supply source (imported water from MWD and local Irvine Lake 

water). 
 Provide a reliable, local potable water supply in the event of emergency conditions or 
scheduled maintenance of MWD™s delivery system. 
 Increase operational flexibility by creati
ng redundancy within the raw water supply 
system. 
2.3 Project Description 
Sources of raw water for the proposed project would include imported raw water supplied by 

MWD and water from Irvine Lake, which consists 
of imported water and local runoff. Raw water 
would be delivered to the Baker WTP via the ex
isting Baker Pipeline, which originates east of 
Irvine Regional Park and the City of Orange and 
terminates at the existing Baker site in the City 
of Lake Forest. Both raw water sources would be
 conveyed using existing pipeline facilities, 
including the MWD Lower Feeder, MWD Santiago 
Lateral, Baker Pipeline, and Irvine Lake 
Pipeline. Imported raw water would enter the Sa
ntiago Lateral from the Lower Feeder upstream 
of the Diemer Treatment Plant. Then, importe
d water would enter the Baker Pipeline from the 
Santiago Lateral at the OC-33 turnout (See Figure 
1-2 in Chapter 1). Raw water from Irvine Lake 
would be used when the lake is full during wet years and in the event of an outage of the Lower 

Feeder and Santiago Lateral. Raw water from Irv
ine Lake would be conveyed to the Baker WTP 
via the Irvine Lake Pipeline and the Baker Pipe
line. In order to convey flow through both 
pipelines, a new Raw Water Pump Station in the Ci
ty of Orange is planned to boost water from 
the Irvine Lake Pipeline into the Baker Pipeline. New Asphalt

Final EIR 
April 2011 
Irvine Lake is operated by IRWD and Serrano Wa
ter District. Operating water surface elevation 
(WSEL) at the lake ranges between 750 feet above
 mean sea level (amsl) and 790 feet amsl 
annually (See Figure 1-3 in Chapter 1). In additio
n to capturing natural runoff, Irvine Lake is 
filled with imported water that is conveyed to the lake via the Sa
ntiago Lateral at the OC-13 turn-
out. Typically, the lake is filled with imported 
water during the month of April after the rainy 
season has ended. The lake is drawn down durin
g the summer and fall. The proposed project 
would not significantly change the current operating scheme for Irvine Lake. The WSEL would 
continue to fluctuate between 750 and 790 feet am
sl. Raw water from Irvine Lake would continue 
to be used to serve existing agricultural customer
s in addition to intermittent or emergency use at 
the Baker WTP. The meter at OC-33 consists of a concrete 
vault, control panel and equipment for radio 
communication. For the proposed project, a new mete
r would be installed in the vault, along with 
reinstallation of a portion of pipeline upstream of
 the meter (Figure 2-4). The exchange of the 
meter will require work within the meter vault; 
replacement of the pipeline segment will require 
excavation and grading. Construction at OC-33 w
ould temporarily suspend raw water supplies to 
downstream agricultural users. Suspension of
 supplies would be coordinated with each 
agricultural user to prevent adverse effects to their operations. 

To deliver water from Irvine Lake to the Baker 
Pipeline, a new Raw Water Pump Station facility 
would be constructed in place of the existing Baker/Irvine Lake Pipeline Intertie near Peters Canyon Reservoir (Figure 2-3). The existing Intertie 
facility is a 600 square 
foot building (20 feet 
by 30 feet) that contains aboveground piping, a 
large diameter vault, and the intertie valve 
connecting the Baker Pipeline to the Irvine La
ke Pipeline. The existing building would be 
demolished and enlarged to house three new 
300-horsepower pumps, a control valve, and two 
pressure relief valves to convey water from the Irvin
e Lake Pipeline into the Baker Pipeline. The existing facilities that transfer water from the Bake
r Pipeline to the Irvine Lake Pipeline would be 
maintained during demolition and constructi
on with possible temporary shut downs.  
The proposed Raw Water Pump Station building wo
uld be designed with a similar appearance as 
the existing neighboring buildings onsite. The build
ing would have an approximate footprint of 
30 by 60 feet (1800 square feet) and a height of approximately 20 feet, similar to the height of the 

existing Intertie facility. In addition, a 12-foot 
diameter external surge tank would be installed 
outside next to the pump station within an area 
approximately 30 by 50 feet (1500 square feet). 
The surge tank would be two feet off the ground for a total height of 14 feet and width of 28 feet. 

An eight-foot high wall would be constructed to screen the view of the surge tank from 

surrounding streets.  
2. Project Description 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 2-8 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 

The proposed Baker WTP would utilize membrane filtr
ation, ultraviolet light for disinfection, and 
chloramination for secondary or residual disinfection (RBF/Carollo, 2010). The proposed WTP 

would include new facilities for raw water conveyanc
e, water treatment, treated water delivery, 
and NRW disposal. The quality of water produced
 at the Baker WTP would meet all existing 
rules and regulations applicable to the treatment 
of surface water in the State of California. The 
proposed layout for the WTP facilities is shown in
 Figure 2-5.
  The proposed project would require demolition of
 the existing Baker Filter Building, 3.4 MG 
reservoir, maintenance building, and Well #1 Reservoir (Figure 2-1). Both of the two 16-MG 

buried concrete reservoirs would remain in place 
and be used for storage of the treated product 
water.  
The following new facilities would be constructed at the proposed Baker WTP as shown in Figure 2-5 and 
Figure 2-6 and described further below.  
 Raw Water Conveyance Facilities:
 flow control facility, TCWD pump station, forebay, 
feed water strainers, feed water pump station; and about 1,000 feet of new 42-inch feed 

water pipeline.  Treatment Facilities:
 treatment building to house membrane filters and UV facilities, 
disinfection facility, backwash water treatment
 facilities, chemical storage building, 
standby generator, electrical equipment. 
 Treated Water Facilities: product water pump station, su
rge tanks, standby generator, 
electrical equipment, new 36-inch and 42-i
nch product water pipelines, meter vault. 
 Emergency Overflow Facilities: 
42-inch pipeline and discharge structure to convey 
overflow water from the forebay and di
sinfection facility to Serrano Creek. 
  Site Access Facilities:  
access during construction via Biscayne Bay Drive and existing 
access road; access during plant operation via 
Palmwood/Wisteria, Biscayne Bay Drive, 
and/or Indian Ocean Avenue; Wisteria 
gate relocation and new security fencing. The aboveground Baker WTP facilities would be 
designed to be compatible with existing 
buildings onsite at the BFP. The architectural 
theme would include concrete masonry unit (CMU) 
block walls, steel deck roofs, and aluminum 
frame doors and windows (RBF/Carollo, 2010). The 
building designs would attenuate the sound levels 
of mechanical equipment to be in compliance 
with City of Lake Forest noise ordinances at 
the Baker WTP property line. The proposed Baker 
WTP would require a computerized supervisory co
ntrol and data acquisition (SCADA) system to 
allow for remote control and monitoring of equipment, in addition to local control and 

monitoring. The Baker WTP SCADA system would be
 integrated into IRWD™s existing district-
wide SCADA system, which is used to co
mmunicate with IRWD facilities and ensure 
coordination and proper operation of IRWD f
acilities and systems throughout the service area. 
Operation of the Baker WTP SCADA system may require minor alterations to the existing 

antennae tower, which currently is part of IRWD™s existing district-wide SCADA system.

Raw Water Conveyance Facilities 
The Flow Control Facility (FCF) is the point of entry for raw water at the WTP. The FCF would 
be constructed as a buried vault with a roof slab
 surrounded by a retaining wall with a height of 
approximately eight feet. The FCF would control wa
ter delivery to the forebay. In addition, raw 
water strainers may be constructed to preven
t solids from depositing in the forebay. The raw 
water would pass through strainers just prior to the FCF. 
Currently TCWD receives raw water via the Ba
ker Pipeline. TCWD has a 16-inch pipeline connection to the Baker Pipeline onsite at the existing Baker site, which leads to TCWD™s Dimension Treatment Plant. To maintain deliver
ies of raw water to TCWD, in conjunction with 
delivery of raw water to the proposed Baker W
TP, a pump station is required. The TCWD pump 
station would be located onsite at the Baker 
WTP and would be constr
ucted aboveground, inside 
a block wall building. The pump station capacity 
of 6 cfs would be achieved with three 25-HP 
pumps (two duty, one standby). 
The forebay would be a partially-buried, cast-i
n-place concrete reservoir, with a height 
approximately one to two feet above grade. Th
e forebay would provide flow equalization for 
water entering the WTP. The feed water pump st
ation would feed raw water from the forebay to 
the strainers prior to reaching the membrane filtration system. The feed water pump station would 

be enclosed in a 30-foot high building on top of
 the forebay, and would contain the feedwater 
strainers and a total of six 300-HP pumps (five 
duty, one standby) each with a capacity of 
approximately 4,900 gallo
ns per minute (gpm).  
Treatment Facilities The treatment building would house the treatment 
facilities, including the membrane filtration 
system (MFS), UV disinfection system, and the control room. The treatment building would be a 

single-story building with a footprint of approximately 100 feet by 200 feet (20,000 sf) and an 

approximate height of 35 feet. After passi
ng through the MFS and UV system, treated water 
would be conveyed to the disinfection facility. The disinfection facility would consist of a 

partially-buried concrete chlorine contact basin, 
with a height approximately six to nine inches 
above grade. After passing through the chlorine 
contact basin, treated water would be conveyed 
to the existing 16-MG reservoirs for storage and distribution. The chemical storage building would be a single-story building with a footprint of approximately 
75 feet by 150 feet (11,250 sf) and an approxima
te height of 33 feet. The building would contain 
chemical storage tanks, pumps, and chemical containment areas and would have an HVAC 

system and fire suppression system.  
The backwash water treatment system would process residual water from the MFS and the 
strainers, recycling water back to the foreba
y and conveying NRW to the sanitary sewer. The 
backwash system would consist of a concrete 
tank at grade with a water equalization basin 
containing submersible pumps, a flocculation basin, and sediment basin.

Final EIR 
April 2011 
Treated Water Facilities The product water pump station (PWPS) would pump treated water from the storage reservoirs to 
the AMP or SCP for delivery to the partner water agencies. IRWD would receive treated water 

from the storage reservoirs by gravity, into th
e Lake Forest Zone 1 system. The PWPS would 
have a capacity of 33 cfs and would consist of 
five pumps (four duty, one standby). Each pump 
would have a capacity of 3,700 gpm and be dr
iven by 300ŒHP motors. The PWPS would be an 
enclosed concrete block masonry building, with a 
footprint of approximately 50 feet by 60 feet 
(3,000 sf) and a height of 25 feet. 
 Emergency Overflow 
There are two free-surface basins planned at the 
Baker site: the forebay and chlorine contact 
basin. Each of these facilities would be constructe
d as a concrete tank with an overflow. Under 
possible, yet infrequent conditions, the Baker W
TP may require discharge of raw water from the 
forebay, or filtered water from the chlorine c
ontact basin, up to 54 cfs. To handle the flow, a 
42-inch diameter reinforced concrete pipeline w
ould be constructed to en
able water overflows to be conveyed to Serrano Creek east of the Baker site (Figure 2-5). The discharge structure would 

be approximately 10 feet by 13.5 feet and woul
d include approximately 42 feet of rip-rap to 
dissipate flow and prevent erosion, siltation, and sedimentation in the creek.  
Serrano Creek is part of the San Diego Creek/Pet
ers Canyon Wash subwatershed, which is the 
largest subwatershed in the Newport Bay waters
hed and collectively drains into the northeastern 
end of Upper Newport Bay.  Therefore, Serrano 
Creek is considered a Traditionally Navigable 
Water, is considered ﬁwaters of the U.S.,ﬂ and 
is subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers (USACE), as well as within th
e jurisdiction of the California Department of 
Fish and Game (CDFG). Construction of the disch
arge structure within the creek may require 
permits from CDFG, USACE, and the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB).   
Site Access Facilities During project construction, all construc
tion vehicles would access the Baker site via 
Commercentre Drive, Biscayne Bay Drive, and th
e existing paved access road north of the Baker 
site (See Figure 2-6). During project operation, delivery vehicles and staff vehicles would access 
the Baker site either via Commercentre Drive/Biscayne Bay Drive or via Palmwood and Wisteria 
(see Figure 2-6). The front gate near Wisteria w
ould be relocated as shown in Figure 2-6 to 
ensure safe passage for vehicles 
accessing the site from both entry points and protect public 
safety.  
Planned future development on the vacant land north
 of the Baker site w
ould include construction of new roadways. When and if such development 
is completed, instead of Biscayne Bay Drive, 
vehicles would access the Baker site via Commercentre Drive, Indian Ocean Drive, and a new 

access road as shown in Figure 2-6.    
2. Project Description 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 2-13 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
Approximately 0.6 mgd of NRW would be gene
rated at the proposed Baker WTP and conveyed 
to the IRWD sanitary sewer system. A new sewer 
connection at the southeastern corner of the 
Baker site would be necessary, as well as a new sewer pipeline. Approximately 2,500 linear feet 

of new 15-inch sewer pipeline would be installe
d along the Serrano Creek Trail in the City of 
Lake Forest to connect to an existing 15-in
ch sewer pipeline with adequate capacity. The 
proposed sewer pipeline alignment would be locat
ed within an existing 15-foot utility easement 
owned by IRWD (Figure 2-2). NRW would be conv
eyed to IRWD™s Los Alisos Water Recycling 
Plant for treatment. Treated water from the Baker WTP would flow 
by gravity to IRWD customers through its 
existing distribution system. The Baker WTP prod
uct water pump station (described above in 
Section 2.1.3) would be required to convey treat
ed water to the partner agencies. The preferred 
method of delivering water to the partner ag
encies would be through an existing onsite 
connection to the AMP. The AMP currently bisects 
the proposed project site within an existing 
pipeline easement. IRWD is currently coordinating 
with Metropolitan for use of the AMP. If the 
AMP alternative is unable to be implemented,
 then IRWD would construct a new pipeline 
connecting the Baker WTP to the SCP. IRWD is 
considering two pipeline alignments to connect to the SCP, shown as Option 1 and Option 2 in Figure 2-2.  
2.4 Project Construction 
Construction of the Raw Water Pump Station 
would involve demolition and site clearing, 
excavation for new pipeline connections and stru
ctural foundation installation, grading for 
building pad, pump house construction, pump installa
tion, surge tank installation, and final site 
restoration. The pump station exteriors would be
 built in accordance with standard construction methods for roofed masonry buildings. After th
e pump house is built and the pumps installed, 
electrical equipment (e.g. machinery control c
onsoles, switchboards, lighting, etc.) would be 
installed.  The following construction equipment is expected 
to be present onsite: a dozer, a haul truck, and 
a front end loader. There would be approximat
ely 20 workers onsite per day. Approximately 
500 cubic yards (cy) of demolition debris would be
 hauled offsite for disposal; approximately 
1,000 cy of material would be excavated at the 
site; and approximately 500 
cy of concrete would 
be imported. Hauling and delivery of material w
ould require approximately 100 truck trips. The 
construction footprint, including staging areas, would be one acre in size. The duration of construction would be approximately one year, be
ginning in the summer of 2011 (dates subject to 
2. Project Description 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant

Final EIR 
April 2011 
change). The pump station would be constructed 
within the SAC-owned parcel but construction 
easements would be required from the County of Orange and MWDOC. 
Construction of the proposed Baker WTP would in
clude demolition of old facilities, site clearing, 
excavation, grading, treatment plant construction,
 paving and site restoration. The operation of 
existing facilities at the BFP would be disconti
nued. The following existing facilities would be 
demolished: Baker Filter Building, 3.4 MG 
reservoir, maintenance building, and Well #1 
Reservoir (Figure 2-1). Existing underground pipe
lines would remain in place, unless they would 
interfere with grading or new pipeline installati
on. The existing perimeter fencing around the site 
would be reviewed and damaged portions would be replaced to ensure the site is secure. The location of the access gate on the west end of th
e Baker Site would be relocated approximately 
100 feet as shown in Figure 2-6. 
The following construction equipment is expect
ed to be present onsite for the duration of construction: a dozer, a front end loader, a scrap
er, and three haul/dump trucks. There would be 
approximately 60 workers onsite per day. Approx
imately 10,000 cy of demolition debris would 
be hauled offsite for disposal; approximately 12,0
00 cy of material would be excavated from the 
site; and approximately 6,500 cy of
 concrete would be imported. Ha
uling and delivery of material 
would require approximately 500 truck trips. A pe
rmit would be required from the City of Lake 
Forest to ensure that the conditions of the streets used for hauling are not inordinately impacted. 
Construction vehicles would access the site using Commercentre Drive to Biscayne Bay Drive to 

the existing paved access road. The construction foot
print, including staging areas, would be eight acres in size. A 300,000 square foot area of the footprint would be graded. Grading for the 

proposed project is based on grading down th
e existing slope behind the filter building for construction of the forebay, feedwater pump sta
tion and backwash wastewater treatment facilities 
(RBF/Carollo, 2010).The duration of construc
tion would be approximately 18 to 24 months 
beginning in summer 2011.  
Construction of the proposed pipelines would occur through trench installation. The sewer 

pipeline would be installed within an existi
ng 15-foot-wide utility easement that runs along 
Serrano Creek Trail. An additional 15-foot-wide temporary constr
uction easement adjacent to and north of the utility easement may also be utilized
. If necessary to construct to connect the Baker 
WTP to the SCP, the treated water pipeline woul
d be installed through approximately 1100 feet 
of undeveloped land. The pipeline replacement at
 OC-33 would occur within an existing utility 
easement owned by MWD.  
Trenching would utilize a conventional cut a
nd cover construction technique. The trenching 
technique would include trench excavation, pipe 
installation, backfill operations, and re-surfacing 
to the original condition. The trench is typically 
six feet deep with a maximum depth of 10 to 12 
feet. At a depth of 10 feet the maximum width of the trench would be approximately 18 feet. On 
2. Project Description 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 2-15 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
average, 50 to 100 feet of pipeline may be installed per day. 
Trenches would be temporarily closed at the end of
 each work day, by covering them with steel 
trench plates and installing barricades to restrict access to staging areas. The construction equipment needed would include a backhoe, a front end loader, and a haul truck.  
For the sewer pipeline, approximately 200 cy of 
soil would be excavated and hauled offsite. The 
staging area would be located along Serrano Creek 
Trail and would be approximately 30 feet by 
50 feet. The duration of construction would be 
approximately six months
. During construction, 
trail detours would be established to enable conti
nued use of the trail by the public to the extent 
feasible. 
For the treated water pipeline, approximately 3
50 cy of soil would be excavated and hauled 
offsite. The staging area would be approximately 10
0 feet wide and 100 feet long. The duration of 
construction would be ap
proximately six months. 
For the OC-33 pipeline replacement, approximately 100 cy of soil would be excavated and 
temporarily stockpiled onsite. Excavated soil w
ould be used for backfill once the pipeline is 
installed and remaining soil would be bala
nced onsite. Equipment staging would be 
accommodated onsite within previously disturbed areas
. 2.5 Project Operation and Maintenance The Baker WTP would have an operating capacity 
of up to 43.5 cfs. The WTP would regularly 
treat imported water conveyed through the Bake
r Pipeline via the Santiago Lateral. Imported 
water deliveries would be scheduled with Metropo
litan. During outages of the Santiago Lateral or 
Lower Feeder, the Baker WTP would be able to 
treat water from Irvine Lake. In addition, the 
proposed Baker WTP would treat raw water from 
Irvine Lake intermittently during the year, 
depending on annual precipitation and Irvine Lake water levels. The WSEL at Irvine Lake typically ranges between 750 and 790 feet (Figure 
1-3). As previously described, the proposed 
project would not significantly change the cu
rrent operating scheme for Irvine Lake. The WSEL 
would continue to fluctuate between 750 and 790 
feet amsl. Raw water from Irvine Lake would 
continue to be used to serve existing agricu
ltural customers in addition to intermittent or emergency use at the Baker WTP.  
The Baker WTP would require monthly maintena
nce trips and the Raw Water Pump Station 
would require semi-annual maintenance trips. 
The Baker WTP would be staffed daily by a 
maximum of three onsite workers. The Raw Wa
ter Pump Station would not be staffed but 
remotely monitored via SCADA. 
Operation of the proposed Baker WTP would invol
ve onsite chemical use and storage. Chemicals 
would be stored in the proposed dedicated chemi
cal storage building. An inventory of chemicals 
2. Project Description

that would be stored and used at the Baker WTP is provided in 
Table 2-1 below. Each chemical 
would be stored in aboveground 
tanks in a dedicated containment area with secondary containment 
areas to confine accidental spills and prevent expos
ure to the environment. The containment areas 
would be sized to accommodate storage tank volumes
 and sprinkler system operations to prevent 
accidental spills. Delivery frequency for 
each chemical is listed in Table 2-1.

  Operation of the proposed project would result in
 an increase in energy consumption, requiring 
approximately 24.5 million kilowatt hours (kWH
) per year to run the Baker WTP (assuming 
operation for 50 weeks per year) and approximately
 1.7 million kWH to run the Raw Water Pump 
Station (assuming operation for 3 months per year).

3.1 Aesthetics This chapter addresses the potential impacts of 
the proposed project to aesthetics and visual 
quality in the project vicinity. It includes a d
escription of the environmental setting to establish 
baseline conditions for aesthetic resources, a su
mmary of the regulations related to aesthetic 
resources, and an evaluation of the project™s poten
tial effects on scenic vistas, visual character, 
and light and glare.  

Regional Setting The cities of Lake Forest and Orange are located in Orange County, about halfway between 
Los Angeles and San Diego, on the east side of Interstate 5. Cities surrounding Lake Forest 
include Mission Viejo to the southeast, Irvine to the northwest, and Laguna Hills to the 

southwest. The incorporated communities of Aliso Viejo and Rancho Santa Margarita are located near the City to the south and southeast, and the 
Cleveland National Forest lies directly north of 
the City. Cities surrounding Orange include Anaheim 
to the west, Santa Ana to the south, Tustin 
to the southeast, and unincorporated land to the east. 
The City of Lake Forest contains a population 
of approximately 76,323 and an area encompassing 
16.6 square miles (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010; Ci
ty of Lake Forest, 2006). Located in south 
Orange County between the coastal floodplain and the Santa Ana Mountains, the City is 

characterized as being a series of planned comm
unities among natural and created features such 
as rolling hills, lakes, creeks and eucalyptus grov
es. The western portion of the City is near sea 
level, while the northeastern portion reaches elevations of up to 1,500 feet. The Santa Ana 

Mountains and foothills can be seen from vari
ous points within the City, including major 
roadways, while views of the Saddleback Valley 
floor and the Pacific Ocean can be seen from 
higher elevations. The Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park is a prominent visual feature in the 
northern portion of the City, located generally 
uphill and above Foothill Ranch and Portola Hills. 
Aliso Creek, Serrano Creek, and two smaller creek
s traverse the city. Significant portions of 
Aliso Creek and Serrano Creek include trails 
and open space and have a natural / undeveloped character. The City also has two manmade la
kes, which are located within residential 
developments (City of Lake Forest, 2006). Promin
ent natural features within the City of Lake Forest include groves of eucalyptus trees, public
 parks, natural open spaces, created lakes and panoramic mountain views (City of Lake Forest, 2006). 
The City of Orange contains a population of 
approximately 3,026,786 and an area encompassing 
37.19 square miles (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010; Ci
ty of Orange, 2009a). The topography of the 
City provides ample opportunity for views of 
the rolling hills, tree-lined suburbs, and water 
features at various intervals. Portions of Orange are characterized by scenic vistas including 

undeveloped hillsides, ridgelines, and open space area
s that provide a unifying visual backdrop to 
the urban environment. These viewsheds contribut
e to the City™s identity and an abundance of 
scenic vistas occur in the largely undeveloped Sa
ntiago Hills II and East Orange portions of the planning area including Irvine Lake, grassy va
lleys, rugged hillsides, and winding canyons (City

of Orange, 2009b). Prominent natural features with
in the City of Orange include natural open 
spaces, rivers, riparian areas, rock outcroppings, 
naturally vegetated hillsides, and public parks. 
Major roadway corridors in the project vicinity include Interstate 5, State Route 261, and State 
Route 241. The three roadways provide both re
gional connectivity throughout Orange County 
and interregional connectivity throughout the State.  Project Area The proposed Baker WTP would be located on the southernmost portion of a 98-acre parcel in the 
City of Lake Forest at the site of the existing 
BFP. The northern 82 acres of the parcel is largely 
vacant land and is planned for the development of
 a residential property called Serrano Summit 
(608 units) and a civic center site in accordance with the City of Lake Forest Opportunities Study. 

Surrounding land uses primarily consist of low de
nsity residential, public facility, community 
park/open space, and light industrial. Existing natu
ral features in the vicinity of the Baker site 
include Serrano Creek and Serrano Creek Trail. The 
City of Lake Forest has not designated any 
scenic roadways or scenic vistas/viewpoint
s in the area surrounding the Baker WTP. Figure 3.1-1
 shows existing visual character of the Baker site.  
The corridor for the potential treated water 
pipeline would run from the Baker WTP through 
primarily open space lands adjacent to and visible from residential areas. 
Figure 3.1-2 shows existing visual character of the treated water pi
peline corridors. In addition, a new sewer pipeline 
would be constructed along the Serrano Creek trail. 
The Serrano Creek trail is located adjacent to and visible from residential areas. 
The proposed Raw Water Pump Station would be
 within Peters Canyon Regional Park, a 354-
acre County regional park in the City of Or
ange. The Raw Water Pump Station would be 
constructed in place of the existing Baker/Irvine Lake Pipeline Intertie. Figure 3.1-3 shows existing visual character of the Intertie facility
. The Intertie facility is surrounded by open space 
characterized by coastal sage scrub and is accessibl
e from Jamboree Road. In the vicinity of the 
proposed Raw Water Pump Station, several City
 of Orange roadways have scenic qualities and 
are designated as viewscape corridors by the Count
y of Orange. Viewscape corridors are defined 
as routes that traverse a corridor within which 
unique or unusual scenic resources and aesthetic 
values are found. Viewscape corridors include portions of Jamboree Road, Santiago Canyon 

Road, and Newport Boulevard (City of Orange, 2009
). The Intertie facility is screened from view 
from Jamboree Road by fencing and vegetation. 
The Intertie facility is distantly visible from 
Santiago Canyon Road and also screened from view 
by vegetation. The Intertie facility is not 
visible from Newport Boulevard.  
The OC-33 site is located in the hills north of Irvine Regional Park within MWD™s easement, and 
is already cleared and devoid of vegetation (see Figure 2-4 in the Project Description). The OC-

33 site is characterized by partially-buried vau
lts and some aboveground piping and valves. The 
OC-33 site is in close proximity to the portion 
of Jamboree Road that is a designated viewscape 
corridor by the County of Orange. The OC-33 
Meter Exchange component of the proposed 
project would not introduce any new aboveground structures. Existing visual character is shown

The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) administers the State Scenic Highways 
Program to preserve and protect scenic highway corridors from projects that would diminish the 

aesthetic value of lands adjacent to highways (Sections 260 
et seq. of the California Streets and 
Highways Code). Scenic highway corridors are 
defined as the land generally adjacent to and 
visible by motorists from a scenic highway. The St
ate Scenic Highway System includes a list of 
highways that are either eligible for designation 
as scenic highways or have been so designated. These highways are identified in Section 263 of the Streets and Highways Code. No highways in

County of Orange  
General Plan  The County of Orange General Plan addresses ae
sthetics and visual resources in the Resources 
Element and Transportation Element. No specific goa
ls or policies that pertain to the scenic or visual resources were identified in the County Gene
ral Plan that would apply to the OC-33 Meter 
Exchange. Significance Criteria 
The criteria used to determine the significance of
 impacts related to aesthetic resources are based 
on Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines. The proposed project would result in a significant 
impact if it would: 
 Create a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista;  
 Substantially damage scenic resources, 
including but not limited to, trees, rock 
outcroppings, and historic buildings within a state scenic highway; 
 Substantially degrade the existing visual 
character or quality of the site and its 
surroundings; or 
 Create a new source of substantial light or glare which would adversely affect day or 
nighttime views in the area. 
The significance determination is based on several 
evaluation criteria, including the extent of project visibility from sensitive viewing areas such
 as designated state routes, public open space, 
or residential areas; the degree to which the various
 project elements would 
contrast with or be integrated into the existing landscape; the extent of change in the landscape™s composition and 
character; and the number and sensitivity of viewers. 
Impacts Discussion 
The following sections discuss the potential effects of the proposed project to aesthetic resources 
according to the key issue areas identified in Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines
 and corresponding to the significance criteria identified above.

Scenic Highway Corridors 
The City of Lake Forest and the City of Or
ange do not contain any state-designated scenic 
highways within their jurisdictional limits, as designated by the California Department of 

Transportation (Caltrans) under the California Scenic Highway Program (Caltrans, 2010). 
Accordingly, neither the City of Lake Forest nor
 the City of Orange have any associated state 
scenic highway corridors, which are defined as th
e land generally adjacent to and visible by 
motorists from a scenic highway. Therefore, construction and operation of the proposed project 

would have no impact to scenic resource
s within a state scenic highway corridor.  
Scenic Vistas 
Impact 3.1-1: Implementation of the proposed project could impact scenic vistas. (Less than 
Significant with Mitigation) 
A scenic vista is defined as an expansive view 
of a highly valued landscape from a particular 
public viewpoint. The proposed Baker WTP woul
d result in the construction of new treatment 
facilities at the Baker site in the City of Lake Forest. The proposed facilities as well as 

construction equipment would be visible from surr
ounding streets, including hilltop residential 
units located east of the Baker site. There are no 
City-designated scenic vistas in the vicinity of 
the Baker site (City of Lake Forest, 1994). 
The proposed Baker WTP would replace existing 
water treatment facilities within the same genera
l footprint of the existing BFP and would not 
introduce a new contrasting feature that would 
affect scenic vistas. The aboveground Baker WTP 
facilities would be designed to be compatible w
ith existing buildings onsite, such as the office 
and storage buildings. Implementation of Mitiga
tion Measure AES-1 would ensure that project 
facilities would continue to be screened from vi
ews from neighboring streets and that landscape 
vegetation is maintained onsite to the extent feasible to screen project facilities from scenic views 
from hilltop residences. The proposed treated water pipeline and sewer pipeline would be below 

ground and would not impact a scenic vista.  
The proposed Raw Water Pump Station would be loca
ted onsite at the existing Intertie facility in 
the City of Orange. This site is located w
ithin Peters Canyon Regional Park. The proposed pump 
station may be visible from Santiago Canyon
 Road, which is a City-designated viewscape 
corridor (City of Orange, 2009a). However, the 
pump station would be c
onstructed on previously 
developed land and within the 
property boundaries of existing water utility facilities. The pump 
station building would be approximately 20 feet above the ground surface, similar in height to 
existing facilities currently onsite at the Intertie 
facility. As a result, the proposed pump station 
would not substantially alter the viewscape corridor from Santiago Canyon Road. The pump 

station also would be visible from Jamboree 
Road. Jamboree Road is a City-designated 
viewscape corridor north of Santiago Canyon Road
. However, the proposed pump station would 
be located on Jamboree Road south of Santiago 
Canyon Road. The proposed pump station would 
not have a substantial adverse effect on scenic 
vistas. Impacts would be less than significant. 
The proposed OC-33 Meter Exchange is located in the open space hills of Irvine Regional Park 
and could be visible within a scenic vista from pub
lic vantage points. The OC-33 site is in close 
proximity to the portion of Jamboree Road that
 is designated as a viewscape corridor by the

County of Orange. However, the meter exchange
 and pipeline replacement would not introduce 
any new aboveground components at the site and 
would not disturb any existing vegetation. The 
OC-33 Meter Exchange would have no permanent impacts to scenic vistas. 
Mitigation Measures 
AES-1: IRWD shall prepare a landscape plan during project design that includes 
specifications for perimeter vegetation to scr
een the Baker WTP from neighboring streets. 
The landscape plan also shall include specifications to maintain or replace vegetation onsite 
to the extent feasible.  
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.   Visual Character 
Impact 3.1-2: Implementation of the proposed project could impact the visual character of 
project sites and surroundings. (Less than Significant with Mitigation) 
The Baker site is directly adjacent to residen
tial communities to the south and east. The existing 
visual character of the Baker site is defined by 
the existing treatment facilities associated with the 
BFP. The proposed Baker WTP would replace existing treatment facilities and would be 
constructed largely within the boundaries of the 
existing BFP. Installation of water treatment 
facilities at the Baker site would not alter the visual character of the site. In addition, the 

aboveground Baker WTP facilities would be simila
r in height to existing BFP buildings and 
designed to be compatible with the existing office 
and storage buildings that would remain onsite.  
The proposed treated water pipeline and sewer pipe
line would be constructed in open space areas 
adjacent to residential land uses. Pipeline construction would impact the visual character of the 
project corridor during construction. Howeve
r, once constructed the pipelines would be 
belowground and would not alter the visual character of the sites or their surroundings. 

Implementation of Mitigation Measu
re AES-2 would ensure that pipeline construction would not 
substantially degrade the visual character of
 the sites by requiring post-construction site 
restoration. Impacts would be less than significant with mitigation.  
The proposed Raw Water Pump Station would be 
constructed onsite at the existing Intertie facility, which is within Peters Canyon Regiona
l Park and visible from surrounding recreational 
land uses. Construction of the Pump Station would result in visual impacts for the duration of 

construction. Once constructed, however, the Pump
 Station building, surge tank, and wall would 
be no more than 20 feet above the ground surface, 
similar in height to existing facilities currently 
onsite at the Intertie facility. The proposed pump 
station would be consistent with existing land 
use at the site. As a result, implementation of
 the proposed project would not substantially 
degrade the visual character of the site
. Impacts would be less than significant. 
The proposed OC-33 Meter Exchange would not 
introduce any new aboveground components at 
the site and would not disturb any existing vegeta
tion. Construction activities associated with the 
3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

April 2011 
pipeline replacement would have minimal visual 
impacts for the duration of construction due to 
the presence of construction equipment onsite. Howe
ver, the OC-33 Meter Exchange would have no impact to the permanent visual character of the site. 
Mitigation Measure 
AES-2: IRWD shall restore areas disturbed during construction of the treated water 
pipeline and sewer pipeline by reestablishing 
pre-existing conditions including topography, repaving roadways, replanting trees, and/or reseed
ing or restoring with native plants typical 
of the immediate surrounding area. IRWD shall 
be responsible for monitoring the replanted 
areas for up to three years, or less if the revegetation is determined to be successful and 
sufficient to avoid excessive erosion.  Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.   Light and Glare 
Impact 3.1-3: Implementation of the proposed project would create a new source of light or 
glare that could adversely affect day or nighttime views in the area. (Less than Significant 
with Mitigation) Construction of the proposed Baker WTP faciliti
es and pipelines would be limited to the hours of 
7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. in accordance with the Ci
ty of Lake Forest Noise Ordinances (11.16.040 
Exterior Noise Standards; 11.16.060 Exemptions
) (City of Lake Forest, 1994), or as otherwise 
permitted by the City of Lake Forest. Construc
tion of the proposed Raw Water Pump Station 
would be limited to the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:
00 p.m. in accordance with the City of Orange 
Noise Ordinance (8.24.050 Exterior Noise Sta
ndards; 8.24.070 Exemptions) (City of Orange, 
2008), or as otherwise permitted by the City of 
Orange. Construction of the proposed OC-33 
Meter Exchange would be limited to the hours of 
7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. in accordance with the 
County of Orange Noise Ordinance (4-6-5 Exteri
or Noise Standards; 4-6-7 Special Provisions). 
Implementation of Mitigation Measure NOISE-1 
would limit construction to daytime hours and 
would avoid impacts to nighttime views due to li
ghting associated with nighttime construction. 
(See Section 3.10 Noise for Mitigation Measure NOISE-1.)  
A few pipeline tie-ins, such as the sewer and AMP 
pipeline connections, would have to occur at 
nighttime during periods of low flow in the pipeline system. These activities would be of a short 

duration (one night). Any impacts to nighttime vi
ews due to lighting associated with these tie-ins 
would be considered less than significant. 
 Permanent nighttime security lighting would be 
installed at the proposed Baker WTP and Raw Water Pump Station. Implementation of Mitiga
tion Measure AES-3 would ensure that security 
lighting would not affect neighboring land uses by 
requiring all lighting to be directed downward 
and out of the line of sight of ne
ighboring land uses, and to be turn
ed off automatically at night to 
the extent feasible. Impacts due to light and glar
e would be less than significant with mitigation.

3.2  Agricultural and Forestry Resources 
This section describes the environmental setti
ng for agricultural and forestry resources, 
summarizes the applicable regulatory framework
, and identifies impacts to agricultural and 
forestry resources that could occur as a result 
of implementation of the proposed project. 

Regional Setting Historically, Orange County and the City of Lake 
Forest and the City of Orange were used for 
agriculture. The total acreages 
of agricultural land in the cities have declined over time as 
development has occurred.  
The City of Lake Forest is characterized by 
a series of planned communities among natural and 
created features such as rolling hills, lakes, cr
eeks and eucalyptus groves. The name is derived 
from the lakes created as part of housing developm
ents built in the early 1970s and the eucalyptus 
forests that were cultivated during the 1900s (City of Lake Forest, 1994). Citrus production 
during the 1920s cultivated and shaped the appearance of the landscape, which was made 
possible due to drilling technology that obtained greater amounts of irrigation water from local 

wells. However, due to limited groundwater supp
lies and limited imported water infrastructure, 
the area did not substantially grow until the 197
0s when imported water supplies were extended 
into the area (City of Lake Forest, 1994). Citrus
 groves were eventually replaced with single-
family homes, commerce centers and parks that tu
rned the once agricultural-based region into a 
modern suburban landscape. 
The City of Lake Forest includes a large grove of
 eucalyptus trees in the south central portion of 
the City. Approximately 400 acres of eucalyptus ﬁf
orestﬂ were planted in the early 1900s for the 
purpose of using the wood as a major source of lumber. However, due to the eucalyptus wood 

being susceptible to cracks that compromised th
e strength and quality, the economic endeavors 
were abandoned and leaving the extensive eucalyp
tus forest preserved and recognized as a focal 
point for the community.  
The City of Orange experienced large amounts of
 agricultural development during the late 1880s 
through the 1950s. Citrus and other agricultural 
industries were the predominant influences for 
the City and were made possible with the deve
lopment of local wells and the introduction of 
reliable irrigation and transportation systems in 
the early 1880™s. Housing development began to 
flourish during the 1920s and grew significantly during the post-World War II years. By the 

1950s, ranchers sold their acreage and orange gr
oves declined to make way for the City™s 
suburban residential growth. 
A portion of the City of Orange™s sphere of in
fluence includes the Cleveland National Forest. The greatest concentration of open space within the 
City of Orange™s planning area is within the 
Cleveland National Forest, which includes several
 hundred acres in the Peralta Hills area and 3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures 
3.2 Agricultural and Forestry Resources 
IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant

April 2011 
several hundred acres in the hills south and east of
 Orange Park Acres, consisting of Santiago Oaks Regional Park, Irvine Regional Park, and 
Peters Canyon Regional Pa
rk (City of Orange, 2009). OC-33 is located within Irvine Regional Park. 
Interspersed within the City itself is urban 
forestland. Project Area The project sites are not characterized by existing 
agricultural production, forests, or timberland. 
The Baker site is currently developed with wate
r treatment facilities. The proposed treated water 
pipelines would run through existing open sp
ace characterized by coastal sage scrub and 
landscaped vegetation. The proposed sewer pipeline would run through an existing utility 
easement along Serrano Creek Trail adjacent to
 Serrano Creek. The proposed Raw Water Pump 
Station would be located at the existing Intertie
 facility within Peters Canyon Regional Park, 
which is currently developed with water utility facilities. The proposed OC-33 Meter Exchange 
would be located at the existing OC-33 site, which 
is located just outside of Irvine Regional Park in unincorporated Orange County. 
The City of Lake Forest™s zoning designation for 
the Baker site is General Agriculture (A1). The 
proposed Baker WTP and a portion of the proposed treated water pipeline would be located at the 

Baker site. Per Section 9.10.030 of the Lake For
est Zoning Code, public/private utility buildings 
and structures are permitted in an A1 zone subj
ect to a site development permit. The zoning 
designations for the remaining project components are not associated with agricultural or forestry 

resources (see Section 3.9, Land 
Use, Planning and Recreation). 
State California Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program 
The California Department of Conservation (CDC), under the Division of Land Resource 
Protection, has established the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP). The FMMP 

monitors the conversion of the state™s farmland 
to and from agricultural
 use. The map series identifies eight classifications and uses a minimum mapping unit size of 10 acres. The FMMP 

also produces a biannual report on the amount of land converted from agricultural to non-

agricultural use. The FMMP maintains an invent
ory of state agricultural land and updates its 
ﬁImportant Farmland Series Mapsﬂ every two 
years (CDC, 2007a). Important farmlands are 
divided into the following five categories 
based on their suitability for agriculture: 
Prime Farmland. 
Prime Farmland is land with the best combination of physical and 
chemical characteristics able 
to sustain long-term production of agricultural crops. This 
land has produced irrigated crops at some time
 within the four years prior to the mapping 
date. Farmland of Statewide Importance.
 Farmland of Statewide Importance is land that meets 
the criteria for Prime Farmland but with minor shortcomings such as greater slopes or 
lesser soil moisture capacity.

April 2011 
Unique Farmland. Unique Farmland has even lesser 
quality soils and produces the state™s 
leading agricultural crops. This land is usua
lly irrigated but also includes non-irrigated 
orchards and vineyards. 
Farmland of Local Importance. Farmland of Local Importance is
 land that is important to 
the local agricultural economy as determined by each county's board of supervisors and a 

local advisory committee. 
Grazing Land. 
Grazing Land is land on which the exis
ting vegetation is suited to the 
grazing of livestock. 
None of the project sites are designate
d as important farmland under the FMMP.  
Williamson Act The California Land Conservation Act of 1965, also known as the Williamson Act, is designed to 
preserve agricultural and open space lands by discouraging their premature and unnecessary 

conversion to urban uses. Williamson Act contracts,
 also known as agricultural preserves, create 
an arrangement whereby private landowners cont
ract with counties and cities to voluntarily 
restrict their land to agricultural and co
mpatible open-space uses. The vehicle for these 
agreements is a rolling term 10-year contract.
1 In return, restricted parcels are assessed for tax 
purposes at a rate consistent with their actual use, 
rather than potential market value. To cancel a 
Williamson Act contract, either the local gove
rnment or the landowner can initiate the 
nonrenewal process. A "notice of nonrenewal" starts a 9-year nonrenewal period. During the 

nonrenewal process, the annual tax assessment gra
dually increases. At the end of the 9-year 
nonrenewal period, the contract is terminated. 
Contracts renew automatically every year unless 
the nonrenewal process is initiated. Williamson Act 
contracts can be divided into the following 
categories: Prime Agricultural Land, Non-Prim
e Agricultural Land, Open Space Easement, Built 
Up Land, and Agricultural Land in Non-Renewal. None of the project sites are under a 

Williamson Act contract. 
California Public Resources Code section 12220(g) 
The California Public Resources Code defines ﬁforest landﬂ under section 12220(g) as land that 
can support 10-percent native tree cover of any species, including hardwoods, under natural 

conditions, and that allows for ma
nagement of one or more forest resources, including timber, 
aesthetics, fish and wildlife, biodiversity, wate
r quality, recreation, and other public benefits. 
Projects are subject to this code if there are an
y potentially significant changes to existing areas 
zoned as forest land. None of the project sites are zoned as forest land. 
California Public Resources Code section 4526 
The California Public Resources Code defines ﬁtim
berlandﬂ as land, other than land owned by the 
federal government and land designated by the boa
rd as experimental forest land, which is 
available for, and capable of, growing a crop of 
trees of any commercial species used to produce

lumber and other forest products, including Christmas trees. Commercial species shall be 
determined by the board on a district basis af
ter consultation with the district committees and 
others. Project may have significant impacts to ti
mberland if the project conflicts with existing 
zoning. None of the project sites are zoned as timberland. 
California Government Code section 51104(g) 
The California Government Code defines ﬁt
imberland production zoneﬂ under section 51104(g) 
as an area which has been zoned pursuant to Sections 51112 or 51113 and is devoted to and used 

for growing and harvesting timber, or for growi
ng and harvesting timber and compatible uses, as 
defined in subdivision (h) of the Government Code 51104. Projects may significantly impact 

timberland resources if the project conflicts with
 existing areas zoned for timberland production. 
None of the project sites are zoned for timberland production. 
Significance Criteria 
Based on the CEQA Guidelines, a project may be deemed to have a significant effect on the 
environment with respect to agricultural resources if it would: 
 Convert Prime Farmland, or 
Farmland of Statewide Importance, as shown on the maps 
prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping 
and Monitoring Program of the California 
Resources Agency, to non-agricultural use. 
 Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a Williamson Act contract. 
 Conflict with existing zoning for, or cause 
rezoning of, forest land, timberland, or 
timberland zoned Timberland Production. 
 Result in the loss of forest land or conversion of forest land to non-forest use. 
 Involve other changes in the existing environm
ent which, due to their location or nature, 
could result in conversion of Fa
rmland to non-agriculture use 
or conversion of forest land 
to non-forest use. Impacts Discussion 
The following sections discuss the potential effects of the proposed project to agricultural and 
forestry resources according to the key i
ssue areas identified in Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines and corresponding to the significance criteria identified above.  
Prime and Unique Farmland 
According to the maps prepared for the FMMP, 
the sites for the proposed Baker WTP, treated water pipeline, sewer pipeline, Raw Water Pump
 Station, and OC-33 Meter Exchange do not 
contain agricultural resources. The project sites are not designated as Prime, Unique or Important

Farmland. Implementation of the proposed project
 would not convert farmland to non-agricultural 
use. There would be no impact.  
Williamson Act and Agricultural Zoning 
According to the City of Lake Forest™s Zoning 
Map, the proposed Baker site is zoned as General 
Agriculture (A1) (City of Lake Forest, 2008)
. Per Section 9.10.030 of the Zoning Code, 
public/private utility buildings and structures are 
permitted in an A1 zone subject to a site development permit. However, water treatment fac
ilities are not subject to city zoning regulation, 
per Government Code 53091 and therefore a site 
development permit would not be required. The 
proposed project would not conflict with any existing zoning for agricultural use. 
None of the proposed project components are located on lands that are subject to a Williamson 
Act contract. Therefore, the proposed project w
ould not conflict with a Williamson Act contract. There would be no impact. 
Forest Land and Timberland 
None of the project sites have a zoning designati
on associated with forest land, timberland, or 
timberland production. None of the project sites ar
e characterized by forest land. The proposed 
project would not result in the conversion of forest
 land to non-forest uses. There would be no impact.

3.3 Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions This section provides an overview of the existi
ng air quality at the project site and surrounding 
region, the regulatory framework, an analysis of pot
ential impacts to air quality that would result 
from implementation of the project, and 
identification of mitigation measures. 

Climate and Meteorology 
Atmospheric conditions such as wind speed, wind direction, and air temperature gradients interact 
with the physical features of the landscape to determine the movement and dispersal of air 

pollutants. The project sites are located in the c
ities of Lake Forest and Orange in Orange County 
and are within the boundaries of the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB). The Basin, which is a 

subregion of the South Coast Air Quality Manage
ment District™s (SCAQMD) jurisdiction, is 
bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and th
e San Gabriel, San Bernardino, and San Jacinto mountains to the north and east. The topography and climate of southern California combine to 

make the Basin an area of high air pollution po
tential. During the summer months, a warm air 
mass frequently descends over the cool, moist mari
ne layer produced by the interaction between 
the ocean™s surface and the lowest layer of th
e atmosphere. The warm upper layer forms a cap 
over the cool marine layer and inhibits the pollu
tants in the marine layer from dispersing upward. 
In addition, light winds during the summer furt
her limit ventilation. Furthermore, sunlight 
triggers the photochemical reactions which prod
uce ozone. The region experiences more days of 
sunlight than any other major urban area in the nation (SCAQMD, 1993). 
Project Area Setting Existing Air Quality 
The SCAQMD monitors air quality conditions at 38 locations throughout the Basin. Historical 

data from the Mission Viejo Monitoring Station we
re used to characterize existing conditions in 
the vicinity of the proposed project area. Cr
iteria pollutants monitored at the Mission Viejo 
Monitoring Station include ozone (O
3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO
2), and particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM
2.5
). Table 3.3-1
 shows pollutant levels, the 
State standards, and the number of exceedances re
corded at the Mission Viejo Monitoring Station from 2006 to 2008.

  Criteria Air Pollutants The following pollutants are called ﬁcriteriaﬂ air 
pollutants because standard
s have been established 
for each of them to meet specifi
c public health and welfare criteri
a set forth in the Federal Clean 
Air Act (FCAA). California has adopted more stringent ambient air quality standards for the 

criteria air pollutants (referred to as State Ambien
t Air Quality Standards, or state standards) and 
has adopted air quality standards for some pollu
tants for which there is no corresponding national 
standard. 3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

Ozone 
Short-term exposure to ozone can irritate the ey
es and cause constriction of the airways. Besides 
causing shortness of breath, ozone can aggravate existing respiratory diseases such as asthma, 
bronchitis, and emphysema. 
Ozone, the main component of photochemical 
smog, is primarily a summer and fall pollution 
problem. Ozone is not emitted directly into the air but is formed through a complex series of 

chemical reactions involving other compounds that are directly emitted. These directly emitted 

pollutants (also known as ozone precursors) incl
ude reactive organic gases (ROG) and nitrogen 
oxides (NOx). The time period required for ozone
 formation allows the reacting compounds to 
spread over a large area, producing regional 
pollution problems. Ozone problems are the 
cumulative result of regional development pattern
s rather than the result of a few significant 
emission sources.  
Once formed, ozone remains in the atmosphere fo
r one or two days. Ozone is then eliminated 
through reaction with chemicals on the leaves of plants, attachment to water droplets as they fall 
to earth (ﬁrainoutﬂ), or absorption by water molecu
les in clouds that later fall to earth with rain 
(ﬁwashoutﬂ). Carbon Monoxide (CO) 
Carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas, is a non-reactive pollutant that is a product of 

incomplete combustion and is mostly associated
 with motor vehicles. When inhaled at high 
concentrations, carbon monoxide combines with
 hemoglobin in the blood and reduces the 
oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. This resu
lts in reduced oxygen reaching the brain, heart 
and other body tissues. This condition is especially critical for people with cardiovascular 
diseases, chronic lung disease, or anemia. CO measurements and modeling were important in the 

early 1980™s when CO levels were regularly 
exceeded throughout California. In more recent 
years, CO measurements and modeling have not been a priority in most California air districts 

due to the retirement of older polluting ve
hicles, less emissions from new vehicles and 
improvements in fuels.  
Respirable Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5) 
PM10 and PM2.5
 consist of particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter and 
2.5 microns or less in diameter, respectively. (A micron is one-millionth of a meter). PM
10 and PM2.5
 represent fractions of particulate matter that can be inhaled into the air passages and the 
lungs and can cause adverse health effects. Acute 
and chronic health effects associated with high 
particulate levels include the aggravation of chronic respiratory diseases, heart and lung disease, 

and coughing, bronchitis and respiratory illnesses 
in children. Recent mortality studies have 
shown an association between morbidity and morta
lity and daily concentra
tions of particulate matter in the air. The California Air Resources 
Board (CARB) has estimated that achieving the 
ambient air quality standards for PM
10 could reduce premature mortality rates by 6,500 cases per 
year (CARB, 2002). Particulates can also damage materials and reduce visibility. One common 

source of PM2.5
 is diesel particulate emissions.

Final EIR 
April 2011 
Traffic generates particulate matter emissions thro
ugh entrainment of dust and dirt particles that 
settle onto roadways and parking lots. PM
10 also is emitted by burning 
wood in residential wood 
stoves and fireplaces and open agricultural burning. PM
10 can remain in the atmosphere for up to 
seven days before gravitational settling,
 rainout and washout remove it.  
Nitrogen Dioxide 
NO2 is a reddish-brown gas that is a by-pr
oduct of combustion processes. Automobiles and 
industrial operations are the main sources of NO
2. Aside from its contribution to ozone formation, 
nitrogen dioxide can increase the risk of acu
te and chronic respiratory disease and reduce 
visibility. NO
2 may be visible as a coloring component of a brown cloud on high pollution days, 
especially in conjunction with high ozone levels. 
Odorous Emissions Though offensive odors from stationary sources rarely
 cause any physical harm, they still remain 
unpleasant and can lead to public distress generating 
citizen complaints to local governments. The 
occurrence and severity of odor impacts depend on
 the nature, frequency, and intensity of the 
source, wind speed, direction, and the sensitivity of receptors. 
Greenhouse Gases  Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are 
called greenhouse gases. The major concern is that increases in greenhouse gases are causing Global Cl
imate Change. Global Climate Change is a 
change in the average weather on earth that
 can be measured by wind patterns, storms, 
precipitation and temperature. Although there is
 tremendous disagreement as to the speed of 
global warming and the extent of the impacts attributable to human activities, most agree that 

there is a direct link between increased emissi
on of so-called greenhouse gases and long term global temperature. What greenhouse gases have in 
common is that they allow sunlight to enter 
the atmosphere, but trap a portion of the outward
-bound infrared radiation and warm up the air. 
The process is similar to the effect greenhouses have 
in raising the internal temperature, hence the 
name greenhouse gases.  
Both natural processes and human activiti
es emit greenhouse gases. The accumulation of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere regulates the earth™s temperature; however, emissions from 

human activities such as electricity producti
on and motor vehicles have elevated the 
concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmo
sphere. This accumulation of greenhouse gases has 
contributed to an increase in the temperature of the earth™s atmosphere and contributed to Global 

Climate Change. The principal greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO
2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N
2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), perfl
uorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), and water vapor (H2O). Carbon dioxide is the reference 
gas for climate change because it 
gets the most attention and is considered the 
most important greenhouse gas. To account for the 
warming potential of greenhouse gases, greenhou
se gas emissions are often quantified and 
reported as CO2 equivalents (CO
2e). Large emission sources are reported in million metric tons of 
CO2e. HFCs are used in refrigeration systems 
as substitutes for CFCs, which were banned for destroying the ozone layer.

Potential global warming impacts in California may include, but are not limited to, loss in snow 
pack, sea level rise, more extreme heat days per year, more high ozone days, more large forest 

fires, and more drought years (CARB, 2006). Secondary effects are likely to include a global rise 

in sea level, impacts to agriculture, changes in
 disease vectors, and changes in habitat and 
biodiversity. 
Sensitive Land Uses  
Land uses such as schools, children™s daycare 
centers, hospitals, and convalescent homes are 
considered to be more sensitive than the gene
ral public to poor air quality because the population 
groups associated with these uses have increased susceptibility to respiratory distress. Persons 
engaged in strenuous work or exercise also ha
ve increased sensitivity to poor air quality. 
Residential areas are considered more sensitive 
to air quality conditions than commercial and 
industrial areas, because people generally spend longer periods of time at their residences, 
resulting in greater exposure to ambient air quality conditions.  
The nearest sensitive receptors to the proposed 
project sites are residential land uses in close 
proximity to the Baker site, treated water pi
peline alternative corridors and sewer pipeline 
corridor (see Figure 2-2 in Chapter 2, Project Description). Residents on Palmwood, Wisteria, 

Oakville, and Marin would be as close as 100 feet from the construction zone of the Baker WTP 
and as close as 30 feet from the construction zone of the treated water pipeline. Residents on 
Fallenwood would be as close as 30 feet from the construction zone of the proposed sewer 

pipeline. Sensitive receptors in Irvine Regional Pa
rk would be approximately 500 feet from the 
OC-33 site. Federal 
The federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) requires the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) 
to identify National Ambient Air Quality Standard
s (NAAQS or national standards) to protect 
public health and welfare. National standards 
have been established for ozone, carbon monoxide, 
nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, PM10, PM2.5, and lead. 
Table 3.3-2 shows current national and 
state ambient air quality standards and provides a br
ief discussion of the related health effects and 
principal sources for each pollutant. 
Pursuant to the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Am
endments (FCAAA), the USEPA classifies air 
basins (or portions thereof) as ﬁattainmentﬂ or ﬁ
nonattainmentﬂ for each criteria air pollutants, 
based on whether or not the NAAQS had been achieved.  
The FCAA requires each state to prepare an air 
quality control plan referred to as the State 
Implementation Plan (SIP). The FCAAA added requirements for states containing areas that 

violate the NAAQS to revise their SIPs to incorporate additional control measures to reduce air 
pollution. The SIP is a living document that is peri
odically modified to reflect the latest emissions 
inventories, planning documents, and rules and re
gulations of air basins as reported by the

agencies with jurisdiction over them. The USEPA 
has responsibility to review all state SIPs to 
determine if they conform to the mandates of 
the FCAAA and will achieve air quality goals when 
implemented. If the USEPA determines a SIP 
to be inadequate, it may prepare a Federal 
Implementation Plan (FIP) for the nonattainme
nt area and may impose additional control 
measures. Failure to submit an approvable SIP 
or to implement the plan within mandated 
timeframes can result in sanctions being applied to transportation funding and stationary air 
pollution sources in the air basin. 
Regulation of Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs)
, termed Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) under 
federal regulations, is achieved through federal, State and local controls on individual sources. 
The 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments require
d the USEPA to identify National Emission 
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) to
 protect public health and welfare. These 
substances include certain volatile organic chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, and radionuclides 
that present a tangible hazard, based on scientific studies of exposure to humans and other 

mammals. There is uncertainty in the precise degree of hazard. 
State The CARB manages air quality, regulates mobile em
issions sources, and oversees the activities of county Air Pollution Control Districts (APCDs) a
nd regional Air Quality Management Districts 
(AQMDs). CARB establishes state ambient air qualit
y standards and vehicle emissions standards. 
California has adopted ambient standards that are mo
re stringent than the federal standards for the 
criteria air pollutants. These are shown in Table 3.3-2. Under the California Clean Air Act 

(CCAA) patterned after the FCAA, areas have been designated as attainment or nonattainment 
with respect to the state standards. 
Table 3.3-3 
summarizes the attainment status with California 
standards in the project vicinity. 
Toxic Air Contaminants 
California State law defines toxic air contaminan
ts (TACs) as air pollutants having carcinogenic 
effects. The State Air Toxics Program was est
ablished in 1983 under Assembly Bill (AB) 1807 
(Tanner). A total of 243 substances have been designated TACs under California law; they 
include the 189 (federal) hazardous air pollutant
s (HAPs) adopted in accordance with AB 2728. 
The Air Toxics ﬁHot Spotsﬂ Information and Assessment Act of 1987 (AB 2588) seeks to 
identify and evaluate risk from air toxics sources; however, AB 2588 does not regulate air toxics 

emissions. Toxic air contaminant emissions 
from individual facilities are quantified and 
prioritized. ﬁHigh-priorityﬂ facilities are required 
to perform a health risk assessment and, if 
specific thresholds are violated, are required to co
mmunicate the results to the public in the form 
of notices and public meetings.  
In August of 1998, CARB identified particulate emissions from diesel-fueled engines (diesel 
particulate matter, or DPM) as TACs
. CARB subsequently developed the 
Risk Reduction Plan to 
Reduce Particulate Matter Emissions from Diesel-Fueled Engines and Vehicles
 (CARB, 2000). The document represents proposals to reduce diesel particulate emissions, with the goal of

  reducing emissions and associated health risks by 
75 percent in 2010 and by 85 percent in 2020. 
The program aims to require the use of state-of-the-art catalyzed diesel particulate filters and ultra 

low sulfur diesel fuel on diesel-fueled engines.  
CARB recently published the 
Air Quality and Land Use Handbook: A Community Health 
Perspective
 (CARB, 2005). The primary goal in deve
loping the handbook was to provide 
information that will help keep California™s ch
ildren and other vulnerable populations out of 
harm™s way with respect to nearby sources of air pollution. The handbook highlights recent 

studies that have shown that public exposure to air pollution can be substantially elevated near freeways and certain other facilities (i.e., distributio
n centers, rail yards, chrome platers, etc.). 
However, the health risk is greatly reduced with
 distance. For that reason, CARB provided some 
general recommendations aimed at keeping appropr
iate distances between sources of air pollution 
and sensitive land uses, such as residences. 
Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases 
Assembly Bill 1493 (Pavley) 
In 2002, then-Governor Gray Davis signed AB 1493 (Chapter 200, Statutes of 2002, amending 
Section 42823 of the California Health and Safety
 Code and adding Section 43018.5 to the code). 
AB 1493 required CARB to develop and adopt, by Ja
nuary 1, 2005, regulations that achieve ﬁthe 
maximum feasible reduction of
 GHGs emitted by passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks and 
other vehicles determined by CARB to be vehicl
es whose primary use is noncommercial personal 
transportation in the State.ﬂ 3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

To meet the requirements of AB 1493, CARB appr
oved amendments to the California Code of 
Regulations (ﬁCCRﬂ) in 2004 by adding GHG em
issions standards to California™s existing 
standards for motor vehicle emissions. The 
regulations would reduce GHG emissions from 
California passenger vehicles by about 22 pe
rcent by 2012 and about 30 percent by 2016.
1 USEPA denied California™s request for the waiver to implement AB 1493 in late December 2007. 
California filed a suit against USEPA for its decision to deny the CAA waiver. On January 21, 
2009, CARB submitted a letter to USEPA Administra
tor Jackson regarding California's request to 
reconsider the waiver denial. USEPA approved the waiver on June 30, 2009. 
Executive Order S-3-05 
In 2005, in recognition of California™s vulnerabilit
y to the effects of climate change, Governor 
Schwarzenegger established Executive Order S-3-05, 
which sets forth a series of target dates by 
which statewide emission of greenhouse gas would be progressively reduced, as follows:  
 By 2010, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels; 
 By 2020, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels; and 
 By 2050, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels. 
The executive order directed the Secretary of 
the California Environmental Protection Agency 
(ﬁCalEPAﬂ) to coordinate a multi-agency effort 
to reduce GHG emissions to the target levels. The 
Secretary must submit biannual reports to the go
vernor and California Legislature describing the progress made toward the emissions targets, the impacts of global climate change on California™s 
resources, and mitigation and adaptation plans to
 combat these impacts. 
To comply with the 
executive order, the Secretary of CalEPA created the California Climate Action Team (ﬁCATﬂ), 
made up of members from various state agencies and commissions. The CAT released its first 
report in March 2006. The report proposed to ach
ieve the targets by building on the voluntary 
actions of California businesses, local government
s, and communities and through state incentive 
and regulatory programs.  
Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32) 
In 2006, California passed the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Assembly Bill 

No. 32; California Health and Safety Code Divi
sion 25.5, Sections 38500, et seq., or AB 32), 
which requires the CARB to design and implem
ent emission limits, regulations, and other 
measures, such that statewide greenhouse gas emi
ssions will be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. 
This reduction will be accomplished by enforcing 
a statewide cap on GHG emissions that will be 
phased in starting in 2012. To effectively impl
ement the cap, AB 32 directs CARB to develop and 
implement regulations to reduce statewide 
GHG emissions. Under AB 32, CARB must adopt 
regulations by January 1, 2011 
to achieve reductions in GHGs to meet the 1990 emissions cap by 
2020.

In December 2007, CARB approved the 2020 emissi
on limit of 427 million metric tons of CO
2e. The 2020 target of 427 million metric tons of CO
2e requires the reduction of 169 million metric 
tons of CO2e, or approximately 30 percent, from the state™s projected 2020 emissions of 596 
million metric tons of CO
2e (business-as-usual).  
Also in December 2007, CARB adopted mandato
ry reporting and verification regulations 
pursuant to AB 32. The regulations became effec
tive on January 1, 2009, with the first reports 
covering 2008 emissions. The mandatory reporting 
regulations require reporting for certain types of facilities that make up the bulk of the stationa
ry source emissions in California. Currently, the 
draft regulation language identifies major facilities as
 those that generate more than 25,000 metric 
tons/year of CO
2e. Cement plants, oil refineries, electric-ge
nerating facilities/providers, cogeneration 
facilities, and hydrogen plants and other stationary combustion sources that emit more than 25,000 

metric tons/year CO
2e, make up 94 percent of the point source CO
2e emissions in California 
(CARB, 2007c). In June, 2008, CARB published its 
Climate Change Draft Scoping Plan
 (CARB, 2008a). The 
Climate Change Draft Scoping Plan
 reported that CARB met the first milestones set by AB 32 in 
2007: developing a list of early actions to be
gin sharply reducing greenhouse gas emissions; 
assembling an inventory of historic emissions
; and establishing the 2020 emissions limit. On 
December 11, 2008 CARB adopted its 
Climate Change Scoping Plan
, which functions as a 
roadmap of CARB™s plans to achieve GHG reduc
tions in California required by AB 32 through 
subsequently enacted regulations (CARB, 2008b). The 
Scoping Plan
 proposes a comprehensive 
set of actions designed to reduce overall carbon em
issions in California. Key elements of the 
Scoping Plan
 include: 
 Expanding and strengthening existing energy efficiency programs as well as building and 
appliance standards; 
 Achieving a statewide renewables energy mix of 33 percent; 
 Developing a California cap-and-trade program that links with other Western Climate 
Initiative partner programs to create a regional market system; 
 Establishing targets for transportation-re
lated greenhouse gas emissions for regions 
throughout California, and pursuing policies 
and incentives to achieve those targets;  Adopting and implementing measures pursuant 
to existing state laws and policies, including California™s clean car standards, goods movement measures, and the Low 

Carbon Fuel Standard; and  
 Creating targeted fees, including a public goods charge on water use, fees on high global 
warming potential gases, and a fee to fund th
e administrative costs of the state™s long-
term commitment to AB 32 implementation. (CARB, 2008b) 
CARB has not yet determined what amount of 
GHG emissions reductions it recommends from 
local government land us
e decisions; however, the 
Scoping Plan
 does state that successful 
implementation of the plan relies on local governments™ land use planning and urban growth 

decisions because local governments have primar
y authority to plan, zone, approve, and permit 
land development to accommodate population growth and the changing needs of their 

jurisdictions. CARB further acknowledges that 
decisions on how land is used will have large

effects on the GHG emissions that will result from th
e transportation, housing, industry, forestry, 
water, agriculture, electricity, and natural gas emission sectors. The 
Scoping Plan
 states that the ultimate assignment to local government operati
ons is to be determined (CARB, 2008b). 
The Climate Change Scoping Plan
 also includes recommended measures that were developed to 
reduce GHG emissions from key sources and activiti
es while improving public health, promoting 
a cleaner environment, preserving our natural resources, and ensuring that the impacts of the 

reductions are equitable and do not disproportiona
tely impact low-income and minority communities. 
These measures, shown below in 
Table 3.3-4 by sector, also put the state on a path to meet the 
long-term 2050 goal of reducing California™s GHG 
emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels.  The total reduction for the recommended measures is 174 million metric tons/year of CO
2e, slightly exceeding the 169 million metric tons/year of CO
2e of reductions estimated to be needed 
in the Draft Scoping Plan
. The measures in the Scoping Plan approved by the Board will be 
developed over the next two years and be in place by 2012.

 Executive Order S-1-07 
Executive Order S-1-07, which was signed by Gove
rnor Schwarzenegger in 2007, proclaims that 
the transportation sector is the main source of GHG emissions in California, generating more than 
40 percent of statewide emissions. It establis
hes a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of 
transportation fuels sold in California by at l
east ten percent by 2020. This order also directs 
CARB to determine whether this Low Carbon Fu
el Standard (ﬁLCFSﬂ) has been adopted as a 
discrete early-action measure as part of the effort to meet the mandates in AB 32.  
The LCFS will reduce GHG emissions from the tran
sportation sector in California by about 16 
million metric tons in 2020. The LCFS is 
designed to reduce California™s dependence on petroleum, create a lasting ma
rket for clean transportation technology, and stimulate the 
production and use of alternative, low-carbon fuels in California.  
California Air Pollution Control Officers Association 
In January 2008, the California Air Pollution C
ontrol Officers Association (CAPCOA) issued a 
ﬁwhite paperﬂ on evaluating and addressing GHGs under CEQA (CAPCOA, 2008). This resource guide was prepared to support local governments as they develop their programs and policies 

around climate change issues. The paper is not a gu
idance document. It is not intended to dictate 
or direct how any agency chooses to address GHG 
emissions. Rather, it is intended to provide a 
common platform of information about key elements of CEQA as they pertain to GHG, including 

an analysis of different approaches 
to setting significance thresholds.  
The paper notes that for a variety of reasons 
local agencies may decide not to have a CEQA 
threshold. Local agencies may also decide
 to assess projects on a case-by-case basis when the 
projects come forward. The paper also discusses a range of GHG emission thresholds that could 

be used. The range of thresholds includes a GHG threshold of zero and several non-zero

thresholds. Non-zero thresholds include percenta
ge reductions for new projects that would allow 
the state to meet its goals for GHG emissions re
ductions by 2020 and pe
rhaps 2050. These would 
be determined by a comparison of new emissi
ons versus business-as-usual emissions and the 
reductions required would be a
pproximately 30 percent to achieve 2020 goals and 90 percent 
(effectively immediately) to achieve the more 
aggressive 2050 goals. These goals could be varied 
to apply differently to new project, by economic sector, or by region in the state. 
Other non-zero thresholds discussed in the paper include: 
 900 metric tons/year CO
2e (a market capture approach); 
 10,000 metric tons/year CO
2e (potential CARB mandatory reporting level with Cap and 
Trade);  25,000 metric tons/year CO
2e (the CARB mandatory repor
ting level for the statewide emissions inventory);  
 40,000 to 50,000 metric tons/year CO
2e (regulated emissions inventory capture Œ using 
percentages equivalent to those used in 
air districts for criteria air pollutants),  
 Projects of statewide importance (9,000 metric tons/year CO
2e for residential, 13,000 metric tons/year CO
2e for office project, and 41,000 metric tons/year CO
2e for retail projects), and  
 Unit-based thresholds and efficiency-based thres
holds that were not quantified in the report. OPR 2009 CEQA Guideline Amendments 
for GHG Emissions/ Senate Bill 97  Senate Bill (SB) 97, signed in August 2007 (Cha
pter 185, Statutes of 2007; Public Resources 
Code Sections 21083.05 and 21097), acknowledge
d that climate change is a prominent 
environmental issue that requires analysis under 
CEQA. This bill directed the Governor™s Office 
of Planning and Research (OPR), which is part of the state Natural Resour
ces Agency, to 
prepare, develop, and transmit to CARB gu
idelines for the feasible mitigation of GHG 
emissions (or the effects of GHG emissions), as required by CEQA, by July 1, 2009.  On 

December 31, 2009, the Natural Resources Agency delivered its rulemaking package to the 

Office of Administrative Law for their review pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. 

The adopted amendments to the CEQA Guide
lines became effective on March 18, 2010. 
OPR™s 2008 Technical Advisory 
On June 19, 2008, OPR published a technical
 advisory on CEQA and Climate Change. The 
advisory provided OPR™s perspective on the emerging role of CEQA in addressing climate 

change and greenhouse gas emissions, while rec
ognizing that approaches and methodologies for 
calculating greenhouse gas emissions and addressing environmental impacts through CEQA 

review are rapidly evolving. The advisory recognized that OPR would develop, and the 

Resources Agency would adopt, amendments to the 
State CEQA Guidelines pursuant to SB 97 as 
was done earlier this year. The technical advisory pointed out that neither CEQA nor the 
CEQA Guidelines prescribe quantitative thresholds of significance or particular methodologies for 
performing an impact analysis. ﬁThis is left to
 lead agency judgment and discretion, based upon 
factual data and guidance from regulatory agencies and other sources where available and

April 2011 
applicableﬂ (OPR, 2008). This deference to lead agen
cies was memorialized in the 
CEQA Guidelines section 15064.4 as discussed below.
 OPR recommended, at the time, that ﬁthe global 
nature of climate change warrants investigation 
of a statewide threshold of significance for GHG 
emissionsﬂ (OPR, 2008).  
Until such a standard is established, OPR advises that each lead agency should develop its own 
approach to performing an analysis for project
s that generate greenhouse gas emissions (OPR, 
2008). Agencies should then assess whether the emissi
ons are ﬁcumulatively considerableﬂ even 
though a project™s greenhouse gas emissions may 
be individually limited. OPR states: ﬁAlthough 
climate change is ultimately a cumulative impact
, not every individual project that emits GHGs 
must necessarily be found to contribute to a 
significant cumulative impact on the environmentﬂ 
(OPR, 2008). Individual lead agencies may undertake a project-by-project analysis, consistent 
with available guidance and current CEQA practice (OPR, 2008).  If the lead agency determines emissions are a 
cumulatively considerable contribution to a 
significant cumulative impact, then
 the lead agency must investigate and implement ways to 
mitigate the emissions (OPR, 2008).
 OPR states: ﬁMitigation measures will vary with the type of 
project being contemplated, but may include alterna
tive project designs or locations that conserve energy and water, measures that reduce vehicle m
iles traveled (VMT) by fossil-fueled vehicles, 
measures that contribute to established regiona
l or programmatic mitigation strategies, and 
measures that sequester carbon to offset the emissions from the projectﬂ (OPR, 2008).
 OPR concludes that ﬁA lead agency is not responsib
le for wholly eliminating all GHG emissions from 
a project; the CEQA standard is to mitigate to a 
level that is ﬁless than significantﬂ (OPR, 2008). 
The technical advisory includes a list of mitiga
tion measures that can be applied on a project-by-
project basis. GHG Amendments to the CEQA Guidelines 
On April 13, 2009, OPR submitted to the S
ecretary for Natural Resources its proposed 
amendments to the 
State CEQA Guidelines for GHG emissions, as required by Public Resources 
Code section 21083.05 (Senate Bill 97) (OPR, 2009)
. As noted above, the Natural Resources 
Agency adopted the 
State CEQA Guidelines
 Amendments with minor, 
non-substantial changes on 
December 31, 2009 and transmitted the Adopted Am
endments and the entire rulemaking file to 
the Office of Administrative Law (OAL). The a
dopted guidelines became effective on March 18, 
2010.  
No quantitative significance threshold 
is included in the Amendments. The 
CEQA Guidelines afford the customary deference provided to lead
 agencies in their analysis and methodologies. 
OPR emphasizes the necessity of having a consistent
 threshold available to analyze projects, and 
the analyses should be performed based on the best 
available information. For example, if a lead 
agency determines that GHGs may be generated 
by a proposed project, the agency is responsible 
for assessing GHG emissions by type and source. The 
CEQA Guidelines Amendments provide 
the following recommendations for determining 
the significance of GHG emissions under Section 
15064.4:

Final EIR 
April 2011 
(a) The determination of the significance of GHG emissions calls for a careful judgment by 
the
 lead agency consistent with the provisions in Section 15064. A lead agency should 
make a good-faith effort, based on available information, to describe, calculate or 
estimate the amount of GHG emissions resulting 
from a project. A lead agency shall have 
discretion to determine, in the context of a particular project, whether to: 
(1) Use a model or methodology to quantify GHG emissions resulting from a project, 
and which model or methodology to use. The lead agency has discretion to select the 
model it considers most appropriate provided
 it supports its decision with substantial 
evidence. The lead agency should explain th
e limitations of the particular model or 
methodology selected for use; and/or 
(2) Rely on a 
qualitative
 analysis or performance based standards. 
(b) A lead agency
 may consider the following when
 assessing the significance of impacts 
from GHG emissions on the environment: 
(1) 
The extent to which the project may increase or reduce GHG emissions as compared 
to the existing environmental setting; 
(2) Whether the project emissions exceed a thr
eshold of significance that the lead agency 
determines applies to the project; and 
(3) The extent to which the project complies with regulations or requirements adopted to 
implement a statewide, regional, or local plan for the reduction or mitigation of GHG 
emissions. Such regulations or requirements 
must be adopted by the relevant public 
agency through a public review process a
nd must include specific requirements that 
reduce or mitigate the project™s incremen
tal contribution of GHG emissions. If there is substantial evidence that the possible effects of a particular project are still cumulatively considerable notwithstanding 
compliance with the adopted regulations 
or requirements, an EIR must be prepared for the project.  
The Amendments also include a new Subdivision 15064.7(c) to clarify that in developing 
thresholds of significance, a lead agency may appr
opriately review thresholds developed by other 
public agencies, or recommended by other experts,
 provided the decision of the lead agency to 
adopt such thresholds is suppor
ted by substantial evidence.  
Finally, the Amendments include a new Section 15183.5 that provides for tiering and 
streamlining the analysis of GHG emissions. Proj
ect-specific environmental documents may rely 
on an EIR containing a programmatic analysis of GHG emissions in the region over a specified 

time period.  In addition, the Amendments add a new set 
of environmental checklist questions (VII. Greenhouse Gas Emissions) to the 
State CEQA Guidelines
 Appendix G. The new set includes the 
following two questions:

Would the project: 
a)  Generate GHG emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant impact 
on the environment?  
b)  Conflict with an applicable plan, policy 
or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing 
the emissions of greenhouse gases?  
CARB Draft GHG Significance Thresholds 
On October 24, 2008, CARB released its 
Preliminary Draft Staff Proposal on Recommended 
Approaches for Setting Interim Significan
ce Thresholds for Greenhouse Gases under the 
California Environmental Quality Act
 for review and public comment (CARB, 2008c). The proposal identifies benchmarks or standards th
at assist lead agencies in the significance 
determination for industrial, residential, and commercial projects. Staff intended to make its final 

recommendations on thresholds in early 2009, consistent with OPR™s timeline for issuing draft 

CEQA guidelines addressing GHG emissions; however, as of June 2010, CARB has yet to issue 

a final recommendation for GHG significance thresholds.  
The proposal currently focuses on two sectors for 
which local agencies are typically the CEQA 
lead agency: industrial projects; and residentia
l and commercial projects. Future proposals will focus on transportation projects, large dairies and power plant projects.  
For industrial projects, CARB recommends that projects below the industrial screening level 
(7,000 metric tons/year CO
2e not including traffic emissions) can be found to be less-than-
significant. For residential and commercial projec
ts, CARB staff's objective is to develop a 
threshold on performance standards that will 
substantially reduce the GHG emissions from new 
projects and streamline the permitting of carbon-ef
ficient projects. Performance standards will 
address the five major emission sub-sources for the sector: energy use, transportation, water use, 

waste, and construction. Projects may alternatively incorporate mitigation equivalent to these 

performance standards, such as measures from green building rating systems. 
Local 
South Coast Air Quality Management District 
The 1977 Lewis Air Quality Management Act cr
eated the SCAQMD to coordinate air quality 
planning efforts throughout Southern California.
 This Act merged four county air pollution 
control agencies into one regional district to better address the issue of improving air quality in 
Southern California. Under the Act, renamed th
e Lewis-Presley Air Quality Management Act in 
1988, the SCAQMD is the agency principally res
ponsible for comprehensive air pollution control 
in the region. Specifically, the SCAQMD is res
ponsible for monitoring air quality, as well as 
planning, implementing, and enforcing programs 
designed to attain and maintain State and 
federal ambient air quality standards in the dist
rict. Programs that were developed include air quality rules and regulations that regulate sta
tionary sources, area sources, point sources, and 
certain mobile source emissions. The SCAQMD is 
also responsible for establishing stationary

source permitting requirements and for ensuring th
at new, modified, or relocated stationary 
sources do not create net emission increases.  
The SCAQMD monitors air quality within the 
proposed project area. The SCAQMD has 
jurisdiction over an area of 10,743 square mil
es, consisting of Orange County; the non-desert 
portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San 
Bernardino counties; and the Riverside County 
portion of the Salton Sea Air Basin and Mojave Desert Air Basin. The SCAB is a subregion of 

the SCAQMD and covers an area of 6,745 square mi
les. The Basin includes all of Orange County 
and the non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties. The Basin is 
bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west; th
e San Gabriel, San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains to the north and east; and th
e San Diego County line to the south. 
Air Quality Management Plan 
All areas designated as nonattainment under the 
CCAA are required to prepare plans showing 
how the area would meet the State air quality standards by its attainment dates. The Air Quality 

Management Plan (AQMP) is the region™s plan
 for improving air quality in the region. It 
addresses CAA and CCAA requirements and demonstrates attainment with State and federal 

ambient air quality standards. The AQMP is prep
ared by SCAQMD and the Southern California 
Association of Governments (SCAG). The AQMP provides policies and control measures that 
reduce emissions to attain both State and federal 
ambient air quality standards by their applicable 
deadlines. Environmental review of individual projects within the Basin must demonstrate that 

daily construction and operati
onal emissions thresholds, as established by the SCAQMD, would 
not be exceeded. The environmental review must 
also demonstrate that individual projects would 
not increase the number or severity of
 existing air quality violations. The 2007 AQMP was adopted by the SCAQMD 
on June 1, 2007. The 2007 AQMP proposes 
attainment demonstration of the federal PM
2.5
 standards through a more focused control of SO
X, directly-emitted PM
2.5
, and NOX supplemented with VOC by 2015. The eight-hour ozone control 
strategy builds upon the PM
2.5
 strategy, augmented with additional NO
X and VOC reductions to meet the standard by 2024. The 2007 AQMP also
 addresses several federal planning requirements 
and incorporates significant new scientific data, 
primarily in the form of updated emissions 
inventories, ambient measurements, new meteor
ological episodes, and new air quality modeling 
tools. The 2007 AQMP is consistent with a
nd builds upon the approaches taken in the 2003 
AQMP. However, the 2007 AQMP highlights the significant amount of reductions needed and 

the urgent need to identify additional strategies, 
especially in the area of mobile sources, to meet 
all federal criteria pollutant standards with
in the time frames allowed under the CAA. 
Air Toxics Control Plan 
The SCAQMD has a long and successful history of reducing air toxics and criteria emissions in 
the Basin. SCAQMD has an extensive control pr
ogram, including traditional and innovative rules 
and policies. These policies can 
be viewed in the SCAQMD™s 
Air Toxics Control Plan for the 
Next Ten Years
 (March, 2000). To date, the most comprehensive study on air toxics in the Basin 
is the Multiple Air Toxics Exposure Study (MATES-III), conducted by the SCAQMD. The

monitoring program measured more than 30 air po
llutants, including both gases and particulates. 
The monitoring study was accompanied by a computer modeling study in which SCAQMD 

estimated the risk of cancer from breathing to
xic air pollution throughout the region based on 
emissions and weather data. MATES-III found that the cancer risk in the region from 

carcinogenic air pollutants ranges from about 870 in a million to 1,400 in a million, with an 

average regional risk of about 1,200 in a million. 
Greenhouse Gasses On December 5, 2008, the SCAQM
D Governing Board adopted the 
staff proposal for an interim 
GHG significance threshold for projects where 
the SCAQMD is the lead agency and which 
involve stationary sources. The adopted interim thr
eshold consists of five tiers of standards that could result in a finding of less than significant impact. The tiers include CEQA exemptions, 
consistency with regional GHG budgets, less than
 significant screening levels for industrial projects (10,000 metric tons/year CO
2e) and commercial/residential projects (3,000 metric 
tons/year CO
2e), performance standards (i.e., 30 percent less than Business As Usual [BAU]), and 
carbon offsets (SCAQMD, 2008).  
Significance Criteria 
CEQA Guidelines 
According to CEQA Guidelines Appendix G, the project would have a significant effect on air 
quality if it would: 
 Conflict with or obstruct implementation 
of the applicable air quality plan;  
 Violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air 
quality violation; 
 Result in a cumulatively considerable ne
t increase of any nonattainment pollutant 
(including releasing emissions that exceed qua
ntitative thresholds for ozone precursors);  Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations;  
 Create objectionable odors affecting a 
substantial number of people; or 
 Generate greenhouse gas emissions, 
either directly or indirectly
, that may have a significant 
impact on the environment; or 
 Conflict with an applicable plan, policy or
 regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing 
the emissions of greenhouse gases. 
Construction 
The proposed project would result in a significant construction air quality impact if emissions 
from the proposed project exceed the si

  Operations 
The proposed project would result in a significant operational air quality impact if either of the 
following occur:  Emissions exceed the significance thresholds set forth in Table 3.3-5. 
 The proposed project would not be compatible with SCAQMD air quality goals and 
policies.  The proposed project would generate signifi
cant emissions of Toxic Air Contaminants 
(TACs); 
Greenhouse Gases At this time few if any local governments statewide have adopted anything beyond a case-by-case 
significance criterion for evaluating a project™s 
contribution to climate change. The OPR has 
asked the CARB to ﬁrecommend a method for settin
g thresholds of significance to encourage 
consistency and uniformity in the CEQA analysis of GHG emissionsﬂ throughout the state 

because OPR has recognized that ﬁthe global nature 
of climate change warrants investigation of a 
statewide threshold for GHG emissionsﬂ (O
PR, 2008). CARB began the public process of 
addressing significance thresholds in October 2008, bu
t many decisions need to be made to have 
final criteria (CARB, 2008c).  The informal guidelines in OPR™s technical advi
sory and CARB™s proposed thresholds provide a 
general basis for determining a proposed project
™s contribution of greenhouse gas emissions and 
the project™s contribution to global climate change. In the absence of adopted statewide 

thresholds, OPR recommends the following appr
oach for analyzing greenhouse gas emissions: 
1) Identify and quantify the project™s greenhouse gas emissions; 
2) Assess the significance of the impact on climate change; and  
3) If the impact is found to be significant, identify alternatives and/ or mitigation measures 
that would reduce the impact to less than significant levels.  
OPR™s technical advisory states that ﬁthe most
 common GHG that results from human activity is 
carbon dioxide, followed by methane and nitrous 
oxide.ﬂ State law defines GHG to also include

hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur
 hexafluoride. These latter GHG compounds are 
usually emitted in industrial processes, and ther
efore not applicable to the proposed project; however, the GHG calculation should include emissions from CO
2, N2O, and CH4, as recommended by OPR. The informal guidelines also
 advise that lead agencies should calculate, 
or estimate, emissions from vehicular traffic, 
energy consumption, water usage and construction 
activities.  As discussed above, at this time there are 
no statewide guidelines for greenhouse gas emission 
impacts, but this will be addressed through the provi
sions of SB 97. OPR has until July 1, 2009 to 
draft the new greenhouse gas guidelines, and the State Resources Agency will thereafter have 

until January 1, 2010 to certify and adopt the regulations. In the interim local agencies must 

analyze the impact of GHGs. For this analysis
, the project would be considered to have a 
significant impact if the project would be in conflict with the AB 32 State goals for reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. We assume that AB 32 will be successful in reducing GHG emissions 

and reducing the cumulative GHG emissions statewide 
by 2020. It is important that the state has 
taken these measures, because no project indivi
dually could have a major impact (either 
positively or negatively) on the global concentr
ation of GHG. The project will be reviewed to 
make sure it does not conflict with the goals of AB 32.  
Methodology 
Construction Impacts 
Daily construction emissions were forecast by us
ing default values from the air quality emissions 
model URBEMIS 2007 version 9.2.4. URBEMIS 2007 output sheets are provided in 
Appendix B
 of this document.  
Operational Impacts Operational emissions were determined by 
estimating greenhouse gasses through indirect electricity usage provided by the applicant and 
formulas and emission factors from The California 
Climate Action Registry Report Protocol 2006.  
Impacts Discussion 
Consistency with Air Quality Management Plans 
The proposed project would not conflict with th
e applicable Air Quality Management Plan 
(AQMP). The project site is located within 
the SCAB. The SCAQMD regulates air emissions in 
the SCAB. The SCAQMD is required to reduce em
issions of criteria pollutants for which the 
SCAB is in non-attainment. Strategies to achieve these emissions reductions are developed in the 
AQMP, prepared by SCAQMD for the region. SCAG has established the assumptions for growth, 
in terms of demographic growth and associated air quality impacts, and these assumptions are 

utilized in SCAQMD™s 2007 AQMP. The 2007 AQMP is designed to meet both State and federal 

CAA planning requirements for all areas under SCAQMD jurisdiction. The 2007 AQMP focuses

on reduction strategies for ozone and particul
ate matter and sets forth procedures for 
measurements, control strategies, and air quality modeling (SCAQMD, 2003). 
The proposed project does not include residential development or large local or regional 
employment centers and thus, would not result in
 significant population or employment growth. 
The project is intended to provide increased water supply reliability in southern Orange County 
by creating redundancy of treatment system capacity and distribution infrastructure for potable 

water. Consequently, implementation of the prop
osed project would be consistent with AQMP 
attainment forecasts. Therefore, no impact would occur.  
Violation of an Air Quality Standard  
Impact 3.3-1: The proposed project could violate an air quality standard or contribute 
substantially to an existing or projected ai
r quality violation during its construction and 
operation. (Less than Significant) 
Construction 
Construction emissions were estimated usi
ng the URBEMIS2007 model developed by CARB 
(See Appendix B). It is mandatory for all constr
uction projects in the SCAB to comply with 
SCAQMD Rule 403 for controlling fugitive dust. 
Incorporating Rule 403 into the proposed 
project would reduce regional respirable particulate matter (PM
10) and fine particulate matter 
(PM2.5
) emissions from construction activities. Speci
fic Rule 403 control requirements include, 
but are not limited to, applying water in sufficien
t quantities to prevent the generation of visible 
dust plumes, applying soil binde
rs to uncovered areas, reestablishing ground cover as quickly as 
possible, utilizing a wheel washing system to remove bulk material from tires and vehicle 

undercarriages before vehicles exit the proposed project site, and maintaining effective cover over 
exposed areas. Compliance with Rule 403 ensures 
that the proposed project would comply with 
SCAQMD thresholds. Site watering and applicati
on of soil binders would reduce the particulate 
matter from becoming airborne, while washing 
of transport vehicle tires and undercarriages 
would reduce re-entrainment of constructi
on dust onto the local roadway network.  
Maximum daily construction-relate
d regional emissions for the proposed project are presented in 
Table 3.3-6. As shown, construction emissions
 would not exceed the SCAQMD daily 
significance thresholds for reactive organic gases (ROG), NOx, CO, PM
2.5
 and PM
10. Carbon 
dioxide (CO2) thresholds have not yet been develope
d. Since construction emissions would not 
exceed the SCAQMD thresholds, the regional construc
tion impact would be less than significant. 
Operation 
Operational emissions for the proposed project
 would be generated primarily from on-road 
vehicular traffic. Minimal employee trips woul
d be required daily for routine operations, 
inspection and maintenance, and these minimal 
trips would result in a less-than-significant 
increase in emissions to the local air quality environment.

3.3 Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 3.3-24 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
Operational emissions would include an increase 
of approximately 26,700 mega-watt hours per 
year. Energy would be provided to the site 
by SCE. No off-site improvements will be necessary 
to provide the energy to operate the plant at fu
ll capacity. The facility will be connected to the existing grid infrastructure connected to the site
. Since the project would provide water treatment 
in place of the existing Diemer Treatment Plant, 
the emissions associated with off-site energy 
production would not be additive to the existing 
condition, but would repl
ace emissions generated by the current demand. Therefore, the proposed 
project would not increase air emissions that 
could violate any air quality standard or cont
ribute substantially to an existing air quality 
violation. Impacts would be less than significant, and no mitigation is required. 
Mitigation Measures
 None required. 
  Cumulative Air Emissions 
Impact 3.3-2: The proposed project could result
 in a cumulatively considerable net increase 
of any criteria pollutant under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard. 

(Less than Significant) 
The construction and operational impacts of 
the proposed project would not exceed the 
SCAQMD™s thresholds and therefore would not be
 expected to be cumulatively considerable. 
With respect to nearby, related past, present and/
or foreseeable future projects (either overlapping 
construction periods or on-going 
operation), it is possible that emission increases for certain air 
pollutants could exceed the SCAQMD™s emission 
thresholds. However, per CEQA Guidelines Section 15064(h)(4), the mere existence of signifi
cant cumulative impacts caused by other related 
projects alone shall not constitute substantial evidence that the proposed project™s incremental 
effects are cumulatively considerable. Development 
of the proposed project would not result in a 
cumulatively considerable net increase of any crite
ria pollutant. Impacts would be considered less than significant, and no mitigation is required. 
Mitigation Measures
 None required. 
  Effects on Sensitive Receptors 
Impact 3.3-3: The proposed project could expo
se sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant 
concentrations. (Less than Significant)

 3.3-25 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
Some land uses are considered more sensitive 
to air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and 
toxic air contaminants, than others. Residences,
 hotels, schools, rest homes, and hospitals are 
generally more sensitive to air emissions than 
commercial and industrial land uses. Residential 
neighborhoods border the Baker site to the sout
h and east. The nearest 
sensitive receptors to 
project components are residents on Palmwood, Wisteria, Oakville, and Marin located as close as 

100 feet from the construction zone of the Baker WTP and as close as 30 feet from the 

construction zone of the treated water pipelin
e, and residents on Fallenwood located as close as 
30 feet from the proposed sewer pipeline corridor
. However, pipeline construction would be 
constructed at a rate of approximately 50 to 
100 feet per day, limiting exposure to individual 
residents. Residents at this distance would not be
 exposed to substantial pollutant concentrations 
from project construction as described below.   
Carbon Monoxide 
The highest amount of CO produced by construction 
would be 44 lbs/day, which is 8 percent of 
the SCAQMD threshold of 550 lbs/day; therefor
e local construction CO concentrations are considered to be less-than-significant. Proposed project vehicle trips would also affect CO 
concentrations along the roadway network. Howe
ver, minimal employee trips would be required 
daily for routine operations, inspection and mainte
nance. Consequently, the proposed project™s 
operational contribution to local CO concentrations is considered to be less than significant, and no mitigation is required. 
Toxic Air Contaminants According to SCAQMD methodology, health effects from carcinogenic air toxics are usually 
described in terms of individual cancer risk. ﬁI
ndividual Cancer Riskﬂ is the likelihood that a 
person exposed to concentrations of toxic air emissions (TAC) over a 70-year lifetime will 

contract cancer, based on the use of standa
rd risk-assessment methodology. Given the 
construction schedule of 17 mont
hs, and estimated localized PM
2.5
 (DPM emissions from diesel 
engine exhaust is for the most part entirely co
mposed of PM2.5) emissions of 12 pounds per day 
(see Table 2), the proposed project would not r
esult in a long-term (i.e., 70 years) substantial 
source of TAC emissions. There would be no 
residual emissions after construction and no 
corresponding individual cancer risk as a result of project operation. No mitigation is required.  
Mitigation Measures
 None required.  Although not required, to minimi
ze potential effects to sensitive receptors during construction, Mitigation Measures AQ-1 through AQ-4 would 
implement best management practices to further decrease construction emissions.
 AQ-1: General contractors shall implement a fugitive dust control program pursuant to 
the provisions of SCAQMD Rule 403. 
 AQ-2: All construction equipment shall be prope
rly tuned and maintained in accordance 
with manufacturer™s specifications.

April 2011 
AQ-3: General contractors shall maintain and 
operate construction equipment so as to 
minimize exhaust emissions.  During construc
tion, trucks and vehicles in loading and 
unloading queues would turn their engines off when not in use to reduce vehicle 
emissions.  Construction emissions should be
 phased and scheduled to avoid emissions 
peaks and discontinued during second-stage smog alerts.
 AQ-4: All construction vehicles shall be prohibited from idling in excess of ten minutes, 
both on- and off-site.
 .   Odor Impacts According to the SCAQMD CEQA Air Quality 
Handbook, land uses associated with odor 
complaints typically include agricultural uses,
 wastewater treatment plants, food processing 
plants, chemical plants, composting, refineries,
 landfills, dairies, and fiberglass molding. The 
proposed project would not include the type of land uses typically associated with odor 
emissions. The site is currently a water filtrati
on plant; the proposed project would result in 
replacement water treatment facilities that woul
d not increase odor emissions in the project 
vicinity nor affect the nearest residential dwe
llings. Chemicals used during the treatment process 
would be stored in tanks and housed in the proposed chemical st
orage building. As described in 
Chapter 2, Project Description, the chemical 
building would have an HVAC system that would 
prevent potential release of chemical odors from the building. There would be no impact. 
Mitigation Measures
 None required. 
  Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Impact 3.3-4: The proposed project could conflict with implementation of state goals for 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and thereby h
ave a negative effect on Global Climate 
Change. (Less than Significant) The accumulation of GHGs has been implicated 
as a driving force for Global Climate Change. 
Definitions of climate change vary between a
nd across regulatory authorities and the scientific 
community, but in general can be described as 
the changing of the earth™s climate caused by 
natural fluctuations and the impa
ct of human activities that alter the composition of the global 
atmosphere. Both natural processes and human activities emit GHGs. Global Climate Change is a 

change in the average weather on earth that
 can be measured by wind patterns, storms, 
precipitation and temperature. Although there is 
disagreement as to the speed of global warming

April 2011 
and the extent of the impacts attributable to hum
an activities, the vast majority of the scientific 
community now agrees that there is a direct link between increased emission of GHGs and long 

term global temperature. Potential global warmi
ng impacts in California may include, but are not 
limited to, loss in snow pack, sea level rise, mo
re extreme heat days per year, more high ozone 
days, more large forest fires, and more drought 
years. Secondary effects are likely to include a 
global rise in sea level, impacts to agriculture, ch
anges in disease vectors, and changes in habitat 
and biodiversity. GHG impacts are considered to 
be exclusively cumulative impacts; there are no 
non-cumulative greenhouse gas emission impacts 
from a climate change perspective (CAPCOA, 
2008).  
On December 5, 2008, the SCAQMD Governing Bo
ard adopted the staff proposal for an interim 
GHG significance threshold for projects where th
e SCAQMD is the lead agency. The interim 
threshold consists of five tiers of standards that
 could result in a finding of less than significant 
impact.  The tiers include CEQA exemptions, 
consistency with regional GHG budgets, less than 
significant screening levels for industrial projects (10,000 metric tons/year CO2e) and 

commercial/residential projects (3,000 metric tons
/year CO2e), performance standards (i.e., 30 
percent less than Business As Usual [BAU]), and 
carbon offsets. The industrial screening level of 
10,000 metric tons/year CO2e was used as the 
quantitative threshold for the proposed project GHG emissions (SCAQMD, 2008). 
For the proposed project, the worst-case annual emissions associated with construction are 16 
metric tons per year CO2e after amortiza
tion over 30 years per SCAQMD methodology. 
Operational emissions would include an increase 
of approximately 26,700 mega-watt hours per 
year. CO2e emissions associated with this incr
eased energy use would be approximately 7,887 
metric tons per year CO2e. Appendix B includ
es these emissions calculations. Combined with 
amortized construction-related GHG emissions
 as recommended by SCAQMD, project operation 
would generate approximately 7,
903 metric tons CO2e per year. The proposed project would not 
exceed the SCAQMD draft screening significance thres
hold for industrial sources (10,000 metric 
tons/year CO2e). The GHG emissions associated with
 the proposed project would be considered 
to have a less-than-significant impact on the environment, based on the SCAQMD GHG 

significance threshold. Accordingly, the GHG emis
sions associated with the proposed project 
also would not hinder the State™s ability to me
et its AB 32 goals to reduce GHG emissions. Thus, 
the proposed project would not conflict with any 
applicable plan, policy or regulation adopted for 
the purpose of reducing GHG emissions. Impacts would be considered less than significant.  
In addition, the proposed Baker WTP would pr
ovide redundant treatment capacity to MWD™s 
Diemer Filtration Plant. Water treated at the Ba
ker WTP would be in place of, rather than in 
addition to, water treated at the Diemer Filtrati
on Plant. As such, to some extent, GHG emissions 
associated with operation of the proposed project 
would be in place of, rather than addition to, 
GHG emissions currently associated with operation of
 the Diemer Filtration Plant, to provide the 
same treated water to IRWD and the partner agenci
es. If the proposed project is not implemented, 
the Diemer Filtration Plant would continue to pr
ovide treated imported water to meet current and 
future demand. Currently, there are GHG emissions
 associated with energy use at the Diemer 
Filtration Plant. GHG emissions associated with operation the proposed Baker WTP potentially

would be offset by a reduction in GHG emissions from operation of the Diemer Filtration Plant, 
with respect to the treated water provided by 
MWD to IRWD and the partner agencies. As a 
result, GHG emissions associated with operation of the proposed project would have a less-than-
significant impact on the environment and Global Climate Change.

3.4 Biological Resources 
This section describes the environmental setti
ng for biological resources, the applicable regulatory framework, potential impacts of the 
proposed project, and mitigation measures to 
reduce those impacts to a level of less than significant.  

Methodology 
On March 17, 2009 and June 29, 2010, ESA
 biologists conducted a biological resource 
assessment to evaluate existing and potential biological resources that could be impacted from 

construction and operation of the proposed project 
(i.e., pump station, filtration plant, proposed 
pipeline alignments, and emergency overflow).  The assessment included an inventory of rare 
plants within and adjacent to the project™s area 
of disturbance; characterization of onsite and 
adjacent plant communities and determination of th
eir suitability to support special-status plants 
or animals; identification of jurisdictional resour
ces (e.g., ﬁwaters of the U.S.ﬂ and state protected 
waters), protected trees, or vegetation that coul
d potentially be impacted; and, the presence of any 
wildlife movement corridors.  
In addition to conducting the fi
eld assessment, ESA reviewed existing information to identify 
target species and habitats that have been previous
ly recorded in the vicinity of the project site.  
The database search included the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) (CDFG, 

2010), the California Native Plant Society Electronic Inventory (CNPS, 2010), and the U.S. Fish 

and Wildlife Service endangered species list 
(USFWS, 2010). ESA queried these sources for 
special-status species records in 
the Lake Forest U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute quadrangle 
and the eight surrounding quadrangles (Orange, Tu
stin, Black Star Canyon, Corona South, 
Santiago Peak, Canada Gobernadora, San Juan Capistrano, and Laguna Beach).  The potential for 
special-status species to occur on the project site
 was evaluated based on the proximity of the 
project to previously recorded occurrences in 
the CNDDB, on-site vegetation and habitat quality, 
topography, elevation, soils, surrounding land uses,
 habitat preferences, and geographic ranges of special-status plant and wildlife species known to occu
r in the region. Appended to this EIR is a 
Biological Resources Assessment (ESA, 2010) that details the methods and results of the 

biological resource assessment summarized above (See 
Appendix C).   Regional Setting The proposed project is located in the Saddleback
 Valley region of Orange County, California. 
The climate in this region can be characterized
 as Mediterranean, with an average high and low 
temperature of 75.4° F and 49.4° F, respectively. Annual precipitation averages 12.86", with 

10.74" accumulating from November to March. Elevation in the project area ranges from 

approximately 630 feet at the Treated Water Conn
ection Point Option 1 to approximately 475 feet 
at Serrano Creek.  3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

The project area lies within the Newport Bay Wa
tershed and Santa Ana River Watershed. The 
Newport Bay Watershed drains a
pproximately 152.02 square miles 
of southern Orange County to 
the Pacific Ocean. Serrano Creek and other drainag
es in the project area are part of the San Diego 
Creek/Peters Canyon Wash subwatershed, which is
 the largest subwatershed in the Newport Bay 
watershed and collectively drains into the nor
theastern end of Upper Newport Bay.  Santiago 
Creek and other drainages in the project area are 
part of the Santa Ana River Watershed, which 
covers 2,800 square miles and discharges to th
e Pacific Ocean in Newport Beach, north of 
Newport Bay. 
Local Setting  
Baker WTP 
The majority of the existing Baker Filtration Plan
t (BFP) consists of water treatment structures, 
pavement, and ornamental landscaping. The Ba
ker site is accessed through a residential 
neighborhood to the west and is surrounded by 
urban development with the exception of Serrano 
Creek, which borders the site to the west. The area north of the Baker site is largely vacant land 
and is located within Non-Reserve Lands in th
e Central Subarea of the Orange County Natural 
Communities Conservation Program (NCCP).  
Treated Water Pipeline Alternatives 
The proposed pipeline alignments run through the existing Baker site, as well as adjacent urban 
developments consisting of paved roads, or
namental landscaping, and varying amounts of 
disturbed native and non-native vegetation.   
OC-33 Meter Exchange 
The pipeline replacement would occur outside of 
the OC-33 meter vault. The existing pipeline 
would be replaced with approximately 30 linear feet of steel pipeline. The area to be affected 

during installation of the pipeline is entir
ely disturbed and devoid of vegetation.  
Raw Water Pump Station 
The site for the proposed Raw Water Pump Sta
tion is bordered by Jamboree Road to the east, 
Peters Canyon Reservoir to the west, willow ripa
rian woodland to the north, and coastal sage 
scrub vegetation to the south.  The existing Intertie
 facility is fenced in, mostly paved or barren 
ground that is devoid of vegetation.  
Sewer Pipeline and Emergency Overflow Facility 
The proposed sewer pipeline would be construc
ted within an easement along the existing Serrano 
Creek Trail that extends along the northern boun
dary of Serrano Creek.  This portion of the 
Serrano Creek Trail is bordered to the north by r
esidential neighborhoods and is an actively used 
pedestrian trail. The proposed emergency overflow
 facility would discharge into Serrano Creek.  
The portion of Serrano Creek where the emergenc
y outflow is proposed is undisturbed and 
consists mostly of riparian woodland.

Plant Communities and Habitat Types  
Plant communities are assemblages of plant species th
at occur together in the same area. They are 
defined by species composition and relative 
abundance. ESA mapped 
vegetation communities within and surrounding the project area for the Baker site (
Figure 3.4-1) according to the California Department of Fish and Game™s 
List of California Terrestrial Natural Communities 
(CDFG 2003).  Common plant names are taken from J.C. Hickman (1993). Provided below is a 

brief description of the existing plant communities and habitats found within the primary 
components of the proposed project.  
Baker WTP 
Proposed disturbance areas within the Baker site 
would occur primarily within already disturbed 
areas that consist of ruderal vegetation and orna
mental landscaped areas.  Several native plant 
species occur within the plant site including numerous coast live oak (
Quercus agrifolia) trees 
and approximately 4.2 acres of moderately distur
bed coastal sage scrub (CSS). Dominant plants 
observed within this CSS community include: buckwheat (
Eriogonum fasiculatum
), coast goldenbush (
Encelia californica), black sage (Salvia melifera), mulefat (
Baccharis salicifolia), elderberry (
Sambucus mexicana
) black mustard (
Brassica nigra), brome grasses (
Bromus sp.), and wild oat (Avena fatua). Treated Water Pipeline Alternatives 
Two alternatives were evaluated for construction 
of a treated water pipeline between the Baker 
WTP and SCP. This pipeline woul
d be constructed only if a direct connection to the AMP is not 
feasible. As shown on Figure 3.4-1, the pipe
line alternatives initially follow the same path, 
northwest from the Baker facility through orna
mental landscaping that borders an adjacent 
residential complex. At approximately halfway along the route, Option 2 turns to the west 

continuing through the landscaping while Option 1 continues northwest and crosses 

approximately 1400 feet of disturbed CSS. Dominant plant species observed in the CSS area 

include buckwheat, black sage, coast goldenbush, and elderberry. In addition, there is an area 
within the CSS (as depicted on Figure 3.4-1) that
 contains a small area of coastal prickly pear 
(Opuntia littoralis
) succulent scrub, which is also somewhat disturbed from existing trails and 
recreational use. 
OC-33 Meter Exchange 
The proposed 10 foot section of OC-33 pipeline to
 be retrofitted is located in a previously 
disturbed area devoid of vegetation and ground dist
urbance from work activities will be limited to 
this segment of pipeline to be upsized. 
 Raw Water Pump Station 
Proposed construction within the Raw Water Pump 
Station would be contained within a fenced, 
previously graded and/or paved area that cons
ists of existing IRWD facilities. The surrounding 
area consists of native habitat 
with varying degrees of disturba
nce. These habitats include CSS (immediately adjacent) and a willow riparian area down slope near the Peters Canyon Reservoir 

(approximately 300 feet to the west). Dominant
 plant species observed around the existing fenced

facility include mulefat, coyote bush (
Baccharis pilularis
), California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), buckwheat, black sage, coast goldenbush, 
and elderberry. Within the existing facility 
there are several mature Brazilian pepper and eu
calyptus trees, as well as ornamental landscaping 
and some CSS plants (i.e., mostly California buckwheat). 
Sewer Pipeline 
Construction of the proposed sewer pipeline woul
d occur through trench installation within an 
existing 15-foot-wide utility easement that runs 
along Serrano Creek Trail. An additional 15-foot-
wide temporary construction easement adjacent to 
and north of the utility easement may also be 
utilized. If this feature is necessary to construct,
 the sewer pipeline would extend approximately 
1100 feet into disturbed CSS located to the east
 of the Baker site (Figure 3.4-1). The Serrano 
Creek Trail consists of a compacted dirt pedest
rian path that is bordered to the north with 
landscaped, manufactured slope with mature sycamore (
Platanus racemosa
) and ornamental ground cover. The south side of the trail is co
mprised of a mix of native and non-native ruderal 
vegetation, including black mustard (
Brassica nigra), tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca
), shortpod 
mustard (
Hirschfeldia incana),  Russian thistle (
Salsola kali), storksbill filaree (
Erodium sp.), fennel (foeniculum vulgare), bull thistle (
Cirsium vulgare), telegraph weed (Heterotheca 
grandiflora
), sea fig (
Carpobrotus chilensis
), mule fat, calabazilla (
Cucurbita foetidissima), toyon 
(Heteromeles arbutifolia
), coyote bush, buckwheat, Peruvian pepper (
Schinus molle), common 
reed (Phragmites australis), Canary Island palm (
Phoenix canariensis), prickly pear (
Opuntia sp.), and horehound (
Marrubium vulgare
). Stands of elderberry and two immature coast live oak 
trees are also located outside of the easeme
nt along the south side of the trail. Emergency Overflow Facility 
The portion of Serrano Creek where a proposed emergency overflow may occur is an 
approximately one half mile reach of the creek s
outh of the existing BFP. This portion of Serrano 
Creek is characterized as Southern Sycamore
 Alder Riparian Woodland (Holland, 1986); a 
California Department of Fish and Game (CDF
G) Sensitive Plant Community.  This community 
has a dominant overstory of arroyo willow (
Salix lasiolepis), sycamore (
Platanus racemosa
), and blue elderberry (Sambucus Mexicana
). Other overstory species include red willow (
Salix laevigata), poplar (poplar sp.
), coast live oak, and eucalyptus. Common understory species 
include, mulefat, toyon, common reed, and coyo
te bush. At the emergency overflow site in 
Serrano Creek, prickly pear and coasal 
sage scrub also have been observed (
Figure 3.4-2) (RBF, 2010).  
General Wildlife Common wildlife expected to be in the project 
area, mainly within Serrano Creek, include species 
that are adapted to urban environments such as opossum (
Didelphis virginiana), raccoon 
(Procyon lotor
), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis
), coyote (Canis latrans
), common rodents, 
western fence lizard (
Sceloporus occidentalis), side blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana
), and various passerine species typical of the area (e.g., 
finches, sparrows, crow, and raptors). Wildlife 
species observed within and in the vicinity 
of Serrano Creek included the following avian

species: American goldfinch (
Carduelis tristis
), house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus
), common 
raven (Corvus corax), and spotted towhee (
Pipilo maculatus). Although no raptors or nests were 
observed during a reconnaissance-level assessment, 
some of the larger eucalyptus and coast live 
oak trees within the riparian area could provide ra
ptor nesting habitat. Few wildlife species would 
be anticipated within the proposed work areas.   
Wildlife Movement Corridors Wildlife movement corridors provide a connection between two or more habitat areas that are 
often larger or superior in quality to the linkage. 
Such linkages can be quite small or constricted, 
but can be vital to the long-term health of c
onnected habitats. Linkage values are often addressed 
in terms of ﬁgene flowﬂ between populations, with movement taking potentially many 
generations. The U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, has defined wildlife corridors as 

ﬁ–avenues along which wide-ranging animals can
 travel, plants can propagate, genetic 
interchange can occur, populations can move in
 response to environmental changes and natural 
disasters, and threatened species can 
be replenished from other areas.ﬂ  
Wildlife movement is highly restricted at the Ba
ker site due to the existing urban development 
that surrounds the project area, which includes residential neighborhoods, commercial and 

industrial development, freeways, and highly trav
eled roads. Nonetheless,
 some animals adapted 
to urban conditions are expected to traverse through Serrano Creek from the north, which may 

include coyote, skunk, opossum, and raccoon.  
However, passage through Serrano Creek to the 
south is terminated at the Bake Parkway urba
n development.  Based on aerial photographs and 
review of the USGS Quadrangle for Lake For
est, Serrano Creek runs underground at Bake 
Parkway and does not resurface downstream. 
To the north, Serrano Creek bisects urban 
development and traverses underneath Highway 241
, extending further north to Whiting Ranch 
and Santiago Canyon which makes up the headwaters
 of the creek.  In summary, animals are not 
expected to traverse through the proposed project 
site and the project site is not considered a 
wildlife migration corridor. 
Sensitive Natural Communities The area of Serrano Creek where an emergency overfl
ow area is to be located is characterized as 
Southern Sycamore Alder Riparian Woodland; 
a CDFG-listed sensitive terrestrial community.  
No other sensitive natural communities occur within the project area. Habitat Conservation Plans  
Orange County Natural Community Conservation Plan/Habitat Conservation Plan  
The Orange County Natural Community Conservation Plan/Habitat Conservation Plan 
(NCCP/HCP), of which IRWD is a signatory, sets forth a proposed Conservation Strategy that 

would be implemented by the County of Orange 
in cooperation with state and federal agencies 
and Participating Landowners in Orange County. The proposed Conservation Strategy focuses on

April 2011 
long-term protection and management of multip
le natural communities that provide habitat 
essential to the survival of a broad a
rray of wildlife and plant species.  
The Baker WTP, treated water pipelines, and 
sewer pipelines would be constructed in areas designated as Non-Reserve Lands in the NCCP/H
CP.  Construction of the proposed Baker WTP 
and pipelines would not be in conflict with the NCCP/HCP.  
Although the proposed Raw Water Pump Station w
ould be located within Reserve Lands of the 
NCCP/HCP, demolition of existing structures a
nd construction of new facilities would occur 
entirely within the (disturbed) boundaries of the existing site. The site does not support any 

habitat capable of supporting any candidate, 
sensitive or special-status species; therefore construction at the Raw Water Pump Station woul
d not be in conflict with the Orange County 
NCCP/HCP. Special-Status Species 
Special-status species are those plants and animal
s that, because of their recognized rarity or 
vulnerability to various causes of habitat loss or 
population decline, are recognized by federal, 
state, or other agencies as under threat from 
human-associated developments. Some of these 
species receive specific protection that is defined by federal or state endangered species 

legislation. Others have been designated as ﬁsensitiveﬂ on the basis of adopted policies and 
expertise of state resource agencies or organiza
tions with acknowledged expertise, or policies adopted by local governmental agencies such as counties, cities, and 
special districts to meet local conservation objectives. These species are referred to
 collectively as "special-status species" in 
this report, following a convention that has developed in practice but has no official sanction. 

Special-status species include: 
 Species listed or proposed for listing as threat
ened or endangered, or are candidates for possible future listing as threatened or enda
ngered, under the federal Endangered Species 
Act or the California Endangered Species Act; 
 Species that meet the definitions of 
rare or endangered under the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (
CEQA Guidelines Section 15380); 
 Plants listed as rare under the California Native Plant Protection Act (CDFG Code 1900 
et seq.);   Plants considered by the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) to be rare, threatened, or 
endangered (List 1B and 2 plants) in 
California (Skinner and Palvik, 2004); 
 Plants listed by the CNPS as plants in which 
more information is needed to determine 
their status and plants of limited 
distribution (List 3 and 4 plants)  
(Skinner and Palvik, 2004); 
 Wildlife species of special concern to CDFG; and/or 
 Wildlife fully protected in California (CDFG Code Sections 3511, 4700, and 5050).
 A CNDDB search (CDFG, 2010) revealed the reco
rded occurrences of 13 special status plant species within a five mile radius of the pr
oject area. These species are listed below in 
Table 3.4-1. Three of the rare plant species found to have near
by records of occurrence are listed as endangered

Federal Endangered Species Act 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) administers the federal Endangered Species Act 
(FESA) that provides a process for listing species 
as either threatened or endangered, and 
methods of protecting listed species. Species are 
listed as either endangered or threatened under 
Section 4 of the FESA that defines as ﬁendangeredﬂ 
any plant or animal species that is in danger 
of extinction throughout all or a significant portio
n of its range and ﬁthreatenedﬂ if a species is 
likely to become endangered in the foreseeable fu
ture. Section 9 of the FESA prohibits ﬁtakeﬂ of 
listed threatened or endangered species. The te
rm ﬁtakeﬂ means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, 
shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to
 attempt to engage in such conduct. Harm under 
the definition of ﬁtakeﬂ includes disturbance or 
loss of habitats used by a threatened or 
endangered species during any portion of its life hi
story. Under the regulations of the FESA, the 
USFWS may authorize ﬁtakeﬂ when it is incidental 
to, but not the purpose of, an otherwise lawful 
act.  Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (16 U.S.C. 703-711) makes it unlawful to possess, buy, 

sell, purchase, barter or ﬁtakeﬂ any migratory bird
 listed in Title 50 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 10. ﬁTakeﬂ is defined as possession 
or destruction of migratory birds, their nests 
or eggs. Disturbances that cause nest abandonment a

habitats upon which these birds depend may be a vi
olation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  
Clean Water Act Section 404 
Wetlands are generally considered to be areas that
 are periodically or permanently inundated by 
surface or ground water, and support vegetation adapted to life in saturated soil. Wetlands are 
recognized as important features on a regional and na
tional level due to their high inherent value 
to fish and wildlife, use as storage areas for stor
m and floodwaters, and water recharge, filtration, 
and purification functions. Technical standards fo
r delineating wetlands ha
ve been developed by 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps
) which generally define wetlands through 
consideration of three criteria: hydrology, soils
, and vegetation. Under Section 404 of the Clean 
Water Act (CWA), the Corps is responsible for regulating the discharge of dredged or fill 
material into waters of the United States. Th
e term ﬁwatersﬂ includes wetlands and non-wetland 
bodies of water that meet specific criteria as de
fined in the Code of Federal Regulations.  
State California Endangered Species Act 
Under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA)
, the CDFG is responsible for maintaining a 
list of threatened and endangered species (Ca
lifornia Fish and Game Code 2070), candidate 3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

species, and species of special concern. Pursua
nt to the requirements of CESA, an agency 
reviewing a proposed project within its jurisd
iction must determine whether any state listed 
endangered or threatened species may be present 
on the project region and determine whether the 
proposed project would have a potentially significant impact on such species. In addition, the 

CDFG encourages informal consultation on any pr
oposed project that may impact a candidate 
species. If there were project-related impacts to
 species on the CESA threatened and endangered 
list, they would be considered ﬁsignificant.ﬂ Impa
cts to ﬁspecies of concernﬂ would be considered 
ﬁsignificantﬂ under certain circumstances, discussed below. 
Although threatened and endangered species are prot
ected by specific federal and state statutes, 
CEQA Guidelines Section 15380(b) provides that a species not listed on the federal or state list of 
protected species may be considered rare or e
ndangered if the species can be shown to meet 
certain specified criteria. These criteria have b
een modeled after the definition in FESA and the 
section of the California Fish and Game Code deali
ng with rare or endangere
d plants or animals. 
This section was included in the CEQA Guidelines primarily to deal with situations in which a 
public agency is reviewing a project that may have a significant effect on, for example, a 

candidate species that has not yet been list
ed by either the USFWS or CDFG. Thus, CEQA 
provides an agency with the ability to protect a 
species from a project™s potential impacts until the 
respective government agencies have an opportunity to designate the species as protected, if 

warranted. 
California Department of Fish and Game Code 
Fully-Protected Species 
The California Fish and Game Code provides protection from ﬁtakeﬂ for a variety of species that 

possess ﬁfully-protected speciesﬂ status. Fully prot
ected species may not be taken or possessed at 
any time and no licenses or permits may be issu
ed for their take except for collecting these species for necessary scientific research or relocation.  
Bird and Nest Protection 
Section 3503 of the California Fish and Game 
Code prohibits the killing of birds or the 
destruction of bird nests. Birds of prey are prot
ected in California under the State Fish and Game Code, Section 3503.5 (1992). Section 3503.5 states that it is ﬁunlawful to take, possess, or destroy 
any birds in the order Falconiformes or Strigiformes 
(birds of prey) or to take, possess, or destroy 
the nest or eggs of any such bird except as ot
herwise provided by this code or any regulation 
adopted pursuant thereto.ﬂ Project impacts to 
these species would not be considered ﬁsignificantﬂ 
in this EIR unless they are known or have a high potential to nest on the site or rely on it for 

primary foraging. 
Wetland Regulations  
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

U.S.ﬂ and receive protection under Section 404 of
 the Clean Water Act (CWA). The U.S. Army

April 2011 
Corps of Engineers (USACE) has primary federal 
responsibility for administering regulations that 
concern waters and wetlands on the project 
site under statutory authority of the CWA 
(Section 404). In addition, the regulations and policies of various federal agencies (e.g., U.S. 

Department of Agriculture and Natural Resource Conservation Service [NRCS], and the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency) mandate that the filling of wetlands be avoided to the extent 

feasible. The USACE requires obtaining a permit if a project proposes placing structures within 

navigable waters and/or alteration of waters of the United States. 
The term ﬁwaters of the United Statesﬂ as defined in the Code of Federal Regulations 
(33 CFR 328.3[a] and [b]; 40 CFR 230.3[s]) include
s those areas that are inundated or saturated 
by surface or ground water at a frequency and 
duration sufficient to support, and that under 
normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated 

soil conditions. In extant regulations, these may be 
taken to be sloughs, wet meadows, or natural 
ponds; however, the Supreme Court of the United 
States recently ruled (January 8, 2001: 
Solid 
Waste Agency of Northwestern Cook County (SWANCC) v. United State Army Corps of Engineers et al.) that certain isolated wetlands do not fall under the jurisdiction of the CWA. 
Based on the Supreme Court ruling (SWANCC), non-nav
igable, isolated, intrastate waters are no 
longer defined as waters of the United States. Ju
risdiction of non-navigable,
 isolated, intrastate 
waters may be possible if their use, degradation, 
or destruction could affe
ct other waters of the 
Unites States, or interstate or 
foreign commerce. Jurisdiction over su
ch other waters is analyzed on 
a case-by-case basis. Impoundment
s of waters, tributaries of wate
rs, and wetlands adjacent to 
waters should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. 
A more recent Supreme Court case, 
Rapanos v. United States 
(2006), also questioned the definition 
of ﬁwaters of the United Statesﬂ and the scope of federal regulatory jurisdiction over such waters, 

but left open the question as to whether the CWA ex
tends to those waters and wetlands that have a 
ﬁsignificant nexusﬂ to navigable wate
rs of the United States, or whether it is limited to waters with a 
continuous connection. The implica
tions of this ruling are still be
ing tested in the courts. For 
example, the California Ninth Circu
it Court of Appeals decision, in 
Northern California River 
Watch v. City of Healdsburg
 (August 10, 2006), relied on the ﬁs
ignificant nexusﬂ definition, an 
interpretation that suggests little change in the 
scope of the CWA. To date, neither the USEPA nor 
the USACE have issued guidelines as to how to im
plement the CWA in light of these latest rulings. 
In practice, USACE jurisdictional au
thority remains as it was prior to 
Rapanos, although the 
potential exists for changes in the future based 
on Court decisions and pending regulatory guidance.

applicable state and federal wildlife regulation. Where significant impacts are identified, the City 
will require modifications to the project to avoid the impact, or require mitigation measures to 

reduce the impact. The focus of the impact
 assessment includes the following resources: 
 Riparian and wetland habitat;   Coastal sage scrub habitat;  
 Rare and endangered plant and animal species;  
 Wildlife movement corridors;  
 Habitat fragmentation; and  
 Significant tree stands.

Significance Criteria 
The criteria used to determine the significance of
 impacts related to aesthetic resources are based 
on Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines. The proposed project would result in a significant 
impact if it would: 
 Have a substantial adverse effect, either dir
ectly or through habitat modifications, on any 
species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or
 special-status species in local or regional 
plans, policies, or regulations, or by the CDFG or USFWS; 
 Have a substantial adverse effect on any ri
parian habitat or other sensitive natural 
community identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations, or by the CDFG or 

USFWS;  Have a substantial adverse effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 
404 of the Clean Water Act (including, but not limited to, marsh, vernal pool, coastal, 

etc.) through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means; 
 Interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or 
wildlife species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or 

impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites; 
 Conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources, such as a 
tree preservation policy or ordinance; or 
 Conflict with the provisions of an adopted 
habitat conservation plan, natural community 
conservation plan, or other approved local, re
gional, or state habitat conservation plan. 
Impacts Discussion 
The following sections discuss the potential effects of the proposed project to biological resources 
according to the key issue areas identified in Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines
 and corresponding to the significance criteria identified above. 
Wildlife Movement Corridors 
Wildlife movement is highly restricted at the Ba
ker site due to the existing urban development 
that surrounds the project area, which includes residential neighborhoods, commercial and 

industrial development, freeways, and highly travel
ed roads.  Nonetheless,
 some animals adapted 
to urban conditions are expected to traverse through Serrano Creek from the north, which may 

include coyote, skunk, opossum, and raccoon.  
However, passage through Serrano Creek to the 
south is terminated at Bake Parkway urban 
development.  Based on aerial photographs and 
review of the USGS Quadrangle for Lake For
est, Serrano Creek runs underground at Bake 
Parkway and does not resurface downstream.  
To the north, Serrano Creek bisects urban 
development and traverses underneath Highway 241
, extending further north to Whiting Ranch 
and Santiago Canyon which makes up the headwaters
 of the creek.  In summary, animals are not

April 2011 
expected to traverse through the proposed project 
site and the project site is not considered a 
wildlife migration corridor. There would be no impact. 
HCP/NCCP 
The proposed project would be constructed in areas designated as Non-Reserve Lands in the 
NCCP/HCP. Serrano Creek and the riparian woodlan
d it supports is also within Non-Reserve 
Land. Although the proposed Raw Water Pump Sta
tion would be located within Reserve Lands 
of the NCCP/HCP, construction of new facilities 
at the existing Intertie would occur entirely 
within the boundaries of the existing site, which 
are entirely disturbed and no disturbance would 
occur outside of previously disturbed areas. Moreover, the site does not support any habitat 
capable of supporting any candidate, sensitive or sp
ecial-status species; therefore construction of 
the Raw Water Pump Station would not be in
 conflict with the Orange County NCCP/HCP. 
Construction and operation of the entire proposed 
project would not be in conflict with the 
NCCP/HCP; therefore, no impacts would occur. 
Special Status Species 
Impact 3.4-1: Implementation of the propo
sed project could have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modi
fications, on any species identified as a 
candidate, sensitive, or special-status species 
in local or regional plans, policies, or 
regulations, or by the CDFG or USFWS. (Less than Significant with Mitigation) 
The proposed project would be constructed pr
imarily within the boundaries of previously 
developed sites (i.e. Baker site, Raw Water Pump 
Station site, and OC-33 site) where no habitats 
are present to support potentially occurring special-s
tatus species. As depicted in Figure 3.4-1, 
Option 1 for the proposed treated water pipeline would extend for approximately 1,400 feet 

through disturbed coastal sage scrub (CSS), a pl
ant community common to southern California 
that is known to support several special-status 
species. Option 2 for the proposed treated water 
pipeline would extend through landscaped areas ad
jacent to residential development and CSS habitat (see Figure 3.4-1); no special-status speci
es or other sensitive biological resources would 
occur within these landscaped areas. The CSS 
habitat adjacent to the proposed pipeline 
alignments are relatively disturbed by several di
rt paths actively used for off-road bicycles and 
hikers (several bikers and hikers were observe
d within these coastal sage scrub habitats during the 
biological assessment conducted by ESA). In add
ition, the CSS habitat is located immediately 
adjacent to a high density residential devel
opment. Nearby occurre
nce records (CNDDB, 2010) for special-status species known to occur with
in the CSS plant community include coastal 
California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica
), a federally-listed threatened species, 
and the following CDFG Species of Special Concern: coastal cactus wren (
Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus sandiegensis
), orange throated whiptail (
Aspidoscelis hyperythrya
), coast patch-nosed snake (Salvadora hexalepis
), and coast (San Diego) horned lizard (
Phrynosoma coronatum 
coronatum). Approximately 0.7 acres of CSS and 0.33 acres of 
coastal prickly pear succulent scrub would be 
directly impacted if pipeline Option 1 is implem
ented. Due to the disturbed condition of the CSS 
3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

and its proximity to highly urbanized areas (i.e
., roads and adjacent residential neighborhoods), 
coastal California gnatcatchers and the coastal cact
us wren are not expected to occur. However, 
the special-status terrestrial species listed a
bove have a low potential to be present. 
Implementation of Mitigation Measu
re BIO-1 and BIO-2 would ensure impacts to special-status 
terrestrial species are reduced to less than signi
ficant levels. Pipeline Option 2 would not directly 
impact CSS habitat and no special-status species 
would occur within the landscaped areas located 
along the Option 2 alignment. 
Serrano Creek, although once considered an ephe
meral stream channel, has been described as 
having a small amount of base flow most of the time due to its proximity to development 

(SCCWRP 2005). This base flow was observed by ESA during a 2009 site assessment and was 

assumed to be from runoff from nearby residential developments. The creek does not support 

perennial natural flows. Due to the absence of perennial natural flows, the portion of the creek 
located near the project site is not considered
 a habitat that could potentially support aquatic 
special-status reptile species such as southwestern pond turtle and two-striped garter snake, and 
special status fish species. The Southern Syca
more Alder Riparian Woodland in Serrano Creek 
could, however, support potential foraging habitat for least Bell™s Vireo (
Vireo bellii pusilus), 
although breeding activity is not expected to occu
r in this area. In addition, there™s moderate 
potential that long-eared owl (
Asio otus) could forage and nest within the creek. Implementation 
of Mitigation Measure BIO-3 and BIO-4 would ensure that any impacts to least Bell™s vireo and 

long-eared owl as a result of construction activities in the vicinity of the riparian habitat would be 
reduced to levels that are less than significant.  One raptor nest was observed within a blue gum (
Eucalyptus globulus
) tree located at the western 
boundary of the existing Baker site. Some of the la
rger eucalyptus trees within and in the vicinity 
of Serrano Creek could also serve as raptor nest
 sites; although, none were observed during the 
sites visits conducted by ESA in 2009 and 2010.
 Although not observed, several song birds are 
expected to nest within the trees and shrubs located throughout the Baker site, as well as in the 
vegetation within and adjacent to the proposed 
treated water pipeline alignments, Raw Water 
Pump Station, OC-33 site, and Serrano Creek. Mitig
ation measures to reduce impacts to breeding 
and nesting birds to a level of less than significant are provided below in Mitigation Measures BIO-3 and BIO-4. Mitigation Measures 
BIO-1: If Option 1 of the treated water pipeline is implemented, to avoid potential 
impacts to terrestrial special-status sp
ecies, the following measure shall apply:  
 IRWD shall retain a qualified biologist w
ith a CDFG Scientific Collection Permit and Memorandum of Unders
tanding to conduct preconstruction surveys for the 
California Species of Special Concern that 
have the potential to occur within the 
project impact area. These wildlife species in
clude orange throated whiptail, coast 
(San Diego) horned lizard, and coast patch-nose snake. All special-status wildlife 

species observed within the project site 
during preconstruction surveys shall be 
relocated, at the approval of CDFG, to an approved site with suitable habitat for these species. Surveys and relocation of w
ildlife may occur prior to construction; 
however, focused surveys must 
occur within 30 days prior to construction to ensure 
3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

that no special-status wildlife is present with
in the project site during construction. Survey and relocation methods sha
ll be approved by CDFG prior to 
commencement of grading. 
BIO-2: For Option 1 of the treated water pipeline,
 exclusionary fencing (i.e., silt fencing) 
shall be installed around the perimeter of th
e construction area where native vegetation is present, or where suitable habitat for special-status (terrestrial) species is present, as 
determined by a qualified biologist. The excl
usionary fencing shall be backfilled (or buried) at the base of the fence to excl
ude reptiles from entering the work area. 
Installation of exclusionary fencing shall be 
verified by a qualified biologist prior to the 
commencement of construction or ground disturbing activities. 
BIO-3: A preconstruction nest survey shall be 
conducted if construction and/or ground 
disturbing activities will commence between 
February 15 and August 15.  To avoid 
impacts to native nesting birds, including
 coastal cactus wren, coastal California 
gnatcatcher, and least Bell™s vireo, IRWD and/
or its contractors shall retain a qualified biologist to conduct breeding bird surveys in 
potential nesting habitat within and adjacent 
to all project sites prior to construction or 
site preparation activities. Potential nesting habitat may include grassy and weedy areas, as 
well as shrubs and trees. Suitable nesting 
habitat in the vicinity of proposed disturban
ce areas shall be determined by the qualified 
biologist. The qualified biologist shall conduct 
a nest survey within five days of ground 
disturbance activities associated with construc
tion, (such as site clearing, grading, or 
excavation) to determine if active nests of 
bird species protected by the Migratory Bird 
Treaty Act (MBTA) or the California Fish and Game Code are present in the construction 

zone or within a distance determined 
by CDFG or the qualified biologist.   
If ground disturbance activities are delayed, 
additional pre-construction surveys will be 
conducted such that no more than five days w
ill have elapsed between the last survey and 
the commencement of ground disturbance activ
ities. Surveys shall include examination 
of trees, shrubs, and the ground within grassla
nd for nesting birds, as several bird species 
known to occur in the area are shrub or ground nesters. 
BIO-4: If active nests are found during surveys 
conducted in accordance with Mitigation Measure BIO-3, then the qualified biolog
ist shall determine whether construction 
activities have the potential to disturb the n
est(s) and determine appropriate construction 
limitations, which may include but are not lim
ited to erection of sound barriers, full-time 
monitoring by a qualified biologist, or estab
lishment of no-construction buffers (usually 
300 ft for nesting song birds and 500 ft for nesting raptors and special-status bird 

species). In addition, the qualified biologist shall serve as a construction monitor during 
those periods when construction activities will 
occur near active nest areas to ensure no inadvertent impacts to the nest occur. If n
ecessary, limits of cons
truction to avoid an active nest shall be established in the field w
ith flagging, fencing, or other appropriate 
barriers; and construction pers
onnel shall be instructed on the sensitivity of nest areas.  
The results of the survey, and any avoidance 
measures taken, shall be submitted to IRWD 
within 30 days of completion of the pre-cons
truction surveys and construction monitoring 
to document compliance with applicable st
ate and federal laws pertaining to the 
protection of native birds.  
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.   3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

Riparian Habitat, Natural Communities, Wetlands 
Impact 3.4-2: Implementation of the propo
sed project could have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community identified in local or 
regional plans, policies, regulations, or by the CDFG or USFWS. (Less than Significant with 
Mitigation) 
Construction of proposed Baker WTP and the Ra
w Water Pump Station would be within the 
boundaries of the previously developed sites. No 
riparian or other sensitive habitats are located within these sites. Approximately 0.7 acres of
 CSS and 0.33 acres of coastal prickly pear 
succulent scrub would be directly impacted if pi
peline Option 1 is implemented. This would be 
considered a potentially significant impact. According 
to the City of Lake Forest™s General Plan Œ 
Recreation Element, the City will require modifications to the project to avoid the impact, or 

require mitigation measures to reduce the imp
act to these plant communities if impacts are 
determined to be significant. Implementation of
 Mitigation Measure BIO-5 would reduce impacts 
to these native plant communities to less-than-significant levels. No other sensitive natural communities occur along the pipeline routes, 
which includes the proposed sewer line. 
Serrano Creek is located immediately to the s
outh of the proposed Baker WTP. During the 
reconnaissance survey, several runoff drains were
 observed on the existing facility site which 
appear to drain directly into Serrano Creek. Drai
nage into Serrano Creek is assumed, because the 
Baker site slopes to the south towards the Cr
eek. Implementation of Mitigation Measure BIO-6 
would reduce potential runoff impacts to Serra
no Creek during construction of the proposed 
treatment plant to less than significant levels.  
The habitat of Serrano Creek where the emerge
ncy overflow facility would be located is 
characterized as Southern Sycamore Alder Riparian Woodland; a CDFG-listed sensitive 

terrestrial community. The proposed discharge st
ructure and downstream rip rap would have a 
footprint of approximately 52 ft by 45 ft with
in the creek bed and surrounding riparian habitat. 
Construction and operation of the overflow dischar
ge structure could potentially result in some 
permanent loss of Southern Sycamore Alder Ripa
rian Woodland. Implementation of Mitigation 
Measure BIO-7 would reduce impacts to sensitive ri
parian habitat to less than significant levels. Temporary emergency overflow events into th
e creekbed would not result in any significant 
impacts to this sensitive natural 
community; however, small levels 
of sedimentation, siltation, or 
erosion could occur. Design of the discharge stru
cture includes approximately 42 feet of rip-rap 
to dissipate flow and prevent erosion, siltation, 
and sedimentation in the creek. Impacts associated 
with operation of the emergency overflow w
ould be considered less than significant. Mitigation Measures 
BIO-5: If Option 1 of the treated water pipeline is implemented, then coastal sage scrub 
and coastal prickly pear succulent scrub communities that are disturbed by construction 

shall be restored at the same location wher
e impacts occur on a 1:1 ratio following the 
completion of construction activities. If coastal 
sage scrub or coastal prickly pear succulent 
scrub would be removed for construction purposes,
 a restoration plan shall be completed 
that specifies, at a minimum, the following: (1
) the location of replacement sites; (2) the 
3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

quantity and species of plants to be planted; (3) a schedule and action plan to maintain and 
monitor the re-vegetation area; (4) a list of 
criteria and performance standards by which to 
measure success of the planting sites; (5) meas
ures to exclude unauthorized entry into the 
re-vegetation/enhancement areas; and (6) conti
ngency measures in the event that mitigation 
efforts are not successful. This restoration plan
 shall be completed prior to construction of 
the proposed project. Restoration activities, whether onsite or offsite, shall reuse vegetative 
material from the site of disturbance to the extent feasible.  
BIO-6: IRWD shall require construction contractors to implement the following measures 
during construction of the Baker WTP and the sewer pipeline
:  The construction contractor shall install 
temporary erosion control measures around 
drains to reduce localized impacts to Serrano Creek in the area of the project and 

protect onsite drainages from excess sedim
entation, siltation, and erosion. These measures shall consist of the installation of 
silt fencing, coirs, berms, and dikes to 
protect storm drain inlets and drainages. 
 No changing of oil or other fluids, or di
scarding of any trash or other construction waste materials shall occur on the project 
site. Vehicles carrying supplies, such as 
concrete, shall not be allowed to empty, cl
ean out, or otherwise place materials into 
natural areas on or immediately adjacent to the site. 
 Any equipment or vehicles driven and/or opera
ted within or adjacent to onsite drains shall be checked and maintained daily, to pr
event leaks of materials that if introduced 
to Serrano Creek could be deleterious to 
aquatic life. No equipment maintenance 
shall be conducted near onsite drains. 
BIO-7: During construction of the em
ergency overflow facility and associated rip rap, the 
construction contractor shall take measures to
 avoid impacts to sensitive riparian habitat 
within and surrounding Serrano Creek where 
feasible, such as installing construction 
impact boundaries marked by flagging or temporary fencing. If avoidance is not feasible, 

negative impacts to sensitive riparian habita
t shall be mitigated at ratios based on the quality of habitat affected. In general, sensitiv
e riparian habitat, such as Southern Sycamore 
Alder Riparian Woodland, shall be restored 
or enhanced at a ratio as determined in 
consultation with CDFG.  
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.   Impact 3.4-3: Implementation of the proposed project could conflict or have a substantial 
adverse effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the Clean Water 
Act (including, but not limited to, marsh, vernal
 pool, coastal, etc.) through direct removal, 
filling, hydrological interruption, or other. (Less than Significant with Mitigation) 
The construction of the proposed project may result 
in direct or indirect impacts to Serrano Creek 
and surrounding riparian habitat. As indicated 
in the Project Description, IRWD will install 
suitable discharge dissipation features within the 
creekbed to dissipate flows and reduce potential

largest subwatershed in the Newport Bay waters
hed and collectively drains into the northeastern 
end of Upper Newport Bay. Therefore, Serrano 
Creek is considered a Traditionally Navigable 
Water, is considered ﬁwaters of the U.S.,ﬂ and is
 subject to the jurisdiction of the USACE, as well 
as within the jurisdiction of CDFG. 
IRWD would be required to obtain a Clean Wa
ter Act Section 404 Individual or Nationwide 
Permit from the USACE, a Clean Water Act Sec
tion 401 Water Quality Certification from the 
Regional Water Quality Control Board, and a Fi
sh and Game Code 1602 Streambed Alteration 
Agreement (SAA) from CDFG for any discharge structure and dissipation features that would be 

installed within the creekbed. IRWD would be required to comply with all conditions associated 
with the Section 401, Section 404, and/or 
CDFG SAA permits. Implem
entation of Mitigation Measures BIO-8 and BIO-9
 would reduce impacts to jurisdictional resources to a less than 
significant level.  Mitigation Measures 
BIO-8: Construction activities within Serrano Creek sha
ll be limited to dry season periods 
to avoid wet weather flow c
onditions in the creekbed.  
 BIO-9: No activities shall occur within Serrano Cree
k until appropriate permits have been 
obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engin
eers, Regional Water Quality Control Board, 
and/or California Department of Fish and Game.  
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.   Biological Resource Policies  
Impact 3.4-4: Implementation of the proposed
 project could conflict with local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources, such 
as a tree preservation policy or ordinance. 
(Less than Significant with Mitigation)
 Twelve oak trees and several eucalyptus trees occur 
within the existing Baker site and two coast 
live oak trees border the south side of Serrano Creek Trail where the sewer line is proposed.   

Some of these trees may be impacted during th
e demolition of the existing facilities or the 
construction of new facilities and pipelines. A number of large trees, including sycamore, blue 

elderberry, and coast live oak occur within th
e Southern Sycamore Alder Riparian Woodland 
community in Serrano Creek which could be impact
ed and/or removed duri
ng construction of the 
discharge structure.    The City of Lake Forest (City) does not ha
ve tree ordinances for protecting tree species; therefore, a permit is not required for the removal of trees. However, a Eucalyptus Tree Cutting 

Permit must be obtained from the City prior to cutting, pruning or removing any eucalyptus trees 

during a city-imposed restriction period of Apr
il 1 through October 31. The City™s eucalyptus 
trees currently are threatened by the activity 
of the Eucalyptus Longhorn Borer Beetle, which

causes serious damage and destruction. The City 
has established a ﬁrestrictive periodﬂ for which 
no eucalyptus trees can be cut, pruned or removed during this time without a city-issued permit.   
According to the Recreation and Resource Elemen
t of the City™s General Plan, development 
proposals are reviewed for potential biological resource impacts according to CEQA and 

applicable state and federal wildlife regulation. Where significant impacts are identified, the City 
requires modifications to the project to avoid th
e impact, or require mitigation measures to reduce 
the impact. The focus of the impact assessment
 to biological resources includes the following: 
 Riparian and wetland habitat;   Coastal sage scrub habitat;  
 Rare and endangered plant and animal species;  
 Wildlife movement corridors;  
 Habitat fragmentation; and  
 Significant tree stands. 
Riparian and wetland habitats, rare and endangered plant 
and animal species, wildlife 
fragmentation, and impacts to CSS and coastal pr
ickly pear succulent scrub have been discussed above. The proposed project is located within a
nd surrounded by urban development; therefore, it 
is already fragmented from open lands
 and habitats that occur to the east of the cities™ limits.  
Moreover, there are no significant tree stands in or
 near the project boundary.  Implementation of 
Mitigation Measure BIO-5 would reduce any impact
s to CSS and coastal prickly pear succulent 
scrub to less than significant levels. Implementation of Mitigation Measure BIO-10 would reduce 

impacts to eucalyptus trees to 
a less than significant level. Mitigation Measures 
BIO-10: A Eucalyptus Tree Cutting Permit shall be obtained from the City of Lake Forest       
prior to cutting, pruning or removing any eucal
yptus trees during the restricted period, April 
1 through October 31. The transportation of or disposal of infected eucalyptus trees or logs 

shall occur only as permitted.

3.5 Cultural Resources 
This section is based on technical reports prepared by ESA (Bray, 2009; Bray, 2010; Bray, 2011) 
and Paleo Solutions, Inc (Paleo Solutions, 2009; 
Paleo Solutions, 2010a; Paleo Solutions 2010b). 
Cultural resources are defined as prehistoric and hist
oric sites, structures, and districts, or any 
other physical evidence associated with human 
activity considered important to a culture, a 
subculture, or a community for scientific, traditiona
l, religious or any other reason. For analysis 
purposes, cultural resources may be categorized
 into three groups: archaeological resources, historic architectural resources, and contemporary Native American resources. 
Archaeological resources are places where human activit
y has measurably altered the earth or left 
deposits of physical remains. Archaeological resources may be either prehistoric-era (before the 

introduction of writing in a particular area) or hist
oric-era (after the introduction of writing). The 
majority of such places in California are associ
ated with either Native American or Euro-
American occupation of the area. The most frequent
ly encountered prehistoric or historic Native 
American archaeological sites are village settle
ments with residential areas and sometimes 
cemeteries; temporary camps where food and raw 
materials were collected; smaller, briefly 
occupied sites where tools were manufactured or 
repaired; and special-use areas like caves, rock 
shelters, and sites of rock art. Historic-era arch
eological sites may include foundations or features 
such as privies, corrals, and trash dumps. 
Historic architectural resources are standing structur
es of historic or aesthetic significance that are 
generally 50 years of age or older (i.e., anything 
built in the year 1960 or before). In California, 
historic architectural resources considered for pr
otection tend to focus on architectural sites dating 
from the Spanish Period (1529-1822) through the early years of the Depression (1929-1930), 

although there has been recent attention paid to 
WWII and Cold War era facilities. Earlier historic 
resources are often associated with arch
aeological deposits of the same age. 
Contemporary Native American resources, also
 called ethnographic resources, can include 
archaeological resources, rock art, and the pr
ominent topographical areas, features, habitats, 
plants, animals, and minerals that contemporar
y Native Americans value and consider essential 
for the preservation of their traditional values. These locations are sometimes hard to define and 
traditional culture often prohibits Native American
s from sharing these locations with the public. 
Paleontology is a branch of geology that studies 
the life forms of the past, especially prehistoric 
life forms, through the study of plant and anim
al fossils. Paleontological resources represent a 
limited, non-renewable, and impact
-sensitive scientific and educational resource. As defined in this section, paleontological resources are the fossilized remains or traces of multi-cellular 

invertebrate and vertebrate animals and multi-ce
llular plants, including their imprints from a 
previous geologic period. Fossil remains such as 
bones, teeth, shells, and leaves are found in the 
geologic deposits (rock formations) where they 
were originally buried. Paleontological resources include not only the actual fossil remains, but 
also the collecting localities, and the geologic 
formations containing those localities.

Natural Setting The project area is located in a transitional area 
between an elevated coastal terrace and the Santa 
Ana Mountains, located to the north of the project
 area. Majority of the project area has been 
previously developed and is disturbed. The undi
sturbed areas of the project site are currently 
vegetated with Coastal Sage Scrub. A number of
 streams flow south from the foothills of the 
Santa Ana Mountains through Lake Forest and within the project vicinity. The nearest natural 

source of water to the project area is Serrano Cr
eek, which is located adjacent to the southern 
property boundary of the proposed Baker WTP. In 
addition, Aliso Creek is located about a mile 
to the south and Borrego Canyon Wash is located approximately 0.75 miles to the north.  
The Baker WTP project area is underlain by the Oso Sand Member of the Capistrano Formation, 
and Artificial fill. The Oso Sand Member of th
e Capistrano Formation was deposited during the 
late Miocene and early Pliocene (approximately 11 to
 4 million years ago). This rock unit consists 
of massive to poorly bedded white to grey ar
kosic sandstone. The sands are typically poorly 
sorted with siltstone and conglomeratic lenses fre
quently interbedded with them. Concretions of 
well-cemented sand occur throughout the formation (Paleo Solutions, 2009). 
The OC-33 project area is underlain primarily by the
 Paleocene (65-56 million years old) 
Silverado Formation, a nonmarine to marine 
facies, containing conglomerate, conglomeratic 
sandstone, sandstone, and discontinuous clay 
beds. Invertebrates such as oysters, sparse 
vertebrates, and fossilized avocado wood have b
een found in this formation, as well as significant 
finds of land plants. This forma
tion is considered to be of m
oderate paleontological sensitivity 
(Paleo Solutions, 2010b). 
Prehistoric Setting While it is not certain when humans first came to 
California, their presence in southern California 
by about 11,000 Before Present (B.P.) has been
 well documented. At Daisy Cave, on San Miguel 
Island, cultural remains have been radiocarbon 
dated to between 11,100 and 10,950 years B.P. 
(Byrd and Raab, 2007). On the mainland, radi
ocarbon evidence confirms occupation of the 
Orange County and San Diego County coast by a
bout 10,000 B.P. During the Paleo-Indian and 
Early Archaic periods (11,000Œ7000 B.P.) the clim
ate of southern California became warmer and 
more arid and the human population, residing mainly in coastal or inland desert areas, began 

exploiting a wider range of plant and animal
 resources (Horne and McDougall, 2003).  
Major Archaic Period traditions in southern Califor
nia include the San Dieguito and La Jolla or 
Millingstone traditions. The people of the Ea
rly Archaic San Dieguito (10,000Œ8,000 B.P.) 
tradition inhabited the chaparral zones of southwest
ern California, exploiting the plant and animal 
resources of these ecological zones (Moratto, 1984)
. The Middle Archaic La Jolla or Millingstone (8000Œ4000 B.P.) tradition is essentially a continuati
on of the San Dieguito tradition. La Jolla 
groups lived in chaparral zones or along the co
ast, often migrating between the two. Coastal 
settlement focused around the bays and estuaries of coastal Orange and San Diego Counties.

La Jolla peoples produced large, coarse stone tools,
 but also produced well-made projectile points, 
and milling slabs. The La Jolla tradition represen
ts a period of populati
on growth and increasing social complexity.  Also, this tradition is the firs
t to evidence the substantial exploitation of marine 
resources and the grinding of seeds for flour, as indi
cated by the abundance of millingstones in the 
archaeological record (Horne and McDougall, 2003). 
During the Late Holocene, there 
is evidence for the processing of acorns for food and for the increased importance of hunting and fishing (Hor
ne and McDougall, 2003). Around 1,000 B.P., a period of sustained drought, known as the Medieval 
Warm, occurred. While this climatic event did 
not appear to reduce the human population, it did lead
 to a change in subsistence strategies in order 
to deal with the substantial stress on resources.
 The processing of plant foods increased, marine 
resources were intensively exploited, a wider va
riety of animals were hunted, and trade with 
neighboring regions became more fre
quent (Horne and McDougall, 2003).  
During the Protohistoric Period (410Œ180 B.P.),
 at the time of the first Spanish presence in 
California, native populations of southern California were becoming less mobile and small 
sedentary villages formed. Although the intensity 
of trade had already been increasing, it now 
reached its zenith, with asphaltum (tar), seashells and steatite being traded from southern 
California to the Great Basin.  
Ethnographic Setting 
The project area is located on the border between
 the traditional territories of the Gabrielino and 
the Acjachemen or Juaneño people. At the ti
me of European contact, Gabrielino territory 
extended inland from the coast to the vicinity of 
present-day San Bernardino, south to the vicinity 
of Newport Bay, and north to the vicinity of Topanga Canyon (Bean and Smith, 1978). Very few 

specifics are known of Gabrielino lifeways. Data collected and presented by Kroeber (1925) 

indicate that homes were made of tule mats on 
a framework of poles, but size and shape have not been recorded. Basketry and steatite vessels were 
used rather than ceramics; ceramics became 
common only toward the end of the Mission Period in the 19th century. The Gabrielino held 

some practices in common with other groups in southern California, such as the use of 

jimsonweed in ceremonies as did the Luiseño and Ju
aneño, but details of the practices and the 
nature of cultural interaction between the Gabrie
lino and other groups in southern California are 
unknown. The language of the Gabrielino people h
as been identified as a Cupan language within 
the Takic family, which is part of th
e larger Uto-Aztecan language family. 
The Juaneño people were so called because of th
eir association with Mission San Juan Capistrano and were linguistically and culturally related to
 the neighboring Luiseño, Cahuilla, and Cupeño. 
Acjachemen/Juaneño territory extended from just ab
ove Aliso Creek in the north to San Onofre 
Canyon in the south and inland to Santiago Peak and the ridges above Lake Elsinore (Bean and 

Shipek, 1978).  
The Acjachemen lived in sedentary autonomous 
villages located in diverse ecological zones. Each settlement claimed specific fishing and coll
ecting regions. Typically villages were located 
in valley bottoms, along coastal st
rands and streams, and near moun
tain foothills. Villages were

usually sheltered in coves or canyons, on the side
 of slopes near water, and in good defensive 
spots. Trails, hunting sites, temporary hunting 
camps, quarry sites and ceremonial and gaming 
locations were communally owned, while houses,
 gardens, tools, ritual equipment, and 
ornamentation were owned by individuals or fa
milies. Most groups had fishing and gathering 
sites along the coast that they visited annually 
from January to March when inland supplies were 
scarce. October to November was acorn-gathering tim
e, when most of the village would settle in 
the mountain oak groves. Houses were conical in
 form, partially subterranean, covered with 
thatch, reeds, brush, or bark. Sweathouses were
 round and earth covered. Each village was enclosed with a circular fence and had a communal ceremonial structure at the center.  
Historic Setting  
The first European presence near the project area came in 1542, when Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo 
led an expedition along the coast. Europeans did not return until 1769, when the expedition of 

Gaspar de Portola traveled overland from Sa
n Diego to San Francisco. In the late 18th century, the Spanish began establishing missions in California 
and forcibly relocating 
and converting native 
peoples (Horne and McDougall, 2003). Mission San 
Juan Capistrano, established in 1776, was 
the nearest mission to the project area.  
Disease and hard labor took a toll on the native populations; by 1900, the Native Californian 
population had declined by as much as 95 percent (Chartkoff and Chartkoff, 1984). In addition, 

native economies were disrupted, trade routes were
 interrupted, and native ways of life were 
significantly altered.  
In 1821 Mexico, which included much of presen
t-day California, became independent from 
Spain, and during the 1820s and 1830s the 
California Missions were secularized. Mission 
property, although it was supposed to have been 
held in trust for the Native Californians, was 
handed over to civil administrators and then into
 private ownership. After secularization, many 
former Mission Indians were forced to leave 
the Missions and seek employment as laborers, 
ranch hands, or domestic servants
 (Horne and McDougall, 2003).  
In 1848 gold was discovered in California, leadi
ng to a huge influx of people from other parts of 
North America and in 1850 California became part of the United States of America. The opening 

of the Butterfield Overland Stage route in 1858 a
nd later the California Southern Railroad line in 
1882 greatly increased the number of people coming to southern California.  
History of Project Area 
The project area, along with all of the current city of Lake Forest, was encompassed by the 

Rancho Cañada de Los Alisos, owned by José Se
rrano. When the rancho system collapsed after 
California became an American state, American entrepreneur Dwight Whiting purchases large portions of the former rancho (City of Lake For
est, 2006). The small town of El Toro grew up 
around Whiting™s agricultural industry. In the 20
th century, the nearby El Toro Marine Base 
brought more residents to the area. The city of Lake Forest was incorporated in 1991.

Historic topographic maps (Santiago Peak
 1942 and 1943 15', Corona 1902 30' USGS 
quadrangles) show no human-made features at th
e Baker site within the proposed Baker WTP project area. The 1943 Anaheim 15' USGS t
opographic map shows Peters Canyon Reservoir and the associated Peters Canyon road. Earlier maps
 show no features. Historic aerial photographs 
from 1946 and 1952 show no features at the Baker site, except for a road running roughly 

northeast to southwest across what is now the central portion of the BFP. The existing BFP is 
visible in a 1972 photograph.  
The 1902 Corona 30™ USGS quadrangle indicates a 
structure on the southeast side of the creek, 
on the opposite side of the creek from the sewer alignment. Historic aerial photographs indicate 

that the Serrano Creek trail existed as a dirt road by 1980. In 1981, the site of the housing 

development north of the creek was graded. Gr
ading extended as far south as Serrano Creek, and included the entire Serrano Creek Trail area, and sewer pipeline project area (historicaerials.com). 
Historic maps do not indicate any structures or other features at the OC-33 project site. Historic 
photographs (historicaerials.com) indicate that th
e site was vacant until 1972, when the current facilities and access roads are present.  
Numerous laws and regulations requi
re federal, State, and local agencies to consider the effects a 
project may have on cultural resources. These laws and regulations stipulate a process for 

compliance, define the responsibilities of the va
rious agencies proposing the action, and prescribe 
the relationship among other involved agencies (e.g., State Historic Preservation Office and the 

Advisory Council on Historic Preservation). The 
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 
1966, as amended; the California Environmenta
l Quality Act (CEQA); and the California 
Register of Historical Resources (California Register), Public Resources Code (PRC) 5024, are 

the primary federal and State laws governing and 
affecting preservation of cultural resources of 
national, State, regional, and local significance.  
Federal Regulations National Register of Historic Places 
First authorized by the Historic Sites Act of 1935, the National Register of Historic Places 

(National Register) was established by the NHPA 
of 1966, as ﬁan authoritative guide to be used 
by federal, State, and local governments, priv
ate groups and citizens to identify the Nation™s 
historic resources and to indicate what properties should be considered for protection from 
destruction or impairmentﬂ (Code of Federal 
Regulations [CFR] 36 Section 60.2). The National 
Register recognizes both historical-period and pr
ehistoric archaeological properties that are 
significant at the national, state, and local levels.  
To be eligible for listing in the National Regist
er, a resource must be significant in American 
history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, or 
culture. Districts, sites, buildings, structures,

and objects of potential significance must meet 
one or more of the following four established 
criteria (U.S. Department of the Interior 1995): 
a) Are associated with events that have made 
a significant contribution to the broad patterns 
of our history; 
b) Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; 
c) Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type
, period, or method of construction or that 
represent the work of a master, or that po
ssess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; 

or d) Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, info
rmation important in prehistory or history. 
Unless the property possesses exceptional significance, 
it must be at least fifty years old to be 
eligible for National Register listing (U.S. Department of the Interior 1995). 
In addition to meeting the criteria of significance, a property must have integrity. Integrity is 
defined as ﬁthe ability of a property to convey its significanceﬂ (U.S. Department of the Interior 

1995). The National Register recognizes seven qualities that, in various combinations, define 

integrity. To retain historic 
integrity a property must possess sev
eral, and usually most, of these 
seven aspects. Thus, the retention of the specific 
aspects of integrity is paramount for a property 
to convey its significance. The seven factors that 
define integrity are location, design, setting, 
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association. 
State Regulations California Environmental Quality Act 
CEQA, as codified in California Public Res
ources Code (PRC) Sections 21000 et seq., is the 
principal statute governing the environmental review of projects in the State. The CEQA 

Guidelines define a historic resource as: (1) a resource in the California Register; (2) a resource 

included in a local register of historic res
ources, as defined in PRC Section 5020.1(k) or 
identified as significant in a historic resource survey meeting the requirements of PRC 

Section 5024.1(g); or (3) any object, building, st
ructure, site, area, place, record, or manuscript 
that a lead agency determines to be historically
 significant or significant in the architectural, engineering, scientific, economic, agricultural, edu
cational, social, political, military, or cultural 
annals of California, provided the lead agen
cy™s determination is supported by substantial 
evidence in light of the whole record. The California Register is ﬁan authoritative listi
ng and guide to be used by state and local 
agencies, private groups, and citizens in identifying 
the existing historic resources of the State and 
to indicate which resources deserve to be protected, to the extent prudent and feasible, from 

substantial adverse changeﬂ (PRC Section 5024.1[a]
). The criteria for eligibility to the California 
Register are based on National Register criteri
a (PRC Section 5024.1[b]). Certain resources are 
3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures 
3.5 Cultural Resources 
IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant

Final EIR 
April 2011 
determined by the statute to be automatically 
included in the California Register, including California properties formally eligible 
for or listed in the National Register. 
To be eligible for the California Register as a hi
storic resource, a prehistoric or historic-period 
resource must be significant at the local, state, 
and/or federal level under one or more of the 
following criteria: 
1) Is associated with events that have made 
a significant contribution to the broad patterns 
of California™s history and cultural heritage; 
2) Is associated with the lives of persons important in our past; 
3) Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of 
construction, or represents the work of an
 important creative individual, or possesses high 
artistic values; or, 4) Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history 
[14 CCR Section 4852(b)]. 
For a resource to be eligible for the California Regi
ster, it must also retain enough integrity to be 
recognizable as a historic resource and to convey its significance. A resource that does not retain 

sufficient integrity to meet the National Register
 criteria may still be eligible for listing in the 
California Register. CEQA requires lead agencies to determine if a pr
oposed project would have a significant effect 
on important archaeological resources, either historic resources or unique archaeological 

resources. If a lead agency determines that an ar
chaeological site is a historic resource, the 
provisions of PRC Section 21084.1 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5 would apply. If an 

archaeological site does not meet the CEQA Guide
lines criteria for a historic resource, then the 
site may meet the threshold of PRC Section 2
1083 regarding unique archaeological resources.  
A unique archaeological resource is ﬁan archaeological artifact, object, or site about which it can 
be clearly demonstrated that, without merely addi
ng to the current body of knowledge, there is a 
high probability that it meets any of the following criteria: 
 Contains information needed to answer important scientific research questions and that 
there is a demonstrable public interest in that information. 
 Has a special and particular quality such as be
ing the oldest of its type or the best 
available example of its type. 
 Is directly associated with a scientifically recognized important prehistoric or historic 
event or person [PRC Section 21083.2 (g)].ﬂ 
The CEQA Guidelines note that if a resource is neither a unique archaeological resource nor a 
historic resource, the effects of the project on that resource shall not be considered a significant 

effect on the environment (CEQA Guidelines Section 15064[c][4]).

Paleontological Resources 
Federal  A variety of federal statutes specifically address paleontological resources. They are generally 
applicable to a project if that project includes federally owned or fede
rally managed lands or 
involves a federal agency license, permit, approval,
 or funding. Federal legislative protection for 
paleontological resources stems from the Antiqu
ities Act of 1906 (PL 59-209; 16 United States 
Code 431 et. seq.; 34 Stat. 225), which calls for pr
otection of historic landmarks, historic and 
prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest on federal lands.  
State  Paleontological resources are also afforded protection by CEQA. Appendix G (Part V) of the 
CEQA Guidelines provides guidance relative to significant impacts on paleontological resources, 
stating that a project will normally result in a significant impact on the environment if it will 

ﬁ–disrupt or adversely affect a paleontologic resour
ce or site or unique geologic feature, except 
as part of a scientific study.ﬂ Section 5097.5 of
 the Public Resources Code specifies that any 
unauthorized removal of paleontological remains 
is a misdemeanor. Further, the California Penal 
Code Section 622.5 sets the penalties for the damage
 or removal of paleontological resources. 
Professional Standards 
The Society for Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) 
has established standard guidelines for acceptable 
professional practices in the conduct of paleontol
ogical resource assessments and surveys, 
monitoring and mitigation, data and fossil 
recovery, sampling procedures, and specimen 
preparation, identification, analysis, and curati
on. Most practicing professional paleontologists in 
the nation adhere closely to the SVP™s assessmen
t, mitigation, and monitoring requirements as 
specifically provided in its standard guidelines. 
Most California State regulatory agencies accept 
the SVP standard guidelines as a measure of professional practice. 
Methods  
Archival 
A project-specific cultural resources literature and records search was conducted at the California Historical Resources Information System (CHRIS) South Central Coastal Information Center 

(SCCIC) on March 17, 2009. A records search for the OC-33 component was performed on 

December 3, 2010. The records searches included an examination of previous cultural resources 
survey coverage and reports, and known cultural res
ources within a 0.5-mile radius of the project 
area. Other sources reviewed included the Californi
a Points of Historical Interest (PHI), the 
California Historical Landmarks (CHL), the California Register, the National Register, the 

California State Historic Resources Inve

Field Survey 
An archaeological survey of the Baker site, 
proposed treated water pipelines and Raw Water 
Pump Station were conducted by an ESA archaeo
logist on March 23, 2009. Undeveloped land 
was systematically surveyed in transects of 20 meters or less and the ground surface subject to 

careful inspection for cultural resources. Pave
d or highly disturbed land was subject to less 
intensive visual inspection. It was noted that mu
ch of the project area was highly disturbed. Some 
areas around the creek were too vegetated to be su
rveyed. Pipeline alignments were walked on 
both sides of centerline. The Raw Water Pump Station project area was completely covered by a 

concrete pad and existing Intertie facility.  
An archaeological survey of the Serrano Creek 
sewer pipeline project component was conducted 
by an ESA archaeologist on June 25, 2010. U
ndeveloped land was systematically surveyed in 
transects of 20 meters or less and the ground su
rface subject to careful inspection for cultural resources. 
An archaeological survey of the OC-33 project component was conducted by ESA archaeologist 
Madeleine Bray, MA, RPA, on December 15, 2010. The project area was systematically surveyed 

and the ground surface subject to careful insp
ection for cultural resources. The OC-33 facilities are situated on a flat, graded area that appears highly disturbed. 
Native American Contact 
A Sacred Lands File (SLF) search for the project
 area was requested from the Native American 
Heritage Commission (NAHC) in March, 2009. 
An updated SLF search for the sewer pipeline 
project area was requested from the NAHC in June, 2010. 
Follow-up correspondence was conducted in April, 
2009 and July, 2010, with all individuals and 
groups indicated by the NAHC as having affiliation with the project area. Follow-up 

correspondence consisted of a letter sent via certif
ied mail describing the proposed project and a 
map indicating the project area. Recipients were re
quested to reply with any information they are 
able to share about Native American resources that
 might be affected by the proposed project. 
Paleontology A project-specific literature and map review, along with a review of previously recorded fossil 
localities at the Natural History Museum of Los An
geles, was conducted in April and May, 2009, 
and July and November, 2010, for the Baker WTP and Serrano Creek pipeline project area, and in 

December, 2010 for the OC-33 project area. A site survey was conducted on April 13, 2009 of the 

Baker site and the two proposed treated water 
pipeline alignments (Paleo Solutions, 2009). An 
additional survey was conducted July 9, 2010, of
 the sewer pipeline alignment (Paleo Solutions, 
2010a). A third field survey was conducted on December 15, 2010, for the OC-33 project area 

(Paleo Solutions, 2010b). The goal of the fiel
d surveys was to determine the presence of 
paleontological resources within the disturbance lim
its of the project area. The surveys consisted 
of walking transects along bedrock outcrops a
nd visually examining bedrock outcrops for 
exposed fossil remains.

Results  Archival  
The results of records searches indicated that a to
tal of 31 cultural resources have been recorded 
within 0.5 miles of the project components. Of
 these, 19 cultural resources have been recorded within 0.5 miles of the Baker site and the propo
sed treated water pipelin
e alignments and Serrano Creek pipeline. Six cultural resources have been 
recorded within 0.5 miles of the proposed Raw 
Water Pump Station. Six cultural resources have 
been recorded within 0.5 miles of the OC-33 
project area. None of the previously recorded 
resources are located within the proposed project 
areas themselves. One of the previously recorded
 resources within the records search study area, 
resource 30-162283, Irvine Regional Park, is listed 
on both the California Register and National 
Register. 
Nine of the resources identified as part of the records search are located within 0.25 miles of the 
proposed project areas (
Table 3.5-1
). Three are within 0.25 miles of the OC-33 site. Six are 
within 0.25 miles of the Baker site, of which tw
o were recorded within 500 feet of the treated 
water pipeline alternatives. No resources are nearer
 than 0.25 miles to the Peters Canyon portion 
of the project area. 
The Baker site has been completely or partially
 surveyed for cultural resource on four occasions, 
most recently in 1989. The Raw Water Pump Sta
tion project area has been completely surveyed 
on five occasions, most recently in 1990. Five
 cultural resources investigations have been 
completed within 0.5 miles of the OC-33 project 
area, of which three overlap the project area. 
Native American Contact  
SLF search results prepared by the NAHC on March 20
, 2009, and July 2, 2010, failed to indicate 
the presence of Native American cultural resour
ces in the immediate project area. The NAHC 
results also noted, however, that the absence of speci
fic site information in the Sacred Lands File 
does not indicate the absence of cultu
ral resources in any project area.  
Two responses to the follow-up correspondence with Native American representatives have been 
received to date. The first, from Johntommy Rosa
s, requested more information on the project. 
The second response was from Robert Dorame of
 the Gabrielino/Tongva Indians of California 
Tribal Council. Mr. Dorame stated that he did 
not know of any specific cultural areas within a 
mile of the proposed project area; however, he did state that there was a higher likelihood of 

encountering cultural material along a major wa
tercourse. Mr. Dorame also provided some 
historical information on the area. 
Field Survey  
No cultural resources were observed during the 
course of the archaeological field surveys.

  Paleontology The literature and fossil locality search revealed 
that much of the Baker WTP project area is 
underlain by the Oso Sand Member of the Capi
strano Formation (Paleo Solutions, 2009). The 
Oso Sand Member was deposited dur
ing the late Miocene and early Pliocene (~11 to 4 million 
years ago). Abundant vertebrate fossils have
 been collected from the Oso Sand Member 
throughout its areas of exposure. Based on the 
huge fossil assemblage recovered and collected 
within and near the proposed project site it is 
clear that the Oso Sand Member of the Capistrano 
Formation in this area has high paleontological sensitivity. Some of the project area is underlain 

by artificial fill, which has no paleontological 
sensitivity. Finally, the sewer pipeline may be 
underlain in places by the Pliocene Niguel Formati
on, a shallow marine deposit that overlies the 
Capistrano Formation.  The literature and fossil locality search for the OC
-33 project area indicated that the project area 
was underlain primarily by the Silverado Formation 
(described above). No fossils in their records were located within the project boundaries, howev
er a specimen of turtle was located in the Silverado Formation from within the Irvine Ranch area (Paleo Solutions, 2010b).   
The pedestrian field survey indicated that the 
Baker site lies on top of undisturbed sediment from 
the Oso Sand member of the Capistrano Formati
on. The area is largely covered by asphalt and 
existing structures. However, an intact bedrock e
xposure near the buildings suggests fill is either 
non-existent in some areas or very shallow. In 
this exposure, no fossils were observed; however, 
concretion beds were observed which are known to contain various marine and terrestrial

vertebrate fossils. Additionally, pebble beds we
re observed which have produced many marine 
and terrestrial vertebrate fossils elsewhere (Paleo Solutions, 2009). 
Bedrock, consisting of the Oso Sand Member, is
 exposed at the surface along much of Option 1 
of the proposed pipeline. This proposed line would likely impact bedrock along the entire route. 

Option 2 will impact the Oso Sand Memb
er and a section of artificial fill.  
The sewer pipeline lies in the Oso Sand Member of the Capistrano Formation and possibly the 
Pliocene Niguel Formation, a shallow marine 
deposit that overlies the Capistrano Formation 
(Paleo Solutions, 2010a). The unconsolidated sedim
ents of the bike path and downslope to the 
stream appear to be undisturbed, native sedim
ents. Any disturbance of these sediments could 
potentially impact the Capistrano Formation and/or possibly the Niguel Formation. The north side 

of the bike path, adjacent to the housing comple
x, appears to be artificial fill and reworked 
sediment, though depth to bedrock is unknown.  
No significant outcrops of the Silverado Forma
tion were seen at the surface within the OC-33 
project area. However, possibly due to a recent fi
re in the area, a large amount of recently-moved 
sediment lies at the surface, and may cover outcrops
 of the Silverado Formation. No bedding or 
cross-bedding was seen, though the sparse boulders of the Silverado formation as found at the 

surface were quite well-cemented. No fossil material
 was found at the project site or within 50 feet of its boundaries during the survey (Paleo Solutions, 2010b).  
Significance Criteria 
For the purposes of this analysis, and 
consistent with Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines, a project is considered to have a significant impact if it would lead to: 
 A substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource that is either 
listed or eligible for listing in the National Register, the California Register, or a local 

register of historic resources; 
 A substantial adverse change in the significance of a unique archaeological resource; 
 Disturbance or destruction of a unique paleontological resource or site or unique geologic 
feature; or  Disturbance of any human remains, including 
those interred outside or formal cemeteries. 
CEQA provides that a project may cause a significant environmental effect where the project 
could result in a substantial adverse change in 
the significance of a historical resource (Public 
Resources Code, Section 21084.1). CEQA Guid
elines Section 15064.5 defines a ﬁsubstantial adverse changeﬂ in the significance of a hist
orical resource to mean physical demolition, 
destruction, relocation, or alteration of the r
esource or its immediate surroundings such that the 
significance of a historical resource would be ﬁmaterially impairedﬂ (CEQA Guidelines, 

Section 15064.5[b][1]). 
CEQA Guidelines, Section 15064.5(b)(2), defin
es ﬁmaterially impairedﬂ for purposes of the 
definition of ﬁsubstantial adverse changeﬂ as follows:

The significance of a historical resource is materially impaired when a project: 
 (A) Demolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical characteristics of 
an historical resource that convey its historical significance and that justify its 

inclusion in, or eligibility for, inclusion in the California Register; or 
 (B) Demolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical characteristics 
that account for its inclusion in a local register of historical resources pursuant to 

Section 5020.1(k) of the Public Resources C
ode or its identification in an historical 
resources survey meeting the requirements of Section 5024.1(g) of the Public 

Resources Code, unless the public agency reviewing the effects of the project 

establishes by a preponderance of evidence that the resource is not historically or 

culturally significant; or 
 (C) Demolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical characteristics of 
a historical resource that convey its historical significance and that justify its 

eligibility for inclusion in the California Regi
ster as determined by a lead agency for 
purposes of CEQA. 
 In accordance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5(b)(3), a project that follows the Secretary 
of the Interior™s 
Standards for the Treatment of Hist
oric Properties with Guidelines for 
Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, a
nd Reconstructing Historic Buildings or Standards for 
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for 
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings is considered to have mitigated impacts to historic resour
ces to a less than significant level. 
Historic resources are usually 50 years old or older and must meet at least one of the criteria for 
listing in the California Register (such as association with historical events, important people, 

architectural significance, or possess important data 
value), in addition to maintaining a sufficient 
level of physical integrity (CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5[a][3]). 
Impacts Discussion 
The following is a discussion of the potential effect
s of the proposed project to cultural resources 
according to the key issue areas identified in Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines
.  Historic Resources 
No archaeological or built architectural cultural 
resources either listed on or eligible for the National Register, California Register, or local register are known to be located within the project 
site, nor are there any resources within the proj
ect area that meet CEQA™s definition of a unique 
archaeological resource. Therefore, there would be
 no impact to known historical resources as a 
result of project implementation.

Baker WTP, Treated Water Pipeline, and Sewer Pipeline 
No cultural resources have been r
ecorded in the within the boundaries of proposed disturbance for 
the Baker WTP, treated water pipeline, and 
sewer pipeline; and no cultural resources were 
observed during the 2009 and 2010 archaeological su
rveys. Nineteen cultural resources have been 
recorded within 0.5 miles of the Baker site, th
e proposed treated water pipeline alignments, and 
sewer pipeline. All of these resources are prehistori
c archaeological sites. Six of the resources are 
within 0.25 miles of the project area; two sites ha
ve been recorded within 500 feet of the treated 
water pipeline alternatives.   
The area has been previously disturbed by the construction of the existing BFP, existing pipelines 
that are located in the proposed pipeline ali
gnments, the adjacent housing development, and the 
Serrano Creek trail. However, the large number 
of prehistoric archaeological sites in close 
proximity to the project area and its location along a reliable water source indicates that the 

project area has some archaeological sensitivity,
 particularly for prehistoric archaeological 
resources. 
Since the nature of the proposed project would involve ground-disturbing activities, it is possible 
that such actions could unearth, expose, or dist
urb subsurface archaeological resources that were 
not observable on the surface, which would result in a significant impact. However, with 
implementation of Mitigation Measu
re CUL-2, impacts associated with unanticipated discovery 
of archaeological resources with be reduced to 
a less than significant level. Given the greater 
archaeological sensitivity associated
 with the alignments for the treated water pipeline and sewer 
pipeline, the implementation of construction m
onitoring as described in Mitigation Measure 
CUL-1 would further ensure that potential im
pacts associated with ground disturbance are 
reduced to less-than-significant levels.   Raw Water Pump Station  
No cultural resources have been recorded in 
the project area, and no cultural resources were 
observed during the 2009 archaeological survey. While the number of archaeological sites (six) in 
close proximity to the project area indicates that
 the area has some archaeological sensitivity, the 
area has been previously disturbed by the constr
uction of the existing pump station. Since the 
nature of the proposed project would involve gro
und-disturbing activities, it is possible that such 
actions could unearth, expose, or disturb subs
urface archaeological resources that were not 
observable on the surface, which would resu
lt in a significant impact. However, with 
implementation of Mitigation Measu
re CUL-2, impacts associated with unanticipated discovery 
of archaeological resources with be reduced to a less than significant level. 
OC-33 Meter Exchange 
No cultural resources have been recorded in 
the project area, and no cultural resources were 
observed during the 2010 archaeological survey. While the number of archaeological sites (six) in 
close proximity to the project area indicates that
 the area has some archaeological sensitivity, the 
area has been previously disturbed by the cons
truction of the existing facilities. Much of the 
ground disturbance at the OC-33 site would ta
ke place within previously disturbed soils. 
However, since the nature of the proposed proj
ect would involve ground-disturbing activities, it is

Mitigation Measures 
CUL-1: Archaeological Monitoring. Prior to th
e start of any earth-moving activity, an 
archaeological monitor shall be retained by the IRWD to monitor ground-disturbing 

activities associated with the construction of
 the treated water pipelines and the Serrano Creek sewer pipeline, including but not limited 
to grading, excavation, brush clearance and 
grubbing. The monitor shall be, or shall wo
rk under the supervision of, a qualified 
archaeologist, defined as an archaeologist meeting the Secretary of the Interior™s Standards 
for professional archaeology (Department of th
e Interior, 2010). The duration and timing of 
monitoring shall be determined by the qualif
ied archaeologist in consultation with the 
IRWD and based on the grading plans. Initially
, all ground-disturbing activities shall be 
monitored. However, the qualified archaeologi
st, based on observations of soil stratigraphy 
or other factors, and in consultation with IRWD, may reduce the level of monitoring as 

warranted. In the event that cultural resources are unearthed during ground-disturbing 
activities, the archaeological monitor shall be empowered to halt or redirect ground-

disturbing activities away from the vicinity of 
the find so that the find can be evaluated. Due to the sensitivity of the project area for 
Native American resources, at least one Native 
American monitor may, if requested, also 
monitor ground-disturbing activities in the 
project area. The monitor(s) shall be select
ed from amongst the Native American groups 
identified by the Native American Heritage
 Commission as having affiliation with the 
project area. 
CUL-2: Unanticipated Discovery. During construc
tion of all project components, if a 
cultural resource is encountered, construction activities shall be redirected away from the 
immediate vicinity of the find until it can be evaluated by a qualified archaeologist. If the 

find is determined to be potentially significan
t, the archaeologist, in consultation with the 
IRWD and appropriate Native American group(s)
 (if the find is a prehistoric or Native 
American resource), shall develop a treatment plan. Construction activities shall be 
redirected to other work areas until the treatment plan has been implemented or the 
qualified archaeologists determines work can 
resume in the vicinity of the find.  
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.  Paleontological Resources 
Impact 3.5-2: Implementation of the proposed
 project could adversely affect paleontological 
resources. (Less than Significant with Mitigation) 
The Baker WTP project area lies on top of undisturbed sediment from the Oso Sand Member of 
the Capistrano Formation, as well as artificial 
fill (Paleo Solutions, 2009 and 2010). The Oso

Sands have high paleontological sensitivity, while 
artificial fill has no paleontological sensitivity 
(Paleo Solutions, 2009).  
The OC-33 project area is underlain by the Silverado formation, which has a moderate 
paleontological sensitivity. Some artificial fill is
 also present in the project area, which has no sensitivity (Paleo Solutions, 2010b). 
Fossils and their associated contextual data ar
e nonrenewable scientific resources; the loss of 
these resources resulting from a project, for exampl
e due to construction-related excavation and ground disturbance, would be a significant adver
se impact. Earthmoving operations can result in 
the destruction of fossils and rock units 
within the construction disturbance limits. 
Implementation of
 Mitigation Measure CUL-3 and CUL-4 during proj
ect construction would ensure potential impacts to paleontological resour
ces are reduced to less than significant levels. 
Mitigation Measures 
CUL-3: Paleontological Mitigation and Monitoring Plan.
 Prior to the start of any earth-
moving activity, IRWD shall retain an Ora
nge County Certified Paleontologist.  The 
Paleontologist shall prepare a Paleontological 
Mitigation and Monitoring Plan that provides 
for the treatment of paleontological resources 
in accordance with the mitigation guidelines 
for areas of high potential outlined by the SV
P. The mitigation and monitoring plan shall 
address pre-construction salvage and reporti
ng; pre-construction contractor sensitivity 
training; procedures for paleontological resources monitoring; microscopic examination of 
samples where applicable; the evaluation, rec
overy, identification, and curation of fossils, 
and the preparation of a final mitigation report. 
CUL-4: Paleontological Monitoring. All earth moving activities in the Oso Sand Member 
of the Capistrano Formation and the Silvera
do Formation shall be monitored full time, 
unless the paleontologist determines that sediments are previously disturbed or there is no 

reason to continue monitoring in a particular
 area due to other depositional factors, which 
would make fossil preservation unlikely or deemed scientifically insignificant. If it 
becomes apparent to the paleontologist that bedrock will not be impacted in an area, 
monitoring may be suspended temporarily until 
bedrock is impacted again. Spot-checking 
by the paleontologist will be allowed to dete
rmine if bedrock is being impacted. If impacts 
to bedrock resume, full-time monitoring will 
resume. In the event fossils are exposed 
during earth moving, construction activities sha
ll be redirected to other work areas until the procedures outlined in the Paleontological M
itigation and Monitoring Plan have been 
implemented or the paleontologist determines work
 can resume in the vicinity of the find.  
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.  Human Remains

project would involve ground-disturbing activities, 
it is possible that such actions could unearth, expose, or disturb previously unknown human re
mains interred outside of a formal cemetery. 
Mitigation Measure CUL-5 is recommended to ensu
re that impacts to human remains would be 
less than significant.  Mitigation Measures 
CUL-5: If human remains are encountered unexpectedly during construction excavation 
and grading activities, State Health and Safety Code Section 7050.5 requires that no further 
disturbance shall occur until the County Cor
oner has made the necessary findings as to 
origin and disposition pursuant to PRC Section 5097.98. If the remains are determined to 
be of Native American descent, the cor
oner has 24 hours to notify the NAHC. The NAHC 
will then identify a Most Likely Descendent
 (MLD), of the deceased Native American, who will provide recommendations as to the futu
re disposition of the remains. Per Public 
Resources Code 5097.98, the landowner shall ensu
re that the immediate vicinity, according 
to generally accepted cultural or archaeologi
cal standards or practices and taking into 
account the possibility of multiple human rema
ins, where the Native American human 
remains are located, is not damaged or distur
bed by further development activity until the 
landowner has discussed and conferred with th
e MLD, as prescribed in this section (PRC 
5097.98).

3.6 Geology, Soils and Mineral Resources 
This section evaluates whether construction and ope
ration of the proposed project would result in 
potential adverse impacts related to local geolog
y, existing soil conditions, seismicity, or mineral 
resources. The evaluation and an
alysis of geology, soils, 
mineral resources, faulting and 
seismicity are based, in part, on review of vari
ous geologic maps and reports. The geologic and 
geotechnical evaluation of the proposed project al
so include review of available geologic maps, resources, geotechnical studies, and summaries.  

Regional Setting The project area lies within a region of California referred to as the Peninsular Ranges 

geomorphic province.
1 The Peninsular Ranges consist of a series of ranges that are separated by 
northwest trending valleys, subpara
llel to faults branching off of the San Andreas Fault. The trend 
of topography is similar to the Coast Ranges, but 
the geology is more like the Sierra Nevada, with 
granite rock intruding the older metamorphic ro
cks. The province extends into lower California 
and is bound on the east by the Colorado Desert Province (CGS, 2002a). 
The cities of Lake Forest and Orange are near th
e coastal margin of the Los Angeles Basin, which 
includes Orange County, and is underlain by more
 than 15,000 feet of stratified sedimentary 
rocks of marine origin. The Santa Ana Mount
ains and adjacent hills are located in the 
northeastern portion of the cities and form the east
ern boundary of the Los Angeles Basin. The 
San Andreas fault zone, about 40 miles northeast of the proposed project area, is the boundary 

between the Pacific Plate, on the west side of 
the zone, and the North American Plate on the east 
side. One of the results of the movement of these 
plates is the regional rock deformation that is expressed in the general northwest trend of valleys
 and ridges in the Los Angeles Basin. All of the geologic formations in the Los Angeles Ba
sin are on the Pacific Plate (Oakeshott, 1978). 
Topography 
The City of Lake Forest comprises about 17 square miles in a transition zone between an elevated 
coastal terrace and the Santa Ana Mountains. Th
e western portion of the City, on the coastal 
terrace, is about 200 feet above mean sea leve
l (amsl). The land becomes progressively higher 
and steeper to the east, eventually reaching elev
ations above 1,500 feet amsl along the ridgeline 
of the Santa Ana Mountains. Traces of fault seg
ments associated with the Newport- Inglewood 
Fault Zones parallel the ocean edge of the coast
al terrace. Traces of the Elsinore Fault Zone 
follow the ridge of the Santa Ana Mountains (Yerkes, 1965). 
The City of Orange encompasses two general typologies of terrain: 1) an alluvial plain (deposits 
of silt, clay, gravel, or sand) that underlies the 
central and western portions of the planning area; 
                                                     
 1 A geomorphic province is an area th
at possesses similar bedrock, structur
e, history and age. California has 11 
geomorphic provinces (CGS, 2002a).

and 2) a series of low hills (foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains) found in the eastern and 
northern portions of the planning area. Genera
lly, the alluvial plain is underlain by many 
thousands of feet of fluvial and floodplain sedim
ents. Certain areas of the plain are adjacent to 
major watercourses: the Santa Ana River and Sa
ntiago Creek. The low hills are underlain by bedrock of mostly Tertiary mari
ne and nonmarine sediments). Active faults in proximity to the 
City include the Elsinore fault zone
 and Newport Inglewood fault zone.  
The project area at the Baker site includes an upper area that ranges in elevation from 645 feet to 
628 feet and a lower area that ranges in elevation from 615 feet to 555 feet. The upper area has a 

gradual slope of approximately 60 feet descending to
 the south and west, with the toe of the slope bordering residential properties. The lower area slopes toward the south and east, descending to 
Serrano Creek. 
Soils Approximately three dozen soil types can be fou
nd throughout the Lake Forest region. These soil 
typologies are related to the substrate on which 
they have developed. Soil types or series are 
based on a variety of distinguishing characteris
tics, such as texture, slope, and agricultural 
capability. The Oso Member of the Capistrano Format
ion is predominant at the Baker site with a 
typical profile of sandy loam and weathered bedr
ock, with local areas of surficial deposits of 
older alluvium and artificial fill ( (Paleo
 Solutions, 2009; USDA, 2010; GMU, 2010). 
Within the City of Orange, the Raw Water Pump Station is mapped primarily with Alo Clay 
which has a typical profile of clay and weathere
d bedrock (USDA, 2010). In general the Alo Clay 
has a moderate erosion potential and a high shri
nk/swell potential. The site is underlain by 
bedrock of the Sespe and Vaqueros Formations, with minor amounts of artificial fill also present 
(GMU, 2010). The bedrock consists of sandst
one with lesser amounts of siltstone and conglomeratic sandstone, generally 
dense to very dense (GMU, 2010). 
The OC-33 site is located in the foothills of 
the Santa Ana Mountains in unincorporated Orange 
County. Soils on this site are mapped as Cieneba san
dy loam characterized generally by sandy loam 
underlain by weathered bedrock (USDA, 2010). Cien
eba soils are considered somewhat excessively 
drained (USDA, 2010). The OC-33 project area is underlain primarily by the
 Paleocene (65-56 million years old) Silverado Formation, a nonmarin
e to marine facies, containing conglomerate, 
conglomeratic sandstone, sandst
one, and discontinuous clay beds (Paleo Solutions, 2010). 
Seismicity  
Southern California is a region of high seism
ic activity with numerous active and potentially 
active faults.2 Major earthquakes have affected the region in
 the past and can be expected to occur 
                                                     
 2  An 
active fault is defined by the California 
Geological Survey is a fault that has had surface displacement within 
Holocene time (approximately the last 11,000 years). A 
potentially active
 fault is a fault that has shown evidence of 
surface displacement during the last 1.6 
million years, unless direct geologic evidence demonstrates inactivity for the 
last 11,000 years or longer. This definition does not mean 
that faults lacking evidence of surface displacement are 
necessarily inactive. 
Sufficiently active
 is also used to describe a fault if there is some evidence that Holocene surface 
displacement occurred on one or more of
 its segments or branches (Hart, 1997).

again in the near future on one of the active fa
ults within the vicinity of Lake Forest. The 
principal active faults in the region include 
the Newport-Inglewood and Elsinore fault zones. 
Additional active faults at a greater distance fro
m the City include the Palos Verdes Fault zone, 
the San Jacinto Fault zone, the San Andreas Fault 
Zone, the Sierra Madre Fault zone, and the Santa Monica-Raymond Fault zone 
(City of Lake Forest, 2006).  
Portions of two potentially active faults, the Pera
lta Hills fault and the El Modena fault, are 
located in Orange near the proposed Raw Water Pump Station and OC-33 site. These faults are 
shown in Figure 3.6-1
.With no recent record of activity, prevailing scientific thought is that 
neither is anticipated to be capable of gene
rating significant earthquakes. Geologists debate 
whether the El Modena fault is active. The Peralta Hills fault is an approximately east/west-
trending, north-dipping, thrust fault, that runs 
from the crossing of Lincoln Avenue over the Santa 
Ana River on the northwest, easterly along the base of
 the Peralta Hills and into the City of Villa 
Park, and then southerly into the hills west of 
Peters Canyon Reservoir. The El Modena fault, a 
southwest-dipping, north/south-trending, normal faul
t, runs from its intersection with the Peralta 
Hills fault at the base of Peralta hills, southeasterly to Chapman Avenue (City of Orange, 2009).  
Richter magnitude (M) is a measure of the size of
 an earthquake as recorded by a seismograph, 
the standard instrument that records ground shaking. The reported Richter magnitude for an 
earthquake represents the highest amplitude measured by the seismograph at a distance of 

100 kilometers from the epicenter. Richter magn
itudes vary logarithmically, with each whole 
number step representing a tenfold increase in the 
amplitude of the recorded seismic waves. 
Earthquake magnitudes are also measured by thei
r moment magnitude (Mw), which is related to 
the physical characteristics of a fault, including th
e rigidity of the rock, the size of fault rupture, 
and the movement or displacement across a fault (CGS, 2002b).  
The project sites are roughly bound by the Newport- Inglewood Fault zones to the south and the 
Elsinore fault zones to the north (Figure 3.6-1). The Newport- Inglewood fault zone was 

responsible for both the 1933 Long Beach Eart
hquake (magnitude M6.3) and the 1920 Inglewood 
Earthquake (estimated magnitude M4.9).  
Table 3.6-1 lists the location of regionally active fau
lts significant to the project areas due to 
proximity, activity status, date of most recent 
motion, and maximum moment magnitude (Mmax). 
The Mmax is the strongest earthquake that is likely to be generated along a fault and is based on 
empirical relationships of surface rupture length, ru
pture area, and fault type, which are all related 
to the physical size of fault rupture and displacement across a fault.  
The Elsinore fault is a 180 kilometer right-lateral st
rike-slip zone that is one of the largest in 
southern California. At its northern end, the El
sinore fault zone splays into two segments, the 
Chino fault and the Whittier fault. At its southern
 end, the Elsinore fault is cut by the Yuba Wells 
fault from what amounts to its southern continuation:
 the Laguna Salada fault. Several of the fault 
strands that make up the Elsinore fault zone possess their own names. Northwest of Lake Elsinore 
are the Glen Ivy North and Glen Ivy South faults
. Heading southeast from Lake Elsinore, the two 
parallel fault strands are the Wildomar fault 
(the most easterly) and the Willard fault.

SOURCES: Jennings, 1994; Hart, 1997; Hart
 et al, 1989; SCEDC, 2010; GMU, 2010. 
  The Laguna Salada fault ruptured in 1892 in a 
magnitude M7 earthquake, but the main trace of 
the Elsinore fault zone was the magnitude M6 earthquake of 1910 near Temescal Canyon 
(SCEDC, 2010).  
The Newport-Inglewood fault is a 75 kilometer right- 
lateral, local reverse slip associated with 
fault steps. Surface trace is discontinuous in the 
Los Angeles Basin, but the fault zone can easily 
be identified by the existence of a chain of low 
hills extending from Culver City to Signal Hill. 
South of Signal Hill, it roughly parallels the co
astline until just south of Newport Bay, where it 
heads offshore, and becomes the Newport-Inglewood - Rose Canyon fault zone (SCEDC, 2010). 
Seismic Hazards 
Surface Fault Rupture Seismically induced surface fault rupture or 
ground rupture is defined as the physical 
displacement of surface deposits in response to an earthquake™s seismic waves. The magnitude 
and nature of fault rupture can vary for different
 faults, or even along different strands of the 
same fault. Surface fault rupture is considered more likely along active faults.

The project sites are not located within an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone, as designated by 
the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act,
 and no mapped active faults are known to pass 
through the immediate project region (CGS, 2010). Therefore, the risk of ground rupture at the 

project site is very low.  
Ground Shaking Earthquakes in the southern California region coul
d produce strong ground shaking in the project 
vicinity. Ground-shaking intensity is partly relate
d to the size of an earthquake, the distance to the site, and the response of the geologic materials that underlie a site. As a rule, the greater the 
earthquake magnitude and the closer the fault ruptur
e to a site, the greater the intensity of ground 
shaking. Violent ground shaking is generally ex
pected at and near the epicenter of a large 
earthquake; however, different types of geologic 
materials respond differently to earthquake 
waves. For instance, deep unconsolidated ma
terials can amplify earthquake waves and cause 
longer periods of ground shaking. Based on the proxim
ity of the site to the regional active faults, 
in particular the Elsinore and Newport-Inglewood faults, there is a potential for significant 
ground-shaking within the project site. 
Ground motion during an earthquake can be d
escribed using the motion parameters of 
acceleration, velocity, and duration of shaking. 
A common measure of ground motion is the peak 
ground acceleration (PGA). The PGA for a given component of motion is the largest value of 

horizontal acceleration obtained from a seismograph. PGA is expressed as the percentage of the 

acceleration due to gravity (g), which is approxi
mately 980 centimeters per second squared. For 
example, the maximum PGA recorded during th
e 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (San Andreas 
fault) was in the vicinity of th
e epicenter, near Santa Cruz, at 0.64 g. According to estimates made 
by the CGS, the PGA at the Baker site could reach
 up to 0.374 g, up to 0.392 g at the Raw Water 
Pump Station, and up to 0.446 g at OC-33 (CGS, 2010b, 2010c; GMU, 2010).
3   
Liquefaction 
Soil liquefaction, a phenomenon in which soils lo
se strength, can result in ground failure. The 
soils most susceptible to liquefaction are clean, 
loose, uniformly graded, saturated, fine-grained 
soils that occur close to the ground surface, usually at depths of less than 50 feet. In general, 
upland areas have a low liquefaction potential, except where significant alluvium is present in 

creek bottoms or swales. 
                                                     
 3  A probabilistic seismic hazard map shows the predicted level of hazard from earthquakes that seismologists and 
geologist believe could occur. The map™s analysis takes in
to consideration uncertainties 
in the size and location of 
earthquakes and the resulting ground motions that can affect 
a particular site. The maps are typically expressed in 
terms of probability of exceeding a certain ground motion. 
These maps depict a 10% pr
obability of being exceeded 
in 50 years. There is a 90% chance that these ground moti
ons will NOT be exceeded. Th
is probability level allows 
engineers to design buildings for larger ground motions 
than seismologists think will occur during a 50-year 
interval, making buildings safer than if they were only de
signed for the ground motions that are expected to occur 
in the 50 years. Seismic shaking maps are prepared us
ing consensus information on 
historical earthquakes and 
faults. These levels of ground shaking are used prim
arily for formulating building codes and for designing 
buildings. (CGS, 2008a)

According to the City of Lake Forest 1994 General 
Plan Safety Element, the entire City is located 
within an area of low liquefaction hazard (City of
 Lake Forest, 1994). According to the California 
Department of Conservation (CDC), the Baker site and the treated water pipelines would not be 
located in a seismic hazard zone for liquefaction (CDC, 2001) (
Figure 3.6-2
). However, the proposed sewer pipeline would be located within
 the seismic hazard zone for liquefaction 
associated with Serrano Creek (CDC, 2001) (Figure 
3.6-2). According to the City of Orange 
Public Safety Element and the CDC the proposed
 Raw Water Pump Station site would not be 
located in a liquefaction hazard area (CDC, 1998; City of Orange, 2009) (
Figure 3.6-3
). According to the County of Orange, the OC-33 s
ite is not located in a liquefaction hazard area (County of Orange, 2005) (
Figure 3.6-4). Seismically Induced Landslides A landslide is a mass of rock, soil, and debris 
displaced down-slope by sliding, flowing, or 
falling. The susceptibility of land (slope) failure is
 dependent on the slope and geology as well as 
the amount of rainfall, excavation, or seismic 
activities. Factors that decrease resistance to movement in a slope include pore water pressure, material changes, and structure. Removing the 

lower portion (the toe) of a slope decreases or 
eliminates the support that opposes lateral motion 
in a slope. Shaking during an earthquake may lead materials in a slope to lose cohesion and 

collapse. According to the CDC, the Baker site, treated wa
ter pipeline, and sewer pipeline, are not located 
in an area that is considered susceptible to an earthquake-induced landslide (CDC, 2010) (Figure 
3.6-2). The Raw Water Pump Station also is not lo
cated near an area cons
idered susceptible to an earthquake-induced landslide (CDC, 1998; City of 
Orange, 2009) (Figure 3.6-3). According to 
the County of Orange, the OC-33 site is not lo
cated in an area considered susceptible to an 
earthquake-induced landslide (County of
 Orange, 2005) (Figure 3.6-4). 
Geologic Hazards 
Landslides and Slope Failure Ground failure is dependent on the slope and geol
ogy as well as the amount of rainfall, human 
activities such as excavation, or seismic activity. A sl
ope failure is a mass of rock, soil, and debris 
displaced downslope by sliding, flowing, or fa
lling. Landslide-susceptible areas are characterized 
by steep slopes and downslope creep of surface materi
als. Debris flows consist of a loose mass of 
rocks and other granular material that, if saturated and present on a steep slope, can move 

downslope. 
The rate of rock and soil movements can vary 
from a slow creep over many years to a sudden 
mass movement. Landslides occur throughout the state of California, but the density of incidents 

increases in zones of active faulting. There is a low potential for landslides at all project sites (City of Lake Forest, 1994; CDC 1998, 2001; Ci
ty of Orange, 2009; County of Orange, 2005).

Expansive Soils Expansive soils possess a shrink-swell characteristic 
that can result in structural damage over a 
long period of time. Expansive soils are largely 
comprised of silicate clays, which expand in 
volume when water is absorbed and shrink when dried. Soils in and around the Baker site and 

OC-33 do not exhibit shrink-swell characteristics as 
their composition is that of sandy loam. The 
Alo Clay soils found throughout the Raw Water Pump Station area may potentially exhibit 

shrink-swell characteristics (USDA, 2010). 
Erosion 
Erosion is the detachment and movement of soil materials through natural processes or human 

activities. The detachment of soil particles can be
 initiated through the suspension of material by 
wind or water. Silt-sized particles are the most eas
ily removed particles, due to low particle mass 
and cohesiveness. Soils in the project areas are su
sceptible to wind erosion, especially during the 
spring and fall months when wind speeds increase.
 Soils at OC-33 also would be susceptible to 
erosion due to storm water runoff during the rainy season. 
Settlement 
Settlement is the gradual downward movement of
 an engineered structure (such as a building) 
due to the compaction of unconsolidated mate
rial below the foundation. Settlement accelerated 
by earthquakes can result in vertical or horizontal separations of structures or portions of one 

structure; cracked foundations, roads, sidewalks,
 and walls; and (in severe situations) building 
collapse and bending or breaking of underground u
tility lines. Soils susceptible to settlement can 
only be determined on a site specific basis as th
e engineering characteristics that determine the 
ability to accommodate new loadings without settling 
can vary considerably from site to site. The 
presence of any artificial fill, if discovered, can 
be particularly susceptible to settlement unless 
given appropriate compaction and geotechnical preparation.   
Mineral Resources 
The California Geological Survey (CGS) classifies the regional significance of mineral resources 

in accordance with the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. Mineral 
Resource Zones (MRZ) have been designated to indicate the significance of mineral deposits. The 
MRZ categories are as follows: 
MRZ-1: 
Areas where adequate information indicat
es that no significant mineral deposits 
are present or where it is judged that little likelihood exists for their presence. 
MRZ-2: 
Areas where adequate information indicates significant mineral deposits are 
present, or where it is judged that a high likelihood exists for their presence. 
MRZ-3:
 Areas containing mineral deposits the si
gnificance of which cannot be evaluated 
from available data. 
MRZ-4: 
Areas where available information is inad
equate for assignment to any other MRZ. 
There are no MRZs in the vicinity of the project sites.

State California Building Code (CBC) 
The California Building Code (CBC) has been codi
fied in the California Code of Regulations (CCR) as Title 24, Part 2. Title 24 is admi
nistered by the California Building Standards Commission, which, by law, is responsible for 
coordinating all building standards. Under state 
law, all building standards must be centralized
 in Title 24 or they are not enforceable. The 
purpose of the CBC is to establish minimum standa
rds to safeguard the public health, safety and 
general welfare through structural strength, me
ans of egress facilities, and general stability by 
regulating and controlling the design, constructi
on, quality of materials, use and occupancy, 
location, and maintenance of all building and stru
ctures within its jurisdiction. The CBC is based on the International Building Code. The 2010 CBC 
is based on the 2009 International Building 
Code (IBC) published by the International Code Conference.  In addition, the CBC contains necessary California amendments which are based
 on reference standards obtained from various 
technical committees and organizations such as the 
American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 
,the American Institute of Steel Construction (AIS
C), and the American Concrete Institute (ACI). 
ASCE Minimum Design Standards 7-05 provides requ
irements for general structural design and 
includes means for determining earthquake loads 
as well as other loads (flood, snow, wind, etc.) 
for inclusion into building codes. The provisions 
of the CBC apply to the construction, alteration, 
movement, replacement, and demolition of every 
building or structure or any appurtenances 
connected or attached to such buildings or structures throughout California. 
The earthquake design requirements take into acc
ount the occupancy category of the structure, 
site class, soil classifications, and various seismic
 coefficients which are used to determine a 
Seismic Design Category (SDC) for a project.  The SDC is a classification system that combines 

the occupancy categories with the level of expected ground motions at the site and ranges from 
SDC A (very small seismic vulnerability) to SD
C E (very high seismic vulnerability and near a 
major fault).  Design specifications are 
then determined according to the SDC. 
CCR Title 24 also includes the California Residential Code (based on the 2009 International 
Residential Code) and the California Green Build
ing Code, which have been adopted as separate 
documents (CCR Title 24, Part 2.5 and 11, r
espectively). The California Residential Code 
includes structural design standards for residential one and two family dw
ellings and covers all 
structural requirements for conve
ntional construction. All other 
structures including multi-family 
residential projects are found in the CBC. The Ca
lifornia Green Building Code (CALGreen)(June 
2010) includes mandatory measures for non-residential development, including light pollution 

reduction, energy efficiency, water efficiency
 and conservation, material conservation and 
resource efficiency, pollutant control a
nd VOC limits, indoor air quality etc.

Seismic Hazards Mapping Act 
The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 was deve
loped to protect the public from the effects 
of strong ground shaking, liquefaction, landslides,
 or other ground failure, and from other hazards 
caused by earthquakes.  This act requires the Stat
e Geologist to delineate various seismic hazard 
zones and requires cities, counties, and othe
r local permitting agencies to regulate certain development projects within these zones.  Before 
a development permit may be granted for a site 
within a Seismic Hazard Zone, a geotechnical investigation of the site must be conducted and 
appropriate mitigation measures incorporated into 
the project design. The project site coincides 
partially within a Seismic Hazard Zone for liquefaction, as designated by the California 

Geological Survey. Therefore, evaluation and mitig
ation of potential liquefaction hazards must be 
conducted in accordance with the California Geologi
cal Survey, Special Publication 117, adopted 
March 13, 1997 by the State Mining and Geology Board pursuant to the Seismic Hazards 

Mapping Act, as discussed in the Impacts 
and Mitigations chapter below.   Local 
Lake Forest General Plan 
The City of Lake Forest General Plan (City of
 Lake Forest, 1994) provides goals and policies, 
related to seismicity and seismic hazards, wh
ich identifies and assesses natural and human-made 
safety hazards and minimizes associated danger to life and property. These hazards have a direct 

impact on the quality of life and the well-being of 
residents of Lake Forest and Orange County.  
Safety and Noise Element  
The Safety and Noise Element of the Lake For
est General Plan is concerned with providing a 
comprehensive analysis of seismic factors, among other issues, to reduce loss of life, injuries, 

damage to property, and social and economic 
impacts resulting from future earthquakes. The 
Element focuses on current developmental policies, 
as well as the allocation of future land uses, 
and its purpose is to serve as a guide for future
 development such that development will be responsive to seismic safety considerations. To pr
ovide a general direction for development in the 
City, goals, policies, and implementation programs regarding seismic safety are presented in the 

Element. The goal and policy applicable to the proposed project are: 
Goal 1.0: Reduction in the risk to the community from hazards associated with the geologic 
conditions, seismic activ
ity and flooding.  Policy 1.1: Reduce the risk of impacts from geologic and seismic hazards.  
Orange General Plan The City of Orange General Plan contains goals
, policies, and plans that are intended to guide development decisions. The General Plan includes 
a Public Safety Element and the following are 
goals and policies that are related 
to seismicity and geologic hazard: 
Goal 1.0: Protect residents and businesses from seismic hazards and other geologic constraints.

Orange County General Plan 
The Orange County General Plan contains goals, 
policies, and plans that are intended to guide 
development decisions in relationship to identif
ied physical hazards in the planning area. The 
Orange County General Plan includes a Safety 
Element that contains the following goals and 
policies that are related to seismicity and geologic hazard: 
Public Safety Goal 2: Minimize the effects of 
public safety hazards through implementation of 
appropriate regulations and standards whic
h maximize protection of life and property. 
Objective 2.1: To create and maintain plans and programs which mitigate the effects of 
public safety hazards. 
Objective 2.2: To encourage the development and utilization of technologies that 
minimize the effects of public safety hazards.  
Seismic Safety and Geologic Ha
zards, Policy 5: To encourage establishment of seismic design 
criteria and standards for county facilities (e.g., 
transmission lines, water and sewage systems, 
and highways), any structures housing necessary m
obile units and support equipment, and other 
vital resources which would be needed followi
ng an earthquake (e.g., "backup" power generation 
facilities and water storage). 
Significance Criteria 
In accordance with Appendix G of the CEQA Gu
idelines, a geologic or seismic impact is 
considered significant if it would: 
 Expose people or structures to potential substan
tial adverse effects, including the risk of 
loss, injury, or death involving: 
Œ Rupture of a known earthquake fault, as delineated on the most recent Alquist-Priolo 
Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist for the area or based on 

other substantial evidence of a known fault; 
Œ Strong seismic ground shaking; 

Œ Seismic-related ground failure,
 including liquefaction; or 
Œ Landslides.  Result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil; 
 Be located on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable or that would become unstable as a 
result of the project, and potentially result in 
onsite or offsite landslide, lateral spreading, 
subsidence (i.e., settlement), liquefaction, or collapse; 3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

 Be located on expansive soil, as defined in Table 18-1-B of the Uniform Building Code 
(1994), creating substantial risks to life or property;  
 Have soils incapable of adequately suppor
ting the use of septic tanks or alternative 
wastewater disposal systems where sewers are 
not available for the disposal of wastewater. 
Impacts Discussion 
Surface Fault Rupture The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act, si
gned into law in December of 1972, requires 
the delineation of zones along active faults in California. The purpose of the Alquist-Priolo Act is 
to regulate development and prohibit construction 
on or near active fault traces to reduce hazards 
associated with fault rupture. The Alquist-Priolo 
Earthquake Fault Zones are the regulatory zones 
that include surface traces of active faults (CDC
, 2010). There are no known Alquist-Priolo fault 
zones in the vicinity of the proposed project components (Hart, 1997). Therefore, the proposed 

project would not adversely affect people or stru
ctures due to fault rupture. There would be no 
impact. 
 Septic Tanks 
The proposed project would not involve the use of septic tanks. There would be no impact 
Mineral Resources The proposed project areas are not classified by th
e City of Lake Forest General Plan (1994), 
Orange General Plan (2009), or Orange County 
General Plan (2005) as having significant mineral 
deposits and are not located near an important mi
neral resource recovery 
site. Implementation of 
the proposed project would not result in the loss of
 availability of an important mineral resource 
or mineral resource recovery s
ite. There would be no impact. 
Ground Shaking and Seismic Hazards 
Impact 3.6-1: Implementation of the proposed
 project could expose people and structures to strong seismic ground shaking, seismic related ground failure, and landslides. (Less than 
Significant) The proposed project is located in a seismically
 active area that has the potential to experience 
strong ground shaking, seismic-related liquefac
tion, and landslides. The closest faults to the 
proposed Baker site, treated water pipeline, and sewer
 pipeline in the City of Lake Forest are the 
Newport-Inglewood and Elsinore Faults, which 
are located approximately seven miles and 
fourteen miles from the site, respectively. Other re
gional faults include the offshore Palos Verdes 
fault, the Whittier fault, and the San Jacinto fau
lt. The Newport-Inglewood fault is considered an 
active fault and thus requires special near-source 
factors to be incorporated into buildings 
developed within 10 kilometers of the fault.
 A major earthquake associated with any of these 
faults could result in moderate to severe groun
dshaking in the project area and would be a 
potential hazard to the proposed project. Damage 
to buildings and infrastructure associated with

the proposed project, both above and belowground, could be expected as a result of 
groundshaking during a seismic event. 
 The Raw Water Pump Station is located in the Ci
ty of Orange, which is traversed by two minor 
faults, the Peralta Hills Fault and the El Modena
 Fault, which are located approximately one-mile 
west and two-miles west of the site, respectively. Displacements along these two faults are 

smaller than more prominent regional faults, su
ch as the Elsinore Fault located approximately 
seven miles from the site. The maximum proba
ble earthquake magnitudes would be much less 
than those along regional faults. The OC-33 site is located approximately 1.5 miles north of the 
Raw Water Pump Station and also in close proximity to these faults. 
The California Building Code (CBC) (CCR Title 24) provides engineering design criteria for 
grading, foundations, retaining walls, and stru
ctures within zones of seismic activity. The 
procedures and design limitations for the design of structures are based on site characteristics, 

occupancy type, configuration, structural system
 height, and calculated seismic design criteria. 
Seismic design criteria consider site specific data
 including distance to active faults, soil types, 
and seismic coefficients that are based on an
ticipated maximum seismic events. The proposed 
project components would be designed to include 
all technical specifications required by the 
seismic safety codes according to the CBC; as 
a result, compliance with CCR Title 24 would 
minimize impacts due to seismic ground shaking, la
ndslides, and liquefaction. Therefore, impacts 
would be less than significant.  
Mitigation Measures
 None required. 
 Soil Erosion Impact 3.6-2: Implementation of the proposed project could result in substantial soil 
erosion or loss of topsoil. (Less than Significant with Mitigation) 
Soil removal from grading, trenching and excava
tion activities for all components of the proposed 
project would reduce soil cohesion. Excavated soils
 would be stockpiled and potentially exposed 
to erosive forces such as wind and water. Furthe
rmore, excavation or grading also would expose 
base soils to erosion by wind or water. As required by state law, a Storm Water Pollution 

Prevention Plan (SWPPP) would be a requirement of project approval. In compliance with the 

statewide NPDES General Permit for Discharg
es of Storm Water Runoff Associated with 
Construction Activity (General Construction Pe
rmit) (Order No. 99-08-DWQ), a SWPPP would 
be prepared, including an Erosion Control Plan to minimize soil erosion during construction and 

would prevent soil from washing off the construction site into storm drains, Serrano Creek, 

Santiago Creek, and other natural habitats. Implementation of 
Mitigation Measure GEO-1 would ensure best management practices for soil eros
ion and sediment control measures are included in 
the SWPPP.

Final EIR 
April 2011 
Design of the proposed Baker WTP and Raw Wate
r Pump Station would include resurfacing the 
disturbed area with paved asphalt, which would reduce erosion. As a result, operation of these 
facilities would not result in erosion or loss of topsoil. To ensure the proposed pipelines would 

not cause erosion or loss of topsoil, post-construc
tion site restoration is 
required. Implementation 
of Mitigation Measure AES-2, which requires a 
post-construction restor
ation and revegetation 
plan, would reduce impacts to a 
less-than-significant level.  
Mitigation Measures 
GEO-1:  
IRWD shall require the construction contractor to include best management 
practices (BMPs) in the Storm Water Pollu
tion Prevention Plan for the project, to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation from th
e project sites, including but not limited 
to the following: use of sediment barrier
s and traps, silt basins, and silt fences. 
 Implement 
Mitigation Measure AES-2
. Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.  Unstable Soil, Liquefaction, Landslide 
Impact 3.6-3: The proposed project may be located on a geologic unit or soil that is 
unstable, or that would become unstable as a result of the project, and potentially result in 

on- or off- site landslide, lateral spreading, subs
idence, liquefaction, or collapse. (Less than 
Significant with Mitigation) 
None of the project components are located in an 
area that is considered susceptible to landslides. 
The City of Lake Forest planning area is consid
ered to have a low potential for liquefaction and 
subsidence (City of Lake Forest, 1994). Accordi
ng to the CDC, the Baker site, treated water 
pipeline, Raw Water Pump Station, and OC-33 site
 would not be located in a liquefaction zone. 
However, the proposed sewer pipeline would be
 located in a liquefaction hazard area. 
Implementation of Mitigation Measure GEO-2 
would require pre-construction geotechnical 
assessments to address liquefaction potential and to 
determine the site-specific design criteria to 
mitigate potential risks due to liquefaction. Furthermore, all of the proposed project facilities 
would be designed and constructed in compliance with the CBC (CCR Title 24) to minimize 
impacts due to landslides, lique
faction, and subsidence.  
The upper area of the Baker site has a gradual slope of approximately 60 feet to the south and 
west, with the toe of the slope bordering resi
dential properties. The Baker WTP facilities would 
be built in accordance with the required CBC slope se
tback requirements to eliminate the risk for 
slope failure. Construction of the Baker WTP fac
ilities also would be required to comply with 
federal and state regulations to reinforce cut slopes and excavated areas to ensure stability. The 
use of sheet piling, shoring, bracing or other provisions would be recommended as a result of the

geotechnical assessment required by Mitigation Measu
re GEO-2. As a result, impacts associated 
liquefaction and other geological hazards would be less than significant with mitigation.  
Mitigation Measures
 GEO-2:
 Prior to approval of construction plans for the proposed project, a design-level 
geotechnical investigation, including collecti
on of site-specific subsurface data shall be 
completed by IRWD for all project components.
 The geotechnical investigation shall be conducted by a certified engineering geologist 
or registered geotechnical engineer. The 
geotechnical investigation shall identify 
appropriate engineering considerations, 
including density profiles, approximate maximum shallow groundwater level, vertical 
and lateral extent of the saturated sand/silt layers that could unde
rgo liquefaction, and potential presence of expansive soils. The geotechnical investigation shall recommend 
site-specific design criteria to mitigate poten
tial risks due to liquefaction, landslides, subsidence, and expansive soils. Recommende
d design criteria shall be in accordance 
with SP 117 where appropriate (e.g., sewer pi
peline) and become part of the proposed 
project. Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.  Expansive Soil Impact 3.6-4: The proposed project may 
be located on expansive soils. (Less than 
Significant with Mitigation) 
Soils with shrink-swell or expansive properties typi
cally occur in fine-grained clay sediments and 
cause damage through volume changes as a resu
lt of a wetting and drying process. Structural 
damage may occur over a long period of time, usua
lly the result of inadequate soil and foundation 
engineering or the placement of structures directly on expansive soils.  
Implementation of Mitigation Measure GEO-2 
would require pre-construction geotechnical 
assessments to determine whether expansive soils
 exist in and around each project component 
and to determine the site-specific design criteria to mitigate potential risks due to expansive soils, 
such as soil replacement or conditioning. In addition, all project facilities would be designed and 
constructed in compliance with the CBC (CCR Title
 24) to minimize impacts due to expansive 
soils. Impacts would be less than significant with mitigation

3.7 Hazards and Hazardous Materials 
This section assesses potential impacts that could arise as a result of the proposed project 
associated with hazardous materials use, discovery
 of hazardous materials in the subsurface, and 
hazards associated with wildfires and airports
. Section 25501(o) of the California Health and 
Safety Code defines "hazardous material" as 
any material that, because of its quantity, 
concentration, or physical or chemical char
acteristics, poses a significant present or potential 
hazard to human health and safety or to the envi
ronment if released into the workplace or the 
environment. Hazardous materials include, 
but are not limited to, hazardous substances, 
hazardous waste, and any material that would be in
jurious to the health and safety of persons or 
harmful to the environment if released into the workplace or the environment.  

Regional Setting  Hazardous materials are used throughout the citi
es of Lake Forest and Orange for a variety of 
purposes. These include manufacturing, service indus
tries, small businesses, agriculture, medical clinics, schools and households.  
Areas of Fire Hazard 
The open space north of Portola Parkway between 
Portola Hills and Foothill Ranch, the Whiting 
Ranch Wilderness Area, and a small portion of 
open space extending south to Portola Parkway 
northwest of the Foothill Ranch community have be
en identified in the Lake Forest General Plan 
Safety and Noise Element as areas of fire hazard (City of Lake Forest, 1994). The proposed Baker 

site is not in an area of fire hazards. 
In the Orange General Plan Public Safety El
ement, wildland fire hazard areas are identified 
primarily along the developed r
esidential fringe of hillsides that represents the wildland-urban 
interface (City of Orange, 2009). The proposed Raw 
Water Pump Station is located in a Wildland 
Very High Fire Hazard Area, as delineated on the 
City of Orange™s Environmental and Natural 
Hazard Policy Area (City of Orange, 2009). The OC-
33 site is also located in a Very High Fire 
Hazard Area, as delineated in the City of Or
ange™s Environmental and Natural Hazard Policy 
Area (City of Orange, 2009) and the County of 
Orange™s General Plan Land Use Element (2005). 
The surrounding undeveloped hillside areas are 
characterized by coastal sage scrub, oak 
woodlands, and other vegetation types that are 
highly prone wildland fires (City of Orange, 
2009).  
Abandoned Landfills The City of Orange contains several abandoned an
d closed landfills, which contain wastes that 
can release toxins into both the air and groundwat
er, as well as former landfills at La Veta and Grijalva parks. The three abandoned landfills are 
located at Chapman Avenue and Yorba Street

(the current site of Yorba Park), Lincoln Avenue
 and Glassell Street, and near Cannon Street and 
Serrano Avenue to the west of the City of Villa 
Park. Two closed landfills are located at Santiago 
Canyon Road to the west of Villa Park (the fo
rmer Santiago Canyon Landfill) and in the hillside 
area west of Irvine Lake (City of Orange, 2009). 
Orange County Oil Field  
The County of Orange oil fields are located in th
e City of Lake Forest. According to the State 
Department of Conservation Division of Oil, 
Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR), four 
abandoned dry wells are located within the City boundaries. 
Transportation of Hazardous Materials  
Orange County contains a trans
portation network consisting of hi
ghways, pipelines, air, rail and 
water systems that transport hazardous materials 
throughout the region. The State Department of 
Transportation regulates the transport of hazardous ma
terials through the City of Lake Forest and 
Orange and has designated I-5 and SR-241 as the 
transportation routes for hazardous materials. 
Further, the California Highway Patrol has designated I-5, I-405, SR-57, and SR-91 as hazardous 

materials corridors (City of Lake Forest, 2006).  
Project Area Setting Contaminated Soils A database search was conducted to identify the 
hazardous materials / waste sites present in the 
project vicinity. The purpose of this inquiry was to determine whether the location of proposed 

project components would coincide with areas of c
ontaminated soils. Potential contaminated sites 
in the project vicinity were identified w
ith a review of the following databases: 
 Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) databases: Identifies potential sources of 
soil contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons
 and petroleum related volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) (SWRCB, 2010). 
 Envirostor databases: The California Department of Toxic Substances Control™s 
(DTSC™s) Site Mitigation and Brownfields 
Reuse Program™s (SMBRP™s) EnviroStor 
database identifies sites that have known contamination or sites for which there may be 

reasons to investigate further. The database includes the following site types: Federal 
Superfund sites (National Priorities List (NPL)); State Response, including Military 

Facilities and State Superfund; Voluntary Cleanup; and School sites. EnviroStor provides 

similar information to the information that
 was available in CalSites, and provides 
additional site information, including, but not limited to, identification of formerly-

contaminated properties that have been
 released for reuse, properties where 
environmental deed restrictions have been 
recorded to prevent inappropriate land uses, 
and risk characterization information that 
is used to assess potential impacts to public 
health and the environment at contaminated sites (DTSC, 2010).

State Water Resource Control Board (LUST), the Integrated Waste Board (SWF/LS), and 

the Department of Toxic Substances Control (Cal-Sites).  
 Solid Waste Landfill (SWLF) and Toxic Pits databases: for potential sources of soil contamination associated with solid waste 
landfills, including petroleum constituents, 
VOCs, and metals (CalEPA, 2010). 
The review of the database report indicates that no sites qualified as a potential source of soil 
contamination within a quarter mile of the proposed
 project elements. For purpose of this review, 
sites are considered relevant if they appear
 on the LUST database and the case remains open or 
undefined, if they appear on the Envirostor da
tabase, or if they appear on the SWLF or Cortese 
databases.  
Hazardous Materials 
Preliminary hazardous materials assessments for th
e Baker site and Raw Water Pump Station site 
have indicated the presence of lead-based pain
t and asbestos-containing materials (ACM) in 
existing structures to be demolished as a result 
of the proposed project (Panacea, Inc., 2010a, 
2010b).  
Lead-based paint is defined and regulated by va
rious federal and state agencies, including the 
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC
), U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD), and the California Department
 of Public Health (DPH) (CCR Title 17, 
Section 35033). As part of construction waste,
 lead-based paint can be considered hazardous 
waste (CCR Title 22, Section 66261.24). Demo
lition activities also can result in exposure of 
construction workers to airborne lead particles th
at can be hazardous at certain concentrations.  Asbestos is a known carcinogen, and inhalation of 
asbestos may result in the development of lung 
cancer or mesothelioma. When a material contains
 asbestos in concentrations greater than one percent, it is considered an asbestos-containi
ng material (ACM) (CCR Title 8, Section 1529; 
DOSH, 1996). When an ACM is present in ar
eas that workers/employees perform work, 
notification and training are required by Cal OSHA (DOSH, 1996). ACM are present at the Baker 

site and Raw Water Pump Station 
site in some pipes, gaskets, and roofing materials. However, 
the ACM is not considered to be ﬁfriableﬂ and therefore is not considered to be hazardous waste. 
Chemical Usage and Delivery 
Operation of the proposed Baker WTP would invol
ve onsite chemical use and storage. Chemicals 
would be stored in the proposed dedicated chem
ical storage building with secondary containment 
areas to confine accidental spills and prevent e
xposure to the environment. An inventory of 
chemicals that would be stored and used at the Baker WTP is provided 
in Table 3.7-1 
below. Brief descriptions of each chemical are also pr
ovided below. Chemical delivery trucks would 
access the Baker WTP via Biscayne Bay Drive or 
via Palmwood and Wisteria, depending on the 
size, width, and turning radius requirements of 
the vehicles. Planned future development on the 
vacant land north of the Baker site would include construction of new roadways. When and if

Aqua Ammonia 
Aqua Ammonia is a corrosive liquid that may be 
fatal if swallowed. MSDS defines a corrosive 
material as a highly reactive substance that can cau
se damage to living tissue; corrosive materials 
behave directly by chemically destroying an
 object or indirectly by causing inflammation 
(MSDS, 2008). Its vapor is toxic and irritating to 
eyes, nose, throat, and skin. The vapor is highly 
flammable under limited conditions. Aqua ammonia 
may cause caustic injury; a caustic injury is 
a substance that is capable of burning and destroyi
ng living tissue.  The severity of injury depends 
upon the concentration (MSDS, 2008). Aqua ammonia is stored at an ambient temperature in a 

dry ventilated area.  
Sodium Chlorite 
Sodium Chlorite is a hazardous solid in the case of 
skin contact (irritant), eye contact (irritant), 
and ingestion or inhalation. Prolonged expose on th
e skin may result in skin burns and ulcerations 
and over-exposure by inhalation can result in d
eath.  Sodium Chlorite is not a flammable 
material. In case of a spill it is recommended to k
eep the substance damp 
by using water spray. 
The substance is stored in a dry tight contai
ner in a cool, well-ventilated place (MSDS, 2008).

Chlorine Dioxide Chlorine Dioxide is a gas that is harmful if swa
llowed or inhaled and is corrosive to the skin and 
eyes. Chlorine Dioxide should be stored in 
a cool, dry environment. In case of a spill, the 
contaminated area should be isolated and ventilate
d; to remove the gas, water is sprayed and 
spilled liquid is contained with sand or earth (M
SDS, 2008). Chlorine Dioxide does not present a fire or explosion hazard and is 
stable under ambient conditions.  
Sodium Hydroxide (Caustic Soda) 
Sodium Hydroxide is a highly hazardous liquid that 
if inhaled or contact with the skin occurs, can 
cause irritation or possibly severe chemical burns; 
if eye contact occurs it may cause irritation or 
severe eye damage, and if ingested the substance can cause chemical burns, nausea, or vomiting 

(MSDS, 2008). The substance is stable at ambient 
temperatures. Sodium Hydroxide is stored in a 
cool, dry ventilated area away from heat and moistu
re. In the incident of a spill, the spill should 
be contained in order to prevent contaminati
on of ground water or surface water (MSDS, 2008). 
Sodium Hydroxide does not present a fire or explosive hazard.  
Ferric Chloride 
Ferric Chloride is a highly corrosive solid that if ingested is hazardous, if contact with skin or 
eyes occurs the substance can cause severe blisteri
ng or blindness, respectively. The substance is 
highly toxic to the lungs. In the incident of a 
small spill, the spilled solid is contained in an 
appropriate waste disposal container or it can be
 neutralized with a dilute solution of sodium 
carbonate, and during a large spill, the corrosive 
solid must be sprayed with water to reduce 
vapors (MSDS, 2008). Ferric Chloride
 is not a flammable substance.  Hydrochloric Acid 
Hydrochloric Acid is an extremely corrosive liquid 
that if contact with skin or eyes occurs can 
cause serious damage such as itching, scaling, redde
ning, and blistering. If inhaled, the substance 
may cause severe irritation to the respiratory tract.  
Hydrochloric Acid is stored in a tightly closed 
container in a cool, well-ventilated area.  During a small spill, the substance is diluted with water and mopped up or absorbed with a dry material, such as dry earth or sand (MSDS, 2008). 

Hydrochloric Acid is not flammable; however
 it posses a fire and explosive hazard in the 
presence of certain metals such as alkali, copper and alloys (MSDS, 2008).  
Citric Acid Citric Acid is a corrosive solid that if contact with skin or eyes occu
rs can cause severe tissue 
damage; eye contact can result in corneal dama
ge or blindness and skin contact can produce 
inflammation and blistering (MSDS, 2008). Inha
lation can cause lung irritation or produce lung 
damage.  Citric Acid is stored in a tightly clo
sed container in a cool, well-ventilated area. During 
a small spill, the material is disposed in a cont
ainer and the contaminated surface is spread with 
water (MSDS, 2008). Citric Acid is highly 
combustible at high temperatures and slightly 
flammable in the presence of heat.

Sodium Bisulfite  Sodium Bisulfite is a hazardous solid that can 
cause skin and eye irritations. The substance can 
cause lung damage if prolonged exposure occurs.  Sodi
um Bisulfite is stored in a tightly closed 
container in a cool, well ventilated area.  During a small spill, the solid is contained in waste 
disposal container and the contaminated surface 
is spread with water (MSDS, 2008). Sodium 
Bisulfite does not present a fire hazard and is no
n-flammable; it poses an explosive risk in the 
presence of mechanical impact or the presence of static discharge (MSDS, 2008).  
Sodium Hypochlorite  
Sodium Hypochlorite is a hazardous liquid that can
 cause skin and eye irritation; skin contact 
would result in skin burns and eye contact woul
d result in tissue damage. Inhalation would cause 
severe irritation to the respiratory tract. Sodium 
Hypochlorite is stored in a tightly closed 
container in a cool, well-ventilated area.   During a small spill, the substance is diluted with water and mopped up or absorbed with a dry material, 
such as dry earth or sand. Sodium Hypochlorite 
is a non-flammable substance; it poses a fire hazar
d in the presence of various substances such as 
combustible materials, metals, and organic material
s; and is slightly explosive in the presence of 
open flames (MSDS, 2008).   
Federal 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
The federal Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) enforces regulations 
covering the handling of hazardous materials in th
e workplace. The regulations established in the 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 29 are designed to protect workers from hazards 
associated with encountering hazardous materials 
at the work site, including lead-containing 
waste. The regulations require certain training, 
operating procedures, and protective equipment to 
be used at work sites that could encounter hazardous materials.  
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
Under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), individual states may 
implement their own hazardous waste programs in lieu of RCRA as long as the state program is 

at least as stringent as federal RCRA requirements and is approved by the U.S. Environmental 

Protection Agency (USEPA). The USEPA appr
oved California™s RCRA program, called the 
Hazardous Waste Control Law (HWCL), in 1
992. The California Environmental Protection 
Agency (Cal EPA) and the DTSC, a department
 within Cal EPA, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. DTSC has primary regulatory 

responsibility for hazardous materials, but can de
legate enforcement responsibilities to local 
jurisdictions that enter into agreements with DTSC
 for the generation, transport, and disposal of 
hazardous materials under the authority of the HWCL.

Toxic Substance Control Act 
The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) of 1976 was enacted by Congress to give the USEPA 
the ability to track the 75,000 industrial chemicals 
currently produced or imported into the United 
States. The USEPA repeatedly 
screens these chemicals and can require reporting or testing of 
those that may pose an environmental or 
human-health hazard. The USEPA can ban the 
manufacture and import of those chemicals that pose an unreasonable risk. 
CERCLA 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response,
 Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 
(CERCLA) was developed to protect the water, air, and land resources from the risk created by 
past chemical disposal practices. This act is al
so referred to as the Superfund Act, and the sites 
listed under it are referred to as Superfund sit
es. Under CERCLA, the USEPA maintains a list, 
known as CERCLIS, of all contaminated sites in th
e nation that have in part or are currently 
undergoing clean-up activities. CERCLIS contains 
information on current hazardous waste sites, 
potential hazardous waste sites, and remedial ac
tivities. This includes sites that are on the 
National Priorities List (NPL) or being considered for the NPL.  
State California Code of Regulations 
The California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title
 22, Section 66261.20-24 contains technical 
descriptions of characteristics that would classi
fy wasted material, including soil, as hazardous 
waste. When excavated, soils having concentra
tions of contaminants higher than certain 
acceptable levels must be handled and disposed 
as hazardous waste. When demolished, structural features containing lead-based paint also can 
be considered hazardous waste, depending on concentrations, and must be handled and disposed as hazardous waste. 
California Hazardous Materials Rele
ase Response Plans and Inventory Law 
The California Hazardous Materials Release Res
ponse Plan and Inventory Law of 1985 (Business 
Plan Act) requires that businesses that store h
azardous materials on site prepare a Hazardous 
Materials Business Plan and submit it to local h
ealth and fire departments. The business plan must include details of the facility and business 
conducted at the site, an inventory of hazardous 
materials that are handled and stored onsite, an 
Emergency Response Plan, and a Site Safety Plan 
that includes an emergency response training program for new employees with an annual 

refresher course. 
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
In California, the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal OSHA) 
regulates worker safety similarly to the federal OSHA. OSHA has developed worker safety 

regulations for the safe abatement of lead-based paint and primers (Lead in Construction 

Standard, CCR Title 8, Section 1532.1). OSHA also 
has developed regulations for notification of 
employees and workers when asbestos containi
ng materials are present in the workplace 
(Construction Safety Order, CCR Title 8, Section 1529).

Unified Hazardous Waste and Hazardou
s Materials Management Regulatory 
Program In January 1996, Cal EPA adopted regulations
, which implemented a Unified Hazardous Waste 
and Hazardous Materials Management Regulatory Program (Unified Program). The program has 

six elements: (1) hazardous waste generato
rs and hazardous waste onsite treatment; 
(2) underground storage tanks (USTs); (3) a
boveground storage tanks (ASTs); (4) hazardous materials release response plans and inventories; 
(5) risk management and prevention programs; 
and (6) Unified Fire Code hazardous materials ma
nagement plans and inventories. The plan is 
implemented at the local level and the agency 
responsible for implementation of the Unified 
Program is called the Certified Unified Progr
am Agency (CUPA). In Orange County, the 
Environmental Health Division is the designated CUPA. 
Department of Toxic Substance Control  
The DTSC is responsible for regulating the use, 
storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous 
substances in the state. DTSC maintains a Haza
rdous Waste and Substances Site List for site 
cleanup. This list is commonly referred to as th
e Cortese List. Government Code section 65962.5 
requires the Cal-EPA to update the Cortese List at least annually. DTSC is responsible for a 
portion of the information contained in the Cortese List. Other State and local government 

agencies are required to provide additional hazar
dous material release information for the Cortese 
List.  DTSC considers ACM to be hazardous waste only if
 it is ﬁfriableﬂ and contains one percent or 
more of asbestos (DTSC, 2009). A friable waste is
 one that can be reduced to dust or powder 
under hand pressure when dry. Although there ar
e ACMs onsite within existing structures at the 
Baker site and Raw Water Pump Station site, none
 of the ACMs have been determined to be 
friable and therefore are not considered to be hazardous waste (Panacea, 2010b). 
California Accidental Release Prevention Program 
The California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulates facilities that use or 

store regulated substances, such as toxic or flammable chemicals, in quantities that exceed 
established thresholds (California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5). 
The purpose of the CalARP program is to prevent 
accidental releases of regulated substances and 
reduce the severity of releases that do occur. Th
e CalARP Program meets all requirements of the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency™s (U
SEPA) Risk Management Program, established 
pursuant to the Clean Air Act Amendments (42 USCA Section 7412(4)). The CalARP Program 

requires facilities that use regulated substances to develop a Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
The County of Orange Environmental Health Division administers the CalARP Program in the 
City of Orange (City of Orange, 2009). The Orange County Fire Authority administers the 

CalARP Program in the City of Lake Forest (OCFA, 2009).

Lake Forest General Plan, Safety and Noise Element  
Operation of the proposed Baker WTP would result in the transportation, storage, and use of 
hazardous materials in the City of Lake Forest 
at the Baker site. The Lake Forest Safety and 
Noise Element states that the City will work to
 minimize the accident and health risk from 
hazardous materials with the following approaches:  
 Cooperate with federal, state and local agencies to effectively regulate the management 
of hazardous materials and hazardous waste; 
 Cooperate with the County of Orange to 
implement applicable portions of the County 
Hazardous Waste Management Plan;  Establish defined roadway transportatio
n routes for the conveyance of hazardous 
materials (the City does not exercise jurisd
iction over transportation of freight along 
railroad right-of-way);  
 Develop an emergency response plan for accidents involving hazardous materials. 
Significance Criteria 
In accordance with Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines
, the proposed project would result in 
potentially significant impacts if it would: 
 Create a significant hazard to the public or th
e environment through the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials; 
 Create a significant hazard to the public or
 the environment through foreseeable upset 
and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials into the 
environment; 
 Result in hazardous emissions or the handling of hazardous or acutely hazardous 
materials, substances, or waste within a quart
er mile of an existing or proposed school; 
 Be located on a site that is included on a list of hazardous materials sites compiled 
pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5
 and, as a result, would create a significant 
hazard to the public or the environment; 
 Be located within an area covered by an air
port land use plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted, within two miles of a public
 airport or public use airport, and would 
result in a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area;  
 Be located within the vicinity of a private 
airstrip and would result in a safety hazard for 
people residing or working in the project area;  
 Impair implementation of or physically in
terfere with an adopted emergency response 
plan or emergency evacuation plan; or

Title 40 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (40 CFR) and Title 
22 of the California Code of Regulations define and identify 
hazardous materials and wastes an
d provide threshold levels for these substances. Regulatory agencies determine wh
at constitutes a ﬁsubstantialﬂ hazard or an ﬁinsignificantﬂ level of hazardous materials on 
a case-by-case basis, depending on the proposed 
uses, potential exposure, and degree and type of hazard. 
Impacts Discussion  
The following is a discussion of the potential eff
ects of the proposed project to Hazards and 
Hazardous Materials according to the key issue areas identified in Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines.  Schools Construction of the proposed project would require 
the use of fuels, oils, and lubricants that can 
be hazardous to the environment. In addition,
 the operation of the proposed Baker WTP would 
involve onsite chemical use and storage. Thr
ee schools are located near the Baker site and 
proposed pipelines: Lake Forest Montessori School is located approximately one-half mile south; 

Fullbright Montessori Academy is located a
pproximately one-half mile north; and Rancho 
Canada Elementary School is
 located approximately one mile southwest. Chapman Hills 
Elementary school is located approximately 
one mile from the proposed Raw Water Pump 
Station and 1.5 miles from the OC-33 site. Sa
ntiago Canyon College is 
over one mile from OC-
33. All nearby schools are over one-quarter mile from the proposed project sites; therefore, there 

would be no impact.  
Hazardous Materials Sites 
Government Code Section 65962.5 requires the Ca
l EPA to develop and annually update the 
Hazardous Waste and Substances Sites (Cortese) List. The Cortese List is a planning document 

used by state and local agencies to comply w
ith CEQA requirements in providing information 
about the location of hazardous materials release s
ites. The information contained in the Cortese 
List is provided by Cal EPA™s DTSC and other state and local government agencies.  
The proposed Baker WTP, treated water conveyan
ce pipeline, sewer pipeline, Raw Water Pump 
Station and OC-33 Meter Exchange are not located
 on sites listed on the Cortese List for Orange 
County (DTSC, 2010). The DTSC Envirostor Da
tabase was searched in March 2010 for 
hazardous material sites within the cities of 
Lake Forest and Orange (DTSC, 2010) and in November 2010 for sites near OC-33 in unincor
porated Orange County. The Database did not 
identify any hazardous material sites within th
e City of Lake Forest. The nearest hazardous 
materials site to the Baker site and proposed pi
pelines is the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) El Toro, which has been designated as a federal 
Superfund Site. The Baker site and proposed 
pipelines would be located approximately two m
iles southeast of MCAS El Toro. The nearest

hazardous materials site to the Raw Water Pump 
Station is the Southern California Gas/Orange 
Voluntary Cleanup Site. The proposed pump station 
would be located approximately seven miles 
east of the site. The nearest hazardous materials si
te to OC-33 is located at Irvine Regional Park 
in the City of Irvine. The site was a Former
ly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) that involved the 
investigation or remediation, either in lead 
or support capacity (DSTC, 2010). The cleanup status 
is active and the DSTC is the oversight agency
 conducting the site cleanup. The proposed meter 
exchange and pipeline replacement would be locat
ed approximately 0.41 miles north of the site. 
The proposed project would not be located on a 
hazardous material site and would not create a 
significant hazard to the public or the environment. There would be no impact.  
Public Airport or Private Airstrip The proposed project would not be located within an airport influence area or any other airport 

safety zones. The proposed project would be locat
ed approximately two miles southeast of the 
MCAS El Toro. However, the air station was decommissioned on July 2, 1999 (DTSC, 2010). 

The proposed project would be located approximately 12 miles east of John Wayne Airport. 

Therefore, construction and operation of the proposed project would not result in an airport 

related safety hazard. There would be no impact. 
Transport, Use, Disposal and Release of Hazardous Materials 
Impact 3.7-1: The proposed project could create a significant hazard to the public or the 
environment through routine transport, use or
 disposal of hazardous materials that may 
result in accident conditions involving th
e release of hazardous materials into the 
environment. (Less than Significant with Mitigation) 
Operational Impacts The CalARP Program requires facilities that u
se regulated substances to develop a Risk 
Management Plan (RMP). IRWD would be require
d to prepare a RMP for the Baker WTP and to keep the RMP on file with the Orange County 
Fire Authority and USEPA. The RMP is a public 
document that reflects a facility™s overall effort 
to manage and prevent risks associated with the 
storage, use, and/or processing of regulated subs
tances. The regulated substances that would be 
stored and/or used onsite at the Baker WTP are 
listed in Table 3.7-1. These regulated substances 
would be housed in the Chemical Storage Building (Figure 2-4) with secondary containment 

areas to confine accidental spills and prevent exposure to the environment. 
 The California Hazardous Materials Release Res
ponse Plans and Inventory Program (CCR Title 
19, Division 2, Chapter 4) requires facilities th
at store hazardous materials onsite to prepare a 
Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) that
 includes an inventory of hazardous substances 
and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The HM
BP is submitted to local health and fire 
departments. In the event of an accident, the re
lease of hazardous materials must be immediately 
reported to local fire and emer
gency personnel and appropriate county and state agencies.  
Operation of the Baker WTP would require deliv
ery of the chemicals listed in Table 3.7-1, 
resulting in up to 20 truck trips per month. Th
e transport of hazardous materials is regulated by

Trabuco Road. Delivery vehicles would access the Ba
ker site using either Biscayne Bay Drive or 
Peachwood, Palmwood, Wisteria. If the site di
rectly north of the proposed Baker WTP is 
developed (City of Lake Forest Opportunities Stud
y, Site #3) and associated new roadways are 
built, then chemical delivery vehicles also woul
d access the Baker site using Indian Ocean Road 
(see Figure 2-5 in the Project Description).The proposed project would not create a significant 

hazard to the public due to the tr
ansport of hazardous materials. 
Implementation of the RMP, HMBP, and ERP would reduce potential risks to the public, 
environment, and sensitive receptors through trans
port, use, or accidental release of hazardous 
materials at the Baker WTP to less than significant 
levels. Therefore, the risk of injury to the 
public or environment due to hazard material tr
ansport or use would be less than significant. Construction Impacts 
Demolition and site preparation activities at the 
Baker site and Raw Water Pump Station site 
would involve demolition of existing structures 
that contain lead-based paint and asbestos-containing materials (ACM). IRWD would be re
quired to comply with all federal and state 
regulations pertaining to worker protection again 
exposure to such hazardous materials, including 
Cal OSHA regulations. In addition, IRWD would be
 required to comply with all federal and state 
regulations pertaining to abatement or disposal
 of hazardous materials and wastes to protect 
public health and the environment. If necessary to
 protect worker health and safety, ACM would 
be removed prior to demolition of structures. No mitigation measures are necessary; impacts 

would be considered less than significant. 
Project construction would involve use of chemic
als and solvents such as fuel and lubricating 
grease for motorized heavy equipment. Inadvertent 
spills or releases of such hazardous materials 
into the environment could occur. As explaine
d in Section 3.8 Hydrology and Water Quality, 
IRWD would be required to prepare and impl
ement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan 
(SWPPP) for the project to protect water quality and prevent polluted runoff from leaving the 

project construction sites. The SWPPP would include BMPs for proper handling of chemicals, 
such as avoiding fueling at the construction 
site, avoiding overtopping during fueling, and 
installing containment pans. Implementation of 
Mitigation Measure HAZ-1 would ensure such BMPs are included as part of the SWPPP and would ensure proper handling of hazardous 
materials to reduce impacts associated with accide
ntal release to less than significant levels.

Final EIR 
April 2011 
Mitigation Measures 
HAZ-1: 
IRWD shall require the construction contractor to include the following BMPs in 
the SWPPP that would prevent the accidental rele
ase of hazardous materials. The plan shall 
include, but not be limited to, the following BMPS: 
 Follow manufacturers™ recommendations and regulatory requirements for use, storage, 
and disposal of chemical products and h
azardous materials used in construction. 
 During routine maintenance of construction 
equipment, properly contain and remove 
grease and oils.  Properly dispose of discarded containe
rs of fuels and other chemicals. 
 In the event of a petroleum product spill, the 
contractor shall contain the spill and clean 
up the contaminated area in compliance 
with regulations with DTSC and RWQCB approval. Contaminated soils shall be rem
oved and disposed of in accordance with 
applicable regulations. 
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.   Emergency Response Plan Impact 3.7-2: The proposed project could impair the implementation of, or physically 
interfere with, an adopted emergency response 
plan or emergency evacuation plan. (Less 
than Significant with Mitigation) 
Construction of the proposed project would no
t directly affect surrounding roadways. Active 
construction activities and staging would occur ons
ite at the Baker site, along the Serrano Creek 
Trail, through open space, at the existing Intertie facility, and at OC-33.
 No roadway or lane 
closures would occur and thus would not interfere
 with any emergency response plans. However, 
the delivery of construction materials and 
equipment could impede access for emergency 
response vehicles. The cities of Lake Forest and Orange each have an Emergency Preparedness 
Plan that establishes coordinated action plans for em
ergency situations. The closest fire station to 
the Baker WTP is two miles away, located at 23022 El
 Toro Road in Lake Forest. The closest fire 
station to the Raw Water Pump Station is one mile
 away, located at 7401 E. Fort Road in Orange. 
This fire station is also just over one mile
 away from OC-33. Implementation of Mitigation 
Measure TR-1, requiring a traffic control pl
an, and Mitigation Measure TR-3, requiring coordination with emergency service providers, w
ould reduce impacts to emergency response and 
access associated with construction traffic to a 
less than significant level. (See Section 3.12 Traffic and Transportation for Mitig
ation Measures TR-1 and TR-3.) 
Mitigation Measures 
Implement 
Mitigation Measures TR-1
 and TR-3. Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.   3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

Wildland Fires 
Impact 3.7-3: The proposed project could expo
se people and structures to a significant risk or loss, injury or death to wildland fires. (Less than Significant with Mitigation) 
The City of Lake Forest is subject to both wild and urban fires as its eastern portion is contiguous 
with the Cleveland National Forest. However, the proposed project area in the vicinity of the 
Baker site is not identified by the Lake Forest
 General Plan as having a high fire hazard rating 
(City of Lake Forest, 1994). 
 Portions of the City of Orange are subject to 
both wild and urban fires. The proposed Raw Water 
Pump Station would be located in an area that is
 identified by the Orange General Plan as having 
a very high fire hazard rating. The proposed project
 would be required to comply with the Orange 
Fire Department™s enforced fuel modification zones.
 In addition, OC-33 is in an area identified by 
Orange County as a very high fire hazard zone
. Implementation of Mitigation Measure HAZ-2 
would reduce potential impacts to people and struct
ures due to wildfires to a less than significant 
level by requiring implementation of best mana
gement practices during construction to minimize 
the potential for fires to start or to spread. Mitigation Measures 
HAZ-2:
 IRWD shall require the construction contractor to implement the following best 
management practices during c
onstruction of the Raw Water Pump Station and OC-33 
Meter Exchange to prevent wildland fires. 
 During construction, all staging areas, welding areas, or areas slated for development 
using spark-producing equipment shall be 
cleared of dried vegetation or other 
flammable material. 
 Any construction equipment that includes a 
spark arrestor shall be equipped with a 
spark arrestor in good working order. 
 All vehicles and crews working at the project
 site shall have access to functional fire 
extinguishers at all times. 
 Construction crews shall have a spotter 
during welding activities to look out for 
potentially dangerous s
ituations, including accidental sparks.  
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.

3.8 Hydrology and Water Quality 
This section describes local surface water a
nd groundwater resources and discusses regional 
water quality issues. This section also evaluates 
the proposed project™s potential impacts on water 
resources in the project area.  
Regional Setting The proposed project is located in
 the coastal area of Orange County in southern California. This 
region is characterized by warm summers, cool wi
nters, and highly seasonal rainfall. The lower 
reaches of rivers in the region are generally dry in the summer under natural conditions, as 
potential evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation. M
ean precipitation in the project vicinity is 
approximately 15 inches per year with 87 per
cent occurring within November through March 
(City of Lake Forest, 2008). 
The City of Lake Forest is located within th
e San Diego Creek and Aliso Creek watersheds (OC 
Watersheds, 2005). The Aliso Creek
 Watershed covers 30.4 square miles and the San Diego 
Creek Watershed covers 112.2 squa
re miles.  The Aliso Creek wate
rshed™s main drainage is Aliso 
Creek with smaller tributaries feeding into it th
at include Wood Canyon, Sulphur Creek, the Aliso 
Hills Channel, and the English Ch
annel. The San Diego Creek Wate
rshed™s main drainage is San 
Diego Creek which empties into Upper Newport 
Bay. Upper Newport Bay drains into Lower 
Newport Bay and then finally the Pacific Ocean. 
Figure 3.8-1 identifies major surface water 
resources in the region.  
The City of Orange is located within the Sa
nta Ana River and Westminster Watersheds (OC Watersheds, 2005; City of Orange, 2009). The Sa
nta Ana River Watershed covers 2,800 square 
miles and the Westminster Waters
hed covers 74.1 square miles. 
 The Westminster watershed is 
located in the southwestern corner of Orange County and is mostly urbanized and lies on a within 
the level coastal plain.  The Santa Ana River wa
tershed™s main drainage is the Santa Ana River 
which performs valuable flood control and groundwat
er recharge functions along its entire route. 
The Santa Ana River discharges to the Pacific O
cean in Newport Beach, north of Newport Bay.  
Project Area  Surface Water 
The Baker site and the proposed sewer pipelin
e are adjacent to Serrano Creek, a tributary to 
San Diego Creek. Serrano Creek flows directly in
to San Diego Creek, which then flows into 
Upper Newport Bay and the Pacific Ocean (Figure 3.8-1).

The proposed Raw Water Pump Station, Peters 
Canyon Reservoir, OC-33 and Irvine Lake are 
physically located within the Lower Santa Ana 
River watershed (City of Orange, 2009). The Raw 
Water Pump Station is adjacent and upslope of 
Peters Canyon Reservoir, which is connected to 
Santiago Creek by Handy Creek, a minor drainage course (EDAW, 2010) (Figure 3.8-1). OC-33 

is approximately 0.25 miles north of Santiago Creek
, which is a tributary to the Santa Ana River. 
Irvine Lake, which is upstream of OC-33 on San
tiago Creek, is formed by Santiago Dam, which 
is an earthfill structure. The dam is jointly ow
ned by IRWD and Serrano Irrigation District. Villa 
Park Dam is downstream of OC-33 on Santiago Creek.  
Surface Water Quality 
Section 303(d) of the CWA requires that each state identify water bodies or segments of water 

bodies that are ﬁimpairedﬂ (i.e. do not meet one or
 more of the water quality standards established 
by the state). These waters are identified in the 
Section 303(d) list as waters that are polluted and 
need further attention to support their beneficial
 uses. Once the water body or segment is listed, 
the state is required to establish Total Maximum 
Daily Load (TMDL) for the pollutant. A TMDL 
is the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet the water 

quality standards. Typically, TMDL is the sum of 
the allowable loads of a single pollutant from 
all contributing point and nonpoint sources.  
Reaches of San Diego Creek and Newport Bay have
 been listed (303(d)) as impaired by bacteria, 
pesticides, metals, toxics, sediment, and nutrien
ts. Primary causes of impairment identified are 
urban runoff and storm sewers and unknown no
npoint sources. Total Maximum Daily Loads 
(TMDLs) have been developed for sediment, nitrogen, phosphorous, chlropyrifos, and diazinon. 
TMDLs for other toxics have been developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US 

EPA); however the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) has not yet adopted them. 

Applicable water quality goals and limits are included in the Regional Basin Plan.  
Table 3.8-1 summarizes the impaired water bodies on the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality 
Control Board (SARWQCB) 2006 Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list near the proposed project 

components (SARWQCB, 2007). Serrano Creek, the clo
sest surface water to the Baker site, is an 
impaired water body. Reach 1 of Santiago Cr
eek, the closest surface water to the Raw Water 
Pump Station and OC-33, is not an impaired water body. 
Groundwater The Orange County Groundwater Basin is bounded 
on the north by the Puente and Chino Hills, 
on the east by Santa Ana Mountains, and on the south by the San Joaquin Hills, on the southwest 

by the Pacific Ocean, and on the northwest by a low topographic divide at the border of Orange 

and Los Angeles County. Underlying geology of 
the groundwater aquifer is a thick accumulation 
of fresh water-bearing interbedded marine and 
continental sand, silt and clay deposits. The 
proportion of fine materials increases from the 
mountain areas towards the coast, resulting in 
areas of recharge (forebay area) where materi
als are coarser and more interconnected, and 
pressure areas where materials are finer and the 
aquifer becomes confined. These consolidated

  rocks surround and underlie thick unconsolidated alluvial deposits. The major surface water 
drainage overlying this groundwater basin is Sa
nta Ana River, the headwaters of which lies outside the basin (City of Lake Forest, 2008). 
Groundwater levels in the basins have periodically declined due to gradually increasing groundwater production over the last ten years,
 and due to drought conditions, which have 
reduced the amount of local water available to 
refill the basin. To address these low groundwater 
levels and continuing seawater 
intrusion, the OCWD has reduced the amount of groundwater 
available to its water retailers and increased th
e cost of groundwater to pay for more imported 
water to recharge the basin. In addition to lowering the amount of groundwater use the OCWD is 

shifting the pumping in the basin inward away 
from the coast in order to forestall continued 
seawater intrusion (OCWD 2003) (City of Lake Forest, 2008). 
Flooding  During the 100-year storm event, some flooding 
is expected along Serrano Creek, Aliso Creek,  
Borrego Canyon Wash, and Santiago Creek. In the vi
cinity of the Baker site, Serrano Creek is 
designated as Zone AO, which would be subject to 
flooding at depths of 1 to 3 feet in a 100-year 
storm. Generally, watercourses in the vicinity 
of the Baker WTP are incised and have high 
enough banks or have been channelized to cont
ain most of the 100-year flood events. The 
additional flow from the 500-year storm results in a slight increase of flooded areas (City of Lake 

Forest, 2006). The OC-33 site is not within the 100-year flood zone for Santiago Creek.

Federal 
Clean Water Act 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.
S.C. 1251 et. sec.) as amended by the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 19
72, also known as the Clean Water Act (CWA), 
states that the discharge of pollutants to waters
 of the United States from any point source is 
unlawful, unless the discharge is in compliance w
ith a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination 
System (NPDES) permit. Amendments (1987) to
 the CWA added a section which established a 
framework for regulating municipal and indust
rial (M&I) storm water discharges under the 
NPDES program. On November 16, 1990, the United States Environmental Protection Agency 

(USEPA) published final regulations, under th
e 1987 CWA Amendments, that establish application requirements for storm water permits. 
These regulations require that discharges of 
storm water from construction activity of five acres 
or more must be regulated as an industrial 
activity and covered by a NPDES permit.   
NPDES Phase I  
Phase I of the NPDES Program addresses ten cat
egories of industrial activities; construction 
activities disturbing five acres of land or great
er; and storm water runoff from ﬁmediumﬂ and 
ﬁlargeﬂ municipal separate storm 
sewer systems (MS4s) generally serving populations of 100,000 
or greater.  For construction activities disturbing five acres of land or greater, the SWRCB issued one statewide General Construction Activity Storm Wate
r Permit (on August 20, 1992) to apply to all 
construction activities. This permit was revised a
nd reissued on August 19, 1999 (Water Quality 
Order 99-08-DWQ). Landowners are responsible for 
obtaining and complying with this permit 
but may delegate specific duties to develope
rs and contractors by mutual consent. For 
construction activities, the permit requires la
ndowners, or their designated agent, to: 
 Eliminate or reduce non-storm water discharges 
to storm water systems and other waters 
of the United States, 
 Develop and implement a SWPPP, and 
 Perform inspections of storm water control 
structures and pollution prevention measures. 
A SWPPP prepared in compliance with the General Permit describes the site, erosion and 
sediment controls, runoff water quality monitoring, means of waste disposal, implementation of 

approved local plans, control of post-construc
tion sediment and erosion control measures and 
maintenance responsibilities, and non-storm water 
management controls. 
Dischargers are also required to inspect construction sites before and 
after storms to identify storm water discharge 
from construction activity, and to identify 
and implement controls where necessary.

NPDES Phase II 
Phase II of the NPDES Program further protects and improves the nation™s water resources from 
polluted storm water runoff by focusing on urba
n storm water runoff from additional MS4s in 
urbanized area and the operations of small constr
uction sites are were not already covered by 
Phase I NPDES permits. On December 8, 1999 the SWRCB amended Water Quality Order 99-

08-DWQ to apply to construction sites of one acre or greater, and NPDES Phase II 

regulations were finalized and issued by the USEPA in
 January 2000. The main objectives of the 
Phase II regulations are to reduce the amount of pollutants being discharged and protect the 

quality of the receiving waters. 
To meet this goal, the permittee must implement a Stormwater Management Program that 
addresses six minimum control measures, including
 (1) public education and outreach; (2) public participation/involvement; (3) illicit discharge det
ection and elimination; (4) construction site 
storm water runoff control for sites greater th
an one acre; (5) post-construction storm water 
management in new development and rede
velopment; and (6) pollution prevention/good 
housekeeping for municipal operations. These contro
l measures will typically be addressed by 
developing BMPs. 
Federal Emergency Management Agency  
Under Executive Order 11988, the Federal Em
ergency Management Agency (FEMA) is 
responsible for the management and mapping of areas subject to flooding during a 100-year flood 

event (i.e., one percent chance of occurring in
 a given year). FEMA requires that local 
governments covered by federal flood insuran
ce pass and enforce a floodplain management 
ordinance that specifies minimum requirements for any construction within the 100-year flood 

plain.  
State Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act 
The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act 
(Division 7 of the California Water Code) 
provides the basis for water quality regulation within
 California. This act establishes the authority 
of the SWRCB and the nine RWQCBs. The SWRCB administers water rights, water pollution 

control, and water quality functions throughout 
the state, while the RWQCBs conduct planning, 
permitting, and enforcement activities. The project area lies within the jurisdiction of the 

SARWQCB. The SARWQCB regulates discharges incl
uding storm water discharges to waters of 
the state through the issuance of Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs). 
SWRCB Anti-Degradation Policy 
The SWRCB Resolution No. 82-16 ﬁStatement of 
Policy with Respect to Maintaining High 
Quality Water in Californiaﬂ is California™s im
plementation of the Clean Water Act (40 CFR 
131.6; 131.12(a)). The SWRCB policy requires the continued maintenance of existing high 

quality water unless there is a demonstration that: 
(1) allowing some degradation is consistent 
with the maximum benefit to the people of the state; and (2) that such degradation would not

unreasonably affect existing or potential benefi
cial use. The policy requires a constituent-by-
constituent comparison to determine water qua
lity changes for the proposed project.   
Santa Ana River Basin Water Quality Control Plan 
The SWRCB and the SARWQCB share the responsibility, under the Porter-Cologne Act, to 
formulate and adopt water policies and plans a
nd to adopt and implement measures to fulfill 
CWA requirements. The SARWQCB has prepared
 the Santa Ana River Basin Water Quality 
Control Plan (Basin Plan) (2008) that identifies bene
ficial uses for the major creeks and washes in 
the project area as shown in 
Table 3.8-2
. Table 3.8-3 defines the identified beneficial uses. 
NPDES General Construction Permit for Storm Water Runoff 
Construction activities of one acre or more are regulated by the SWRCB and are subject to the 
permitting requirements of the NPDES General 
Permit for Discharges of Storm Water Runoff 
Associated with Construction Activity (Gen
eral Construction Permit). The SWRCB has the authority to implement the federal CWA NPDES Phase I and Phase II program. The SWRCB 

reissued the General Construction Permit (WQO 
2009-0009-DWQ), which became effective July 
1, 2010. The project applicant must submit a Noti
ce of Intent (NOI) to the RWQCB to be covered 
by the General Permit prior to the beginning of
 construction. The Gene
ral Construction Permit 
requires the preparation and implementation of a SWPPP. The SWPPP must be prepared before 

project construction begins and must include speci
fications for BMPs that would be implemented 
during construction. (BMPs are measures undertaken
 to control degradation of surface water by 
preventing soil erosion or the discharge of pollutants from the construction area). Additionally, 

the SWPPP must describe measures to prevent or 
control runoff after construction is complete 
and to identify procedures for inspecting, main
taining, and monitoring BMP facilities or other 
project elements.  
The new General Construction Permit (WQO 2009-0
009-DWQ) that became effective July 1, 
2010 initiates a new risk-based permitting approach th
at considers both risk of sedimentation and 
risk to receiving waters due to project construction. A Risk Assessment is required that considers 
both parameters and assigns a risk level to each pr
oject, ranging from Risk Level 1 to Risk Level 
3. The requirements for BMPs, visual monitoring, effluent monitoring, and Rain Event Action 

Plans, among other things, depend on a project™s 
risk level. The new permit also details the 
training, education, and/or certifications require
d for persons responsible for conducting the Risk 
Assessment, preparing the NOI, preparing the SW
PPP, conducting sampling and monitoring, etc. 
The proposed project would affect more than 
one acre during construction and therefore would 
require preparation of a Risk Assessment, NOI, 
and SWPPP. Required elements of a SWPPP include: 
 Site description addressing the elements a
nd characteristics specific to the site,  
 Descriptions of BMPs for erosion and sediment controls,  
 BMPs for construction waste handling and disposal, 
 Proposed post-construction controls, and  
 Procedures for monitoring BMP performance.

Sections 1601-1616 require application to the CD
FG to obtain a Streambed Alteration Agreement 
(SAA). This agreement is not considered a discre
tionary permit subject to CEQA; instead, it is a 
negotiated agreement between CDFG and the applicant. The agreement may contain mitigation 
measures, such as erosion control, intended to redu

to assess the effectiveness of the proposed
 mitigation(s) related to the activity.  
Local  
Orange County Stormwater Program 
Since 1990, operators of municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) are required to develop 
a stormwater management program designed to 
prevent harmful pollutants from impacting water 
resources via stormwater runoff.  In Orange Count
y, storm water and urban runoff enter the storm 
water system from streets, curbs and gutters and tr
avel, untreated to local water bodies and/or the 
Pacific Ocean.  
As an MS4 operator, Orange County must obt
ain and implement NPDES permits for both the 
Santa Ana (SAR) and San Diego (SDR) Regional Water Quality Control Board regions. The 
proposed project is located in the SARWQCB re
gion. The Orange County Stormwater Program 
(Program) is a cooperative of the County of 
Orange, Orange County Flood Control District 
(OCFCD) and all 34 Orange County cities including 
Lake Forest and Orange. As the Principal Permittee on both the SAR and SDR NPDES pe
rmits, the County guides development and 
implementation of the Program, collaborating regul
arly with Co-Permittees to ensure compliance 
and prevent ocean pollution. NPDES permits are issued for a five-year term a
nd have generally followed a progressive pattern. 
The First Term (est. 1990) permit provided an opp
ortunity for Orange County municipalities to 
establish a program customized to local conditions
. In its earliest form, the Program focused on 
gathering data about existing c
onditions and implementing an initial set of improvement measures 
aimed at known water quality deficiencies.  Issu
ed in 1996, the Second Term permit built upon 
the knowledge gained during the First Term and 
aimed to improve water quality incrementally 
over time. During this period, Orange County invest
ed heavily in parallel efforts to implement a 
watershed approach, a comprehensive but lengt
hy planning tool for addressing water quality as 
well as habitat restoration, recreation, and flood 
control.  Program developments in the Third 
Term permit (est. 2003) lead to successful Dry Weather Reconnaissance and monitoring 

programs, a diverse and recognizable public
 education campaign and other significant 
advancements. 
In May and December, 2009, the SAR and SDR Bo
ards, respectively, adopted the Fourth Term 
NPDES permits for Orange County.  Looking fo
rward, the Orange County Permittees are striving 
to modify existing and develop new Program elemen
ts to comply with the newly adopted Fourth 
Term permits.

Drainage Area Management Plan (DAMP) a
nd Water Quality Management Plans (WQMPs) 
The specific water pollution control elements of
 the Orange County Stormwater Program are 
documented in the Drainage Area Management Plan (DAMP), which is the Permittees™ primary 

policy, planning and implementation document
 for municipal NPDES Stormwater Permit 
compliance. The main objective of the DAMP is 
to fulfill the commitment of the Permittees to 
develop and implement a program that sa
tisfies NPDES permit requirements. The DAMP 
provides a foundation for the Orange County Stormwater Permittees to implement model 

programs designed to prevent pollutants from entering receiving waters to the maximum extent 

practicable. The description and detail of how this 
is accomplished on a local level is contained in 
a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) that is devel
oped by each city (including Lake Forest and 
Orange) and the County. The LIP is designed to 
work in conjunction with the DAMP and is 
specific to each jurisdiction. The LIPs implem
ent the various programs of the DAMP, such as 
inspection of industrial and commercial busin
esses, construction projects, new development 
projects, and illegal discharges/illicit connections. 
The DAMP requires that all new development and significant redevelopment projects incorporate 
appropriate Site Design, Source Control, and Treatment Control Best Management Practices 

(BMPs) to address specific water quality issues.
 The DAMP also requires the preparation of 
Water Quality Management Plans (WQMPs) for 
all development/redevelopment projects in 
accordance with the local jurisdic
tion™s LIP. The WQMP requires identification of BMPs that 
mitigate any potential impacts to receiving waters, 
such as site design BMPs, routine structural 
and non-structural BMPs, and long-term operation an
d maintenance plans for all structural BMPs. 
IRWD would be required to prepare a WQMP for the proposed project.

Significance Criteria 
The criteria used to determine the significance of
 impacts related to hydrology and water quality 
are based on Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines. The proposed project would result in a 
significant impact to hydrology or water quality if it would:  
 Violate any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements; 
 Substantially deplete groundwater supplies or
 interfere substantially with groundwater 
recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the 

local groundwater table level;

tantial additional sources of polluted runoff; 
 Otherwise substantially degrade water quality; 
 Place housing within a 100-year flood ha
zard area as mapped on a federal Flood Hazard 
Boundary or Flood Insurance Rate Map or 
other authoritative flood hazard delineation map; 
 Place within a 100-year flood hazard area structures that would impede or redirect flood 
flows;  Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving 
flooding, including flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam; 
 Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving 
inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow. 
Impacts Discussion 
Groundwater Supply and Recharge 
Implementation of the proposed project would not 
involve or result in any new withdrawals of 
groundwater. The infiltration of precipitation to 
the groundwater table is currently limited by the 
presence of existing impervious surfaces at the Baker 
site and Intertie facility at Peters Canyon 
Reservoir. Construction of the proposed project 
potentially would create new impervious surfaces 
at these project sites. However, the area of reduced infiltration would not be of sufficient size to 
effectively lower the groundwater table.  
The proposed treated water pipeline and sewer pipeline would include installation of a 24-inch 
and 15-inch underground pipeline, respectively,
 the installation of which would require soil 
compaction around the pipe. The pipeline and compacted soil surrounding it could reduce the 

infiltration rate of water along the pipeline route.
 However, the area of reduced infiltration would not be of sufficient size to effectively lower th
e groundwater table. There would be no impact. 
The OC-33 Meter Exchange includes replacement 
of an existing pipeline segment. The proposed project would reestablish the existing soil compaction around the new pipeline segment. There 

would be no impact to infiltration or the groundwater table. 
Levee or Dam Failure 
The proposed project would not expose people or stru
ctures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or 
death involving flooding due to failure of a levee or dam. The aboveground vault structures at

OC-33 are downstream of Santiago Dam and Irvin
e Lake on Santiago Creek. However, OC-33 is 
an existing facility, and the proposed project woul
d not introduce any new structures that would be at a risk of loss due to failure of the dam.
 The remaining project components are not located 
downstream of a levee or dam nor would they in
volve construction or other activities that would 
alter the stability of any levee or dam, or any other flood control structure. There would be no 

impact.  
100-Year Flood Hazard Areas  
The Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) produ
ced by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) indicate areas prone to flood h
azards due to major storm events, including 
100-year and 500-year flood zones. According to the FIRMs, none of the proposed project 

components would be located within a 100-year flood hazard area, with the exception of the 

emergency overflow facility into Serrano Creek
. (FEMA, 2004; City of Lake Forest, 2006; 
County of Orange, 2005). This 
facility would be designed to 
withstand scouring and erosion-
related forces due to flood flows within the cr
eek. In addition, the proposed project would not 
involve the construction of any ho
using. Therefore, the proposed project would not expose people 
or structures to significant loss, injury, or death due to flooding.  
Seiche, Tsunami and Mudflow Exposure 
The proposed Baker WTP, sewer pipeline, and treated
 water pipeline in the City of Lake Forest 
would be approximately 11 miles from the Pacific Ocean. The Raw Water Pump Station in the 

City of Orange would be approximately 15 miles from the Pacific Ocean. The OC-33 site is 

approximately 16 miles from the Pacific Ocean. None of the project components would pose a 

significant risk to people or structures due to tsunamis. There would be no impacts.  
The proposed project would be located primarily 
in areas characterized by flat topography, with 
the exception of OC-33. None of the project 
components are in areas that are prone to 
liquefaction or landslides. Therefore, none of 
the project components would pose a significant 
risk to people or structures due to mudflows. There would be no impact. 
The proposed Baker WTP, treated water pipeline, 
and sewer pipeline are approximately 7.8 miles 
from Lake Irvine, which is not close enough to be
 affected by a seiche. Similarly, OC-33 is 
location approximately 1.5 miles from Irvine Lake
, which is not close enough to be affected by a 
seiche. The proposed Raw Water Pump Station would be approximately 400 feet from the Peter 

Canyon Reservoir which is sufficiently far enough to be out of any risk of inundation by seiche 

waves. There would be no impact.   
Water Quality Standards 
Impact 3.8-1: Construction and operation of
 the proposed project could violate water 
quality standards or waste discharge requirements. (Less than Significant)

Construction 
Construction of the proposed project components 
would require site grading, excavation, and 
trenching. Areas of bare soil would be exposed 
to erosive forces for prolonged periods of time 
and could result in increased erosion. Erosi
on of stockpiled soils and release of hazardous 
materials used during construc
tion could adversely affect su
rface water and groundwater. 
Construction activities involve the use and handling 
of chemicals such as, but not limited to, oils, 
fuels, and lubricants. In the event of accidental release of such chemicals, such as spills during 
fueling of equipment or vehicles, the chemicals 
could come into contact with storm water runoff 
and flow into nearby waters of the U.S., thus a
ffecting surface water quality, and/or absorbed into 
the soil and affect groundwater quality.  
Section 402 of the federal Clean Water Act 
established the National Pollutant Discharge 
Elimination System (NPDES) to regulate dischar
ges into navigable waters of the U.S. The 
SWRCB issues NPDES permits in the State of Calif
ornia, including non-point source permits to 
control urban storm water runoff. To expedite
 the application for NPDES permits, the SWRCB 
has developed statewide general storm water pe
rmits. The NPDES General Permit for Discharges 
of Storm Water Associated with Construction Ac
tivity (General Construction Permit) (Order No. 
2009-0009-DWQ) applies to construction sites gr
eater than one acre, from which storm water 
runoff discharges into waters of the U.S. IRWD w
ould be required to submit a Notice of Intent to 
comply with the statewide NPDES General Construction Permit and prepare a SWPPP since the 

construction areas would be greater than one acre 
in size and would affect waters of the U.S., 
namely Serrano Creek, San Diego Creek, Santiago Creek, and the Santa Ana River. The SWPPP 

would include BMPs to control erosion, sedimen
tation, and hazardous materials release from the 
construction sites into surface waters. Complian
ce with the SWPPP BMPs and other federal and 
state regulations would ensure impacts to wate
r quality from construction activities are less than 
significant.  Construction of the proposed treated water pipe
line and sewer pipeline would require excavation 
up to 12 feet deep. The depth to groundwater in the vicinity of the proposed pipeline is expected 

to be deeper than 20 feet below ground surf
ace per the results of preliminary geotechnical 
investigations. Therefore, construction of the 
proposed pipeline would not require groundwater 
dewatering or discharge. No waste discharge 
requirements or dewatering permits would be 
required.  
Operation 
The proposed project would be subject to m
unicipal NPDES Stormwater regulations for discharges to waters of U.S. associated with proj
ect operation. As the operator of the countywide 
municipal storm drain system, Orange County is the Principal Permittee for the municipal 

NPDES Stormwater Permit issued by the SARWQC
B, which has jurisdiction over the proposed project. The proposed project would be required to be designed in accordance with the Orange 

County Stormwater Program and DAMP, which is
 the primary implementation document for the 
municipal NPDES Stormwater Permit, along with
 the associated LIPs for each city and the 
County. The DAMP would require IRWD to prepar
e a WQMP that identifies all BMPs necessary

to mitigate any potential impacts to receiving waters
, such as site design BMPs, routine structural and non-structural BMPs, and long-term operation an
d maintenance plans for all structural BMPs. 
Such BMPs may include detention of storm wa
ter to capture runoff during first-flush storm 
events or collection and pretreatment of runoff 
prior to discharge to the municipal storm drain 
system. Implementation of BMPs in accordan
ce with the project™s approved WQMP would 
ensure that operation of the proposed project w
ould not violate water quality standards or waste 
discharge requirements. Impacts would be less than significant. 
Mitigation Measures
 None required. 
 Drainage Impact 3.8-2: The proposed project could subs
tantially alter the existing drainage pattern of a site or area through the alteration of the course of a stream or a river that would increase the rate or amount of surface runoff 
in a manner that would result in flooding, 
erosion, or siltation on or off site. (Less than Significant with Mitigation) 
Construction of the proposed Baker WTP, Raw Wa
ter Pump Station, and OC-33 Meter Exchange 
would primarily occur at sites that are currently 
developed with existing water treatment facilities. 
The proposed project may increase the amount of 
impervious surfaces at these project sites. 
However, the proposed project would not change s
ubstantially the drainage patterns of the sites 
and therefore would not result in substantial erosion or surface runoff. The design of the proposed 
facilities would include specifications for installa
tion of gutters and drainage ditches to direct 
surface runoff into channels that connect to th
e storm drain systems in accordance with Orange 
County Stormwater Program, DAMP and LIPs for each city and the County. These programs 

require implementation of storm water control measures that protect receiving waters and 

minimize the transport of pollutants from project sites. Therefore, with implementation of these 

regulatory requirements, impacts 
would be less than significant. The proposed Baker WTP includes an Emergency 
Overflow Facility that would discharge raw 
water to Serrano Creek through a 42-inch pipeline.
 Although expected to occur infrequently, if at 
all, the proposed project could discharge up to
 54 cfs of raw water into Serrano Creek. Serrano 
Creek has sufficient capacity to
 accommodate this flow at this location. The raw water would 
originate either from the forebay or the chlorine 
contact basin.  The overflow would only occur in 
the unlikely event of a malfunction from either 
one of the valves associated with these facilities. Other valves upstream would then be utilized to 
shut off these overflows, or coordination with 
MWD would occur to shut off flows to the Bake
r WTP. In a worst case scenario the discharge of 
overflows would only occur for a period of several hours. The discharge structure would include 

flow-control features, such as concrete or rip-rap,
 to dissipate energy of the flows and minimize 
the potential for erosion in the creek. In add
ition, the proposed Emergency Overflow Facility 
would be permitted by the SARWQCB under an existi
ng discharge permit held by IRWD or as an

addendum or amendment to the permit. Permit 
requirements would include regulatory approval 
of the design and proposed discharge protocol
s prior to any discharges into Serrano Creek. 
Therefore, based on the infrequent and relatively short duration of these emergency discharges 
combined with the regulatory requirements for th
e design of the discharge structure, the potential 
impacts to Serrano Creek would be less than significant.  
The proposed treated water pipeline and sewer
 pipeline would be located below ground and 
would not include any surface structures other th
an minor pipeline appurtenances. Installation of 
the proposed pipeline would not alter existing drai
nage patterns of the sites. Implementation of 
Mitigation Measure AES-2 would require surface r
estoration along the pipeline alignment. The 
completed pipeline would not result in substantia
l flooding onsite or offsite. Impacts would be 
less than significant.  Mitigation Measures
 Implement 
Mitigation Measure AES-2
. Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.  Storm Water Impact 3.8-3: The proposed project could 
potentially contribute or create runoff water 
which would exceed the capacity of existing 
or planned storm water drainage systems or 
provide sources of polluted runoff. (Less than Significant) Implementation of the proposed Baker WTP a
nd Raw Water Pump Station potentially would 
increase the amount of impervious surfaces at e
ach project site. However, the additional impervious surfaces would cover a relatively 
small area that would not cause a significant 
decrease in overall soil permeability. In addition,
 the proposed improvements would be required 
to adhere to the local (either City of Orange 
or Orange County for elements located in Lake 
Forest) storm water requirements.  Implementa
tion of required storm water control measures 
would minimize offsite flows and include measures 
to ensure that capacities of drainage systems 
are adequate for large storm events. As a resu
lt, the proposed facilities would not result in an increase in flooding or erosion and would not resu
lt in runoff that would exceed the capacity of 
local storm drains. The local storm water requirements also include measures that minimize 

pollutants from being transported offsite.    
Implementation of the proposed treated water 
pipeline and sewer pipeline would result in soil 
compaction around the underground pipe that could reduce the permeability of the soil. However, 

soil compaction would occur in a relatively small 
area that would not cause a substantial decrease 
in soil permeability. The OC-33 Meter Exchange
 includes replacement of an existing pipeline 
segment. The proposed project would reestablish the existing soil compaction around the new 

pipeline segment. As a result, the proposed pipe
lines would not result in an increase in flooding

or erosion and would not result in runoff that would exceed the capacity of local storm drains. 
Therefore the pipeline would not substantially de
grade water quality. Impacts would be less than 
significant. Mitigation Measures
 None required.

3.9 Land Use, Planning, and Recreation 
This section describes the existing land uses and r
ecreational resources in the vicinity of the 
proposed project and evaluates potential impacts a
ssociated with implementation of the proposed 
project. The section describes the regulations that govern land use and recreational lands, including zoning ordinances and general plan policies.  

Regional Setting The proposed project is located within the City of Lake Forest, City of Orange, and County of 

Orange, California. Orange County is located
 along the Pacific Ocean, and is bounded by 
Los Angeles County to the north and northwest, San Bernardino County to the northeast, 

Riverside County to the east, and San Diego County to the southeast. A somewhat rectangular 

landmass, Orange County stretches approximately 
40 miles along the coast and extends inland 
approximately 20 miles, covering 798 square mil
es. Orange County includes 34 cities and has a 
population of 2.94 million residents. The unincor
porated territory, consisting of approximately 
321 square miles, is geographically diverse w
ith unincorporated areas spread throughout the county (Orange County, 2008) 
Project Area Setting Land Use and Zoning 
The land use and zoning designations for the project components are shown in 
Table 3.9-1
. Land 
uses in the project area are under the jurisdiction of the City of Orange, City of Lake Forest, and 

County of Orange and are based on the 
cities™ and County™s General Plans.

April 2011 
The Baker site is located in the City of Lake
 Forest, near the intersection of Wisteria and 
Palmwood. The Baker site is already deve
loped as a public utilities facility. The land use 
designation at the Baker site is Public Facility
 (City of Lake Forest, 2008a), and the zoning 
designation is General Agriculture (A
1) (City of Lake Forest, 2008b).  
The proposed sewer pipeline would be located w
ithin an existing 15-foot utility easement along 
the Serrano Creek Trail in the City of Lake Fo
rest™s Serrano Creek Park. The current land use 
designation for the sewer pipeline is Regional Pa
rk/Open Space (City of Lake Forest, 2008b), and 
the zoning designation is Open Space (City of Lake Forest, 2010).  
A new pipeline may be required to convey tr
eated water from the Baker WTP to the South 
County Pipeline. The corridor for this potential 
pipeline would run from the Baker WTP through 
primarily open space lands adjacent to residential 
areas. Two pipeline alignment options are being 
considered. The corridor for Option 1 includes la
nd use designations for Public Facilities, Low-
Medium Density Residential, and Low Density 
Residential. The corridor for Option 2 includes 
land use designation for Public Facilities and Low-
Medium Density Residential. Both treated 
water pipeline options would begin at the Bake
r site, which is zoned General Agriculture. 
Pipeline Option 1 would run through lands zone
d for High Density Residential and Medium 
Density Residential. Pipeline Option 2 woul
d run through lands zoned for High Density 
Residential only (Table 3.9-1). 
 The proposed Raw Water Pump Station would be 
located near Peters Canyon Reservoir in the 
City of Orange, at the site of the existing Ba
ker/Irvine Lake Pipeline Intertie facilities. The 
proposed pump station would be located on land
 currently owned by the Santiago Aqueduct 
Commission (SAC), of which IRWD is a member. The proposed pump station would be located 

on land designated as Open Park Space and zone
d Recreation Open Space (Table 3.9-1).  
The proposed OC-33 Meter Exchange would be lo
cated within an existing SAC utility easement 
within Irvine Regional Park. The current land 
use designation for OC-33 is Open Space (County 
of Orange, 2005), and the zoning designation is
 General Agriculture (County of Orange, 2005). 
Sensitive Receptors Some land uses are considered more sensitive to 
ambient noise levels than others because of the 
amount of noise exposure (in terms of both e
xposure duration and insulation from noise) and the 
types of activities typically involved. Residences, hotels, schools, rest homes, and hospitals are 

generally more sensitive to noise than commercia
l and industrial land uses. Sensitive receptors 
near the Baker site include the neighboring resi
dential areas to the east, south, and west. The 
treated water pipeline alignments and the sewer pipe
line are in close proximity to residential land 
uses. There are no sensitive receptors in close pr
oximity to the Raw Water Pump Station. The 
closest sensitive receptors are residential land uses approximately 0.25 miles north of the 

proposed pump station site.

Recreational Facilities City of Lake Forest 
The Lake Forest Parks and Recreation Division 
is located at City Hall, 25550 Commercentre 
Drive. The Lake Forest Parks and Recreation Division is committed to providing residents of all 
ages positive experiences through a variety of 
high-quality programs, activities, and services 
under the direction of professional and dedicated 
staff who are responsive to the changing needs 
of the community. 
The City of Lake Forest has many public parks,
 lakes, and urban forests. Thus, Lake Forest 
residents enjoy a variety of parks and trails w
ith different amenities. Approximately 200 acres of 
public city parkland and recreational facilities have
 been developed within the City of Lake 
Forest. These 200 acres of parkland consist of a 
total of twenty-nine parks and recreational 
facilities. Private parks are also distributed thro
ughout the City in various planned community 
developments. (City of Lake Forest, 2008c) 
Serrano Creek Park is located at 25101 Serrano Road 
and is adjacent to the Baker site to the east 
and south. This 44-acre park includes restrooms, one
 playground, a walking trail, and three picnic 
tables.  Serrano Park is located at the intersection of Tamarisk and Peachwood, approximately 0.3 miles 
west of the Baker site. This 11.2-acre park includes ball fields for soccer and open play along 
with a basketball court and picnic tables.  County of Orange 
Peters Canyon Regional Park is located at 8548 
E. Canyon View Avenue. This park encompasses 
354 acres of riparian, freshwater marsh, grassland ha
bitats, and offers a variety of graded roads 
and trails for hikers, mountain bikers, and 
equestrians. The 55-acre Upper Peter Canyon 
Reservoir is home to many residents and migr
ating waterfowl. Willows, sycamores and black 
cottonwoods line the lake and Peters Canyon Creek
 which meanders through the canyon (Orange 
County Parks, 2010). 
The OC-33 site is located within the 477-acre Irvine Regional Park. Park activities include hiking 
and multi-use trails, ball fields, pl
aygrounds, picnic areas, band she
ll, nature center, pony rides, 
and a horseshoe pit (Orange County Parks, 2010b)
. Santiago Creek flows through the southern 
portion of the park. OC-33 is accessed via an 
unimproved roadway within the park, with access 
restricted by a locked gate.

Significance Criteria 
The criteria used to determine the significance of
 impacts related to land use and recreation are 
based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines. The proposed project would result in a significant 
impact if it would: 
 Physically divide an established community. 
 Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with 
jurisdiction over the project (including, but not limited to the general plan, specific plan, 

local coastal program, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or 

mitigating an environmental effect. 
 Conflict with any applicable habitat conserva
tion plan or natural community conservation 
plan. 
 Increase the use of existing neighborhood a
nd regional parks or other recreational 
facilities such that substantial physical dete
rioration of the facility would occur or be 
accelerated. 
 Include recreational facilities or require the construction or expansion of recreational facilities which might have an adverse 
physical effect on the environment. 
Impacts Discussion 
The following is a discussion of the potential eff
ects of the proposed project to land use and 
recreation according to the key issue areas identified in Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines.  Divide an Established Community 
The proposed Baker WTP would be constructed onsite and replace the existing BFP. The 
proposed Raw Water Pump Station would be cons
tructed onsite and replace the existing Intertie facility. The proposed meter exchange and pipelin
e replacement at the OC-33 site would be constructed onsite and replace existing facility. Th
ese project components are not linear features 
and would not divide an established community. In
 addition, the proposed Baker WTP is directly 
adjacent to a residential community to the sout
hwest. The presence of the Baker WTP would not 
preclude implementation of future developmen
t projects, such as Serrano Summit to the 
northeast, which would eventually surround the Bake
r WTP with residential and civic land uses. 
The proposed project would not affect th
e establishment of future communities.  
The proposed treated water pipeline and sewer pi
peline would be entirely underground with some 
above-ground appurtenances and would not create a 
barrier or physically divide an established 
community. There would be no impact.

Habitat Conservation Plan 
The City of Lake Forest is located within
 Orange County which ha
s an approved Natural 
Community Conservation Program/Habitat Conservation Plan (NCCP/HCP). The proposed Baker 

WTP, treated water pipeline, and sewer pipeline 
would be located within
 Non-Reserve Lands in 
the Central Subarea of the NCCP/HCP. There are no Reserve lands located within the boundaries 
of the City of Lake Forest. The proposed Baker WTP and pipelines would not conflict with the 

NCCP/HCP. There would be no impacts. 
The proposed Raw Water Pump Station and OC-
33 Meter Exchange would be located within 
Reserve Lands of the Orange County NCCP/HCP
; however construction activities would be 
conducted within a fenced, previously develope
d area and therefore would not conflict with 
preservation requirements set forth by the NCCP/HCP. There would be no impact.  
Existing Neighborhood Parks The proposed project would be limited to the c
onstruction of the Baker WTP, treated water 
pipeline, sewer pipeline, Raw Water Pump Stati
on, and OC-33 Meter Exchange. As described in 
Chapter 5, Growth Inducement, the proposed 
project would not build new homes or businesses 
and would not have a direct or indirect impact 
on population growth in the project area. As such, 
the proposed project would not result in the increased use of regional parks and recreational 
facilities that would cause accelerated deterioration. The proposed project would not require 

construction of additional recr
eational facilities that could have adverse effects on the 
environment. There would be no impact. 
Land Use Plans, Policies, Regulations 
Impact 3.9-1: Implementation of the proposed
 project could conflict with applicable land use plans, policies, or regulations. (Less than Significant) 
The land use designation for the Baker site is P
ublic Facilities (Table 3.9-1). The proposed Baker 
WTP would be consistent with 
this land use designation, which allows public utility land uses. 
The City zoning designation for the proposed Ba
ker WTP is General Agriculture (A1), which allows for agriculture, outdoor recreational uses, and low-intensity uses that have a predominantly 
open space character. Per Section 9.10.030 of the La
ke Forest Zoning Code, public/private utility 
buildings and structures are permitted in an A1 z
one subject to a site development permit. Water 
treatment facilities are not subject to city zoni
ng regulations, per Government Code 53091, and therefore a site development permit would not
 be required. Impacts would be less than 
significant. The proposed treated water pipeline corri
dors are designated as Low-Medium Density 
Residential, Low Density Residential, and Public
 Facilities (Table 3.9-1). The pipeline would be 
consistent with these land use designations, which allow for living accommodations as well as 
complementary land uses such as public facilities.
 The proposed pipeline would be compatible 
with residential land uses as it would provide a pub
lic utility. The City zoning designation for the 
proposed pipeline corridors include General Agricu
lture, High Density Residential, and Medium

Density Residential. Per Sections 9.10.030, 9.
44.030, and 9.56.030 of the Lake Forest Zoning 
Code, public/private utility buildings and structur
es are permitted in these zones subject to a site 
development permit. Water transmission facilities ar
e not subject to city zoning regulation, per 
Government Code 53091, and therefore a site de
velopment permit would not be required. Impacts 
would be less than significant. 
The land use designation for the proposed sewer 
pipeline is Regional Park/Open Space and the 
zoning designation is Open Space (Table 3.9-1). 
The City of Lake Forest Land Use Element does 
not state whether public facilities are compatible with land uses designated as Regional 

Park/Open Space. Per Section 9.16.030 of the Lake Forest Z
oning Code, public/private utility 
buildings and structures are permitted in an Op
en Space zone subject to a site development 
permit. Water and wastewater transmission faciliti
es are not subject to city building or zoning 
ordinances, per Government Code 53091, and ther
efore a site development permit would not be 
required. Impacts would be less than significant. 
The site for the proposed Raw Water Pump Station 
is designated as Open Space Park (Table 3.9-1).
1 This designation allows for passive and active recreation. The proposed pump station would replace 
the existing Intertie facility and 
thus would be located onsite at 
an existing public water utility 
facility and would not confliction with the land 
use at the site. The proposed Raw Water Pump 
Station site is zoned as Recreation Open Space. 
Per Section 17.22.030 of 
the Orange Zoning Code, public/private utility build
ings and structures are permitted in 
a Recreation Open Space zone subject to a conditional use permit. Water transmission fac
ilities are not subject to city zoning ordinances, 
per Government Code 53091, and th
erefore a conditional use permit would not be required. Impacts 
would be less than significant. 
The site for the proposed OC-33 Mater Exchange is
 designated as Open Space (Table 3.9-1). This 
designation allows for land uses that do not require 
a commitment of significant urban infrastructure. 
The proposed meter and pipeline exchange would replace existing water utility facilities comprised 
of minimal infrastructure and would not confliction wi
th the land use at the site. The OC-33 site is 
zoned as General Agriculture. Per Section 7-9-55.4 
of the County Zoning Code, public/private utility 
buildings and structures are permitted in a General 
Agriculture zone subject to a use permit. Water 
transmission facilities are not subject to city zoni
ng ordinances, per Government Code 53091, and therefore a use permit would not be required. Impacts would be less than significant. 
The proposed facilities would not conflict with a
ny land use plan, policy, or regulation. Impacts 
would be less than significant.

Recreational Facilities Impact 3.9-2: Construction of the proposed 
project could affect recreational facilities and have a significant effect on the environment. (Less than Significant with Mitigation) 
The proposed sewer pipeline would be constructe
d within an existing 15-foot utility easement 
along a segment of Serrano Creek Trail. Construction of the pipeline would take approximately 
six months, during which time portions of the tr
ail may be closed to the public as pipeline 
installation progresses. On average, 50 to 100 feet 
of pipeline may be installed per day. During 
construction, trail detours would 
be established to enable continued use of the trail by the public 
to the extent feasible. Implementation of 
Mitigation Measure LU-1
 would ensure that IRWD 
maintain access to recreational trails to the extent
 feasible. Once the pipeline is installed, the trail 
would be restored to pre-construction conditions as required by 
Mitigation Measure AES-2. (See Section 3.1 Aesthetics for Mitigation Measure A
ES-2). There would be no long-term permanent 
impact to recreational facilities. Impacts would be less than significant with mitigation. 
The proposed Raw Water Pump Station would be 
located within Peters Canyon Regional Park, 
on land designated as Open Space Park. Howeve
r, the proposed pump station would be 
constructed onsite and replace the existing Intertie facility. The proposed pump station would not 
affect the surrounding recreational facility and as 
a result would not have an adverse physical 
effect on the environment. There would be no impact.  
The proposed OC-33 Meter Exchange would be 
located within Irvine Regional Park, on land 
designated as Open Space. However, the proposed meter and pipeline exchange would be 
constructed onsite and replace existing facilities. The OC-33 site is access via an unimproved 
road within the park; however, access is restrict
ed by a locked gate. The OC-33 Meter Exchange would not affect the surrounding recreational facility or its use by the public and as a result would 
not have an adverse physical effect on the environment. There would be no impact. 
Mitigation Measures 
LU-1: For installation of the sewer pipeline,
 IRWD shall require the construction contractor to prepare and implement a Trail De
tour Plan prior to construction. The plan 
shall:  Identify hours of construction.  
 Include a work area delineation requiring trail detours. 
 Identify and establish detours around constr
uction where room is available without 
affecting vegetation. Install detour signs as appropriate. 
 If detours are not possible identify signage requirements noting temporary trail closure. 
 Post notices regarding upcoming trail detours and closures at trail heads and entry 
points at least 10 days in advance.

result from implementation of the proposed proj
ect, and mitigation measures where appropriate.  
Noise Principles 
and Descriptors 
Noise is defined as unwanted sound. Sound, traveli
ng in the form of waves from a source, exerts 
a sound pressure level (referred to as sound level) wh
ich is measured in decibels (dB), with zero 
dB corresponding roughly to the threshold of human hearing, and 120 to 140 dB corresponding to 

the threshold of pain. Pressure waves traveling th
rough air exert a force registered by the human 
ear as sound. 
Sound pressure fluctuations can be measured in
 units of hertz (Hz), which correspond to the 
frequency of a particular sound. Typically, soun
d does not consist of a single frequency, but 
rather a broad band of frequencies varying in le
vels of magnitude (sound power). When all the 
audible frequencies of a sound are measured, a sound
 spectrum is plotted consisting of a range of 
frequency spanning 20 to 20,000 Hz. The sound pressu
re level, therefore, constitutes the additive force exerted by a sound corresponding to the 
sound frequency/sound power level spectrum. 
The typical human ear is not equally sensitive to
 all frequencies of the audible sound spectrum. As a consequence, when assessing potential noise im
pacts, sound is measured using an electronic 
filter that de-emphasizes the frequencies belo
w 1,000 Hz and above 5,000 Hz in a manner corresponding to the human ears decreased sens
itivity to low and extremely high frequencies 
instead of the frequency mid-range. This met
hod of frequency weighting is referred to as 
A-weighting and is expressed in units of A-wei
ghted decibels (dBA). Frequency A-weighting follows an international standard methodology of 
frequency de-emphasis and is typically applied 
to community noise measurements. Some repr
esentative noise sources and the corresponding A-weighted noise levels are shown in Figure 3.10-1
.  Noise Exposure and Community Noise 
An individual™s noise exposure is a measure of noi
se over a period of time. A noise level is a 
measure of noise at a given instant in time. Th
e noise levels presented in Figure 3.10-1 are 
representative of measured noise at a given instant in
 time; however, they rarely persist consistently 
over a long period of time. Rather, community noise
 varies continuously over a period of time with 
respect to the contributing sound sources of the co
mmunity noise environment. Community noise is 
primarily the product of many distant noise sour
ces, which constitute a re
latively stable background 
noise exposure, with the indivi
dual contributors unidentifiable. 
The background noise level changes 
throughout a typical day, but does so gradually, co
rresponding with the addition and subtraction of 
distant noise sources such as tr
affic and atmospheric conditions.

What makes community noise constantly variable
 throughout a day, besides the slowly changing 
background noise, is the addition of short dura
tion single event noise sources (e.g., aircraft 
flyovers, motor vehicles, sirens), which are readily identifiable to the individual. 
These successive additions of sound to the co
mmunity noise environment varies the community 
noise level from instant to instant requiring the 
measurement of noise exposure over a period of 
time to legitimately characterize a community 
noise environment and evaluate cumulative noise 
impacts. This time-varying characteristic of e
nvironmental noise is described using statistical noise descriptors. The most frequently used
 noise descriptors are summarized below: 
Leq: The equivalent sound level is used to
 describe noise over a specified period of time, 
typically one hour, in terms of a single numeri
cal value. The Leq is the constant sound 
level which would contain the same acoustic
 energy as the varying sound level, during 
the same time period (i.e., the average noi
se exposure level for the given time period). 
Lmax: The instantaneous maximum noise le
vel for a specified period of time. 
L50: The noise level that is equaled or exceed
ed 50 percent of the specified time period.  
The L50 represents the median sound level. 
L90: The noise level that is equaled or exceed
ed 90 percent of the specified time period.  
The L90 is sometimes used to re
present the background sound level. DNL: Also termed Ldn, the DNL is the 24-hour da
y and night A-weighted noise exposure level, 
which accounts for the greater sensitivity of most people to nighttime noise by weighting 
noise levels at night (ﬁpena
lizingﬂ nighttime noises). Noi
se between 10:00 p.m. and 
7:00 a.m. is weighted (penalized) by adding 10 dBA to take into account the greater 
annoyance of nighttime noises. 
CNEL: Similar to the DNL the Community Noi
se Equivalent Level (CNEL) adds a 5-dBA 
ﬁpenaltyﬂ for the evening hours between 7:
00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., in addition to a 
10-dBA penalty between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
As a general rule, in areas where the noise envir
onment is dominated by traffic, the Leq during 
the peak-hour is generally equivalent to the DNL at that location (Caltrans, 1998). 
Effects of Noise on People 
The effects of noise on people can be placed into three categories: 
 Subjective effects of annoyance, nuisance, dissatisfaction; 
 Interference with activities such 
as speech, sleep, learning; and 
 Physiological effects such as hearing loss or sudden startling. 
Environmental noise typically produces effects in the first two categories. Workers in industrial 
plants can experience noise in the last category.
 There is no completely satisfactory way to

April 2011 
measure the subjective effects of noise, or the corresponding reactions of annoyance and 
dissatisfaction. A wide variation in individual 
thresholds of annoyance exists, and different 
tolerances to noise tend to develop based on an
 individual™s past experiences with noise. 
Thus, an important way of predicting a human r
eaction to a new noise environment is the way it 
compares to the existing environment to which one has adapted: the so called ﬁambient noiseﬂ 

level. In general, the more a new noise exceeds 
the previously existing ambient noise level, the 
less acceptable the new noise will be judged by tho
se hearing it. With regard to increases in  
A-weighted noise level, the following relationships occur: 
 Except in carefully controlled laboratory e
xperiments, a change of 1 dBA cannot be 
perceived;  Outside of the laboratory, a 3-dBA change is
 considered a just-perceivable difference;  
 A change in level of at least 5 dBA is re
quired before any noticeable change in human 
response would be expected; and  A 10-dBA change is subjectively heard as a
pproximately a doubling 
in loudness, and can cause adverse response. 
These relationships occur in part because of the 
logarithmic nature of sound and the decibel 
system. The human ear perceives sound in a non-
linear fashion; hence the decibel scale was 
developed. Because the decibel scale is based on 
logarithms, two noise sources do not combine in 
a simple additive fashion, rather logarithmically. For example, if two identical noise sources 

produce noise levels of 50 dBA the combined sound level would be 53 dBA, not 100 dBA. 
Noise Attenuation 
Stationary point sources of noise, including stationary mobile sources such as idling vehicles, 
attenuate (lessen) at a rate between 6 dBA for ha
rd surfaced sites and 7.5 dBA for soft surfaced 
sites for each doubling of distance from the referenc
e measurement. Hard surfaced sites are those with a reflective surface between the source and 
the receiver such as parking lots or smooth 
bodies of water. No excess ground attenuation is assumed for hard sites and the changes in noise levels with distance (the drop-off rate) is simp
ly the geometric spreadi
ng of the noise from the 
source. Soft surfaced sites have an absorptive gr
ound surface such as soft dirt, grass or scattered 
bushes and trees. In addition to geometric spr
eading, an excess ground attenuation value of 1.5 
dBA (per doubling distance) is normally assumed for soft sites. Line sources (such as traffic noise 

from vehicles) attenuate at a rate of between 3 dB
A for hard sites and 4.5 dBA for soft sites for 
each doubling of distance from the refe
rence measurement (Caltrans, 1998). 
Fundamentals of Vibration As described in the Federal Transit Administration™s (FTA) 
Transit Noise and Vibration Impact 
Assessment
 (FTA, 2006), ground-borne vibration can be 
a serious concern for nearby neighbors 
of a transit system route or maintenance facility
, causing buildings to shake and rumbling sounds 
to be heard. In contrast to airborne noise, gr
ound-borne vibration is not a common environmental 
problem. It is unusual for vibration from sources su
ch as buses and trucks to be perceptible, even

April 2011 
in locations close to major roads. Some common sources of ground-borne vibration are trains, 
buses on rough roads, and construction activities 
such as blasting, pile-driving and operating heavy earth-moving equipment.  
There are several different methods that are used to quantify vibration. The peak particle velocity 
(PPV) is defined as the maximum instantaneous p
eak of the vibration signal. The PPV is most 
frequently used to describe vibration impacts 
to buildings. The root mean square (RMS) 
amplitude is most frequently used to describe 
the affect of vibration on the human body. The 
RMS amplitude is defined as the average of the s
quared amplitude of the signal. Decibel notation 
(Vdb) is commonly used to measure RMS. The 
decibel notation acts to compress the range of 
numbers required to describe vibration. Typi
cally, ground-borne vibration generated by man-
made activities attenuates rapidly with distan
ce from the source of the vibration. Sensitive 
receptors for vibration include structures (especially older masonry structures), people (especially 
residents, the elderly and sick), and vibration sensitive equipment. 
The effects of ground-borne vibration include 
movement of the building floors, rattling of 
windows, shaking of items on shelves or hangi
ng on walls, and rumbling sounds. In extreme 
cases, the vibration can cause damage to buildings. Building damage is not a factor for most 

projects, with the occasional exception of blasting and pile-driving during construction. Annoyance from vibration often occurs when the 
vibration exceeds the threshold of perception by 
only a small margin. A vibration level that cau
ses annoyance will be well below the damage 
threshold for normal buildings. The FTA measure of
 the threshold of architectural damage for 
conventional sensitive structures is 0.2 in/sec PPV 
and the FTA threshold of human annoyance to 
ground-borne vibration is 80 RMS (FTA, 2006).  
Project Area Noise Environment and Sensitive Receptors 
The noise environment surrounding the proposed project 
site is influenced primarily by traffic on 
local roadways. Some land uses ar
e considered more sensitive to ambient noise levels than others 
because of the amount of noise exposure (in term
s of both exposure duration and insulation from 
noise) and the types of activities typically involved. Residences, hotels, schools, rest homes, and 
hospitals are generally more sensitive to noise 
than commercial and industrial land uses. The 
proposed Baker WTP, treated water pipeline altern
atives, and sewer pipeline are located in an 
area consisting primarily of residential land u
ses. The nearby residences, which qualify as noise 
sensitive land uses, would potentially be exposed 
to noise generated from project activities. The 
distance from the pipeline construction activities to
 the closest residences is approximately 30 
feet. Construction activities at the Baker site would get as close as 100 feet from residences 

located on Wisteria. The proposed Raw Water Pump Station would be located near Peters 
Canyon Reservoir, approximately 
1,190 feet south of the nearest sensitive receptor. The pipeline 
replacement associated with the OC-33 Meter Exch
ange is would be approximately 500 feet from 
the nearest sensitive receptor within Irvine Regional Park to the west.

Federal 
Federal regulations establish noise limits for medium
 and heavy trucks (more than 4.5 tons, gross 
vehicle weight rating) under 40 Code of Federa
l Regulations (CFR), Part 205, Subpart B. The 
federal truck pass-by noise standard is 80 dBA 
at 15 meters from the vehicle pathway centerline. 
These controls are implemented through re
gulatory controls on 
truck manufacturers. 
State The State of California establishes noise limits for vehicles licensed to operate on public roads. For 
heavy trucks, the state pass-by standard is consistent with the federal limit of 80 dB. The state pass-by 

standard for light trucks and passenge
r cars (less than 4.5 tons, gross ve
hicle rating) is also 80 dBA at 
15 meters from the centerline. These standard
s are implemented through controls on vehicle 
manufacturers and by legal sanction of vehicle operat
ors by state and local law enforcement officials. 
The state has also established noise insulation st
andards for new multi-family residential units, 
hotels, and motels that would be subject to rela
tively high levels of tran
sportation-related noise. These requirements are collectively known as th
e California Noise Insulation Standards  
(Title 24, California Code of Regulations). The 
noise insulation standards set forth an interior standard of DNL 45 dBA in any habitable r
oom. They require an acoustical analysis 
demonstrating how dwelling units ha
ve been designed to meet this 
interior standard where such 
units are proposed in areas subject to noise leve
ls greater than DNL 60 dBA. Title 24 standards 
are typically enforced by local jurisdictions
 through the building permit application process. 
Local 
City of Lake Forest Municipal Code 
Chapter 11.16,040 Exterior Noise Standards, states that the following exterior noise standards 
apply to all residential property: 
 55 dBA between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 
 50 dBA between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
Section 11.16.060 Exemptions states that construction noise is exempt from the exterior noise 
standards when it occurs between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., excluding Sundays or

the County of Orange (Section 3-15-5 Exemptions). 
Methodology 
Noise impacts are assessed
 based on a comparative analysis of
 the noise levels resulting from the 
proposed project and the noise levels under 
existing conditions. Analysis of temporary 
construction noise effects is based on typical c
onstruction phases and equipment noise levels and 
attenuation of those noise levels due to distances, and any barriers between the construction 
activity and the sensitive receptors near the sources of construction noise. 
Significance Criteria 
Based on the CEQA Guidelines
, a project may be deemed to have a significant effect on the 
environment with respect to noise and/or gr
ound-borne vibration if it would result in: 
 Exposure of persons to, or generation of, noise 
levels in excess of standards established in the local general plan or noise ordinance, 
or applicable standards of other agencies;  A substantial permanent increase in ambient 
noise levels in the project vicinity above 
levels existing without the project;  
 A substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels in the project 
vicinity above levels existing without the project; 
 Exposure of people residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels  
(for a project located within an airport land u
se plan or, where such 
a plan has not been adopted, within two miles of a public airport or public use airport);  
 Exposure of people residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels  
(for a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip); or

 Exposure of persons to, or generation of
, excessive ground-borne vibration or ground-
borne noise levels.  
Impacts Discussion 
The following is a discussion of the potential effect
s of the proposed project to noise according to 
the key issue areas identified in Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines
.  Public Airports or Private Airstrip 
The closest airport to the proposed project is 
the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) El Toro, located approximately two miles northeast of the proposed Baker site. The air station was 

decommissioned in 1999. Thus, the proposed pr
oject would not expose people to excessive noise levels associated with airport uses. There would be no impact. 
Noise Standards 
Impact 3.10-1: Project construction and operation could expose persons to or generate noise 
levels in excess of the City of Orange and/or 
City of Lake Forest noise standards. (Less than 
Significant with Mitigation) 
Construction 
Construction activity noise levels at and near 
the construction areas would fluctuate depending on 
the particular type, number, a
nd duration of uses of various pi
eces of construction equipment. 
Construction-related material ha
ul trips would raise ambient noise levels along haul routes, 
depending on the number of haul trips made and ty
pes of vehicles used. In addition, certain types of construction equipment gene
rate impulsive noises (such as pile driving), which can be 
particularly bothersome. Pile driving howeve
r is not anticipated as a construction method 
required for the proposed project. Noise from constr
uction activities generally attenuates at a rate 
of 6.0 to 7.5 dBA per doubling distance. Based on 
the proposed project site layout and terrain, an 
attenuation of 6.0 dBA is assumed.  
Pipelines The nearest sensitive receptor to pipeline construc
tion activities would be approximately 30 feet 
from the sewer pipeline alignment. 
Table 3.10-1 shows that the greatest noise levels are 
associated with excavation and finishing and 
would be 89 dBA at a distance of 50 feet. 
Accordingly, attenuated at 30 feet, these reside
nces would experience noise levels of up to 93 
dBA Leq during finishing and excavation, the loudest of construction activities that would occur. 

However, an average of 50 to 100 feet of pipeline may be installed per day; therefore sensitive 
receptors would be exposed to pipeline constr
uction noise for very short periods of time. 
Baker WTP 
The nearest sensitive receptors to construction activ
ities at the Baker site would be residences on 
Wisteria approximately 100 feet from the Baker 
site property boundary. Table 3.10-1 shows that 
the greatest noise levels are associated with excav
ation and finishing and would be 89 dBA at a  3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

levels of up to 83 dBA Leq during finishing and ex
cavation, the loudest of construction activities 
that would occur. 

 Raw Water Pump Station 
The nearest sensitive receptor to construction activ
ities at the Raw Water Pump Station would be 
residences approximately 1,190 feet south
north. Table 3.10-1 shows that the greatest noise levels 
are associated with excavation and finishing 
and would be 89 dBA at a distance of 50 feet. 
Accordingly, attenuated at 1,190 feet, these resi
dences would experience noise levels of up to 61 
dBA Leq during finishing and excavation, the loudest of construction activities that would occur.  
OC-33 Meter Exchange 
The pipeline replacement associated with the OC
-33 Meter Exchange is 
would be approximately 
500 feet from the nearest sensitive receptor within 
Irvine Regional Park to the west. Table 3.10-1 
shows that the greatest noise levels are associated
 with excavation and finishing and would be 89 
dBA at a distance of 50 feet. Accordingly, attenuated at 30 feet, these residences would 
experience noise levels of up to 69 dBA Leq during finishing and excavation, the loudest of 

construction activities that would occur. 
As a result, the construction of the proposed proj
ect would have the potential to have a temporary 
noise impacts to sensitive receptors.  However, 
with the implementation of Mitigation Measure 
NOISE-1, which includes but is not limited to co
mplying with the exempt construction hours in 
accordance with the City of Lake Forest Munici
pal Code, City of Orange Municipal Code, and County of Orange Municipal Code, would redu
ce construction noise impacts to less than 
significant levels. For the proposed project, a few pipeline tie-ins, such as the sewer and AMP pipeline connections, 
would have to occur at night during periods of low flow in the pipeline system. These activities

would be of a short duration (
one night) and would require IRWD to secure a variance from the 
City of Lake Forest™s exterior noise standards 
if such tie-in activities generate noise in excess of 
the exterior noise standards. Implementation of
 Mitigation Measure NOISE-2 would ensure that 
IRWD secures noise variances from the relevant 
jurisdiction prior to nighttime construction 
activities that would generate noise in excess of
 noise standards. Mitigation Measure NOISE-1 
would also require IRWD provide advanced 
notice of nighttime construction activities to 
neighboring properties. Impacts would be consid
ered less than significant with mitigation. 
Operation 
The proposed project would construct the Baker WT
P at the existing Baker site. Noise generating equipment such as pumps, blowers, and strainers that
 would be used in operation of the proposed 
Baker WTP would be housed inside buildings 
to the extent possible. The buildings and 
mechanical equipment would be designed for noi
se attenuation such that the sound levels would 
be in compliance with the City of Lake For
est Noise Ordinance (11.16.040 Exterior Noise 
Standards) at the Baker WTP property line. At th
e boundary with adjacent residential properties, 
noise levels would not exceed 55 dBA between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. or 50 dBA 
between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. Therefore, operation of the WTP would not 

generate noise levels in excess of standards a
nd would be considered less than significant. Implementation of Mitigation Measure NOISE-3 w
ould ensure that project operation does not exceed noise standards by requiring post-construc
tion noise monitoring to confirm compliance 
with standards at the property boundary.  
The Raw Water Pump Station is being constructed 
at the existing Intertie facility. The pumps at 
the proposed facility would be enclosed, and woul
d be inaudible to the nearest sensitive receptor 
located approximately 1,190 feet to the south
north
. Nonetheless, the proposed pump station 
would be designed for noise attenuation such that
 the sound levels would be in compliance with 
the City of Orange Noise Ordinance (8.24.050 Ex
terior Noise Standards) at the property line. 
Implementation of Mitigation Measure NOISE-3 w
ould ensure that project operation does not exceed noise standards by requiring post-construc
tion noise monitoring to confirm compliance 
with standards at the property boundary.
 Impacts would be considered less than significant. 
Mitigation Measures 
NOISE-1: 
To reduce daytime noise impacts due to construction activities, in addition to 
complying with the construction hours for standard construction activities, the project 

applicant shall require construction contr
actors to implement the following measures
:  Construction shall be restricted to th
e hours between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., 
excluding Sundays or federal holidays, except as otherwise permitted by the City of 

Lake Forest or the City of Orange. 
 Equipment and trucks used for project construction shall use noise control techniques 
(e.g., mufflers, use of intake silencers, 
ducts, engine enclosures, and acoustically-attenuating shields or shrouds).  Adjacent land uses within 500 feet of the c
onstruction site shall be notified about the 
estimated duration and hours of construction 
activity at least 30 days before the start 
of construction.

3.10 Noise and Vibration 
IRWD Baker Regional Water Treatment Plant
 3.10-11 ESA / D208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
 A noise disturbance coordinator shall be established. The noise disturbance coordinator shall be responsible for r
esponding to any local complaints about 
construction noise. The noise disturbance 
coordinator would determine the cause of 
the noise complaint (e.g., starting too early, bad mufflers, etc.) and would be required 
to resolve the noise complaints. All notices 
sent to adjacent land uses within 500 feet of the construction site and all signs poste
d at the construction site shall list the telephone number and e-mail address for 
the noise disturbance coordinator. 
NOISE-2: 
IRWD shall secure a noise variance from the relevant jurisdiction prior to 
nighttime construction activities that would ge
nerate noise in excess of noise standards. NOISE-3: 
IRWD shall conduct a post-construction noi
se survey to ensure that operation of 
new equipment at the Baker WTP and Raw Water Pump Station
 is in compliance with the 
City of Lake Forest Noise Ordinance (11.16.040 Exterior Noise Standards) and City of 
Orange Noise Ordinance (8.24.050 Exterior Noise Standards)
 at the property boundary.  
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.   Vibration Impact 3.10-2: Project construction would generate groundborne vibration and noise. (Less 
than Significant) 
Vibration and groundborne noise impacts tend to occur when physically forceful or ground-
penetrating equipment is utilized, such as pile
 drivers or where blasting is necessary. The 
proposed construction activities include excavation and large earth-moving vehicles, but no pile 
driving or percussive impact construction methods
 will be needed. The nearest sensitive receptors 
to the Baker WTP site are located approximately
 100 feet from proposed construction activities. 
At this distance, groundborne vibration from
 the proposed construction activities would not damage neighboring structures. 
The nearest sensitive receptors to the sewer
 pipeline construction activities would be 
approximately 30 feet. Pipeline construction woul
d require the use of a backhoe, a front end 
loader, and a haul truck. Open-trench construc
tion methods in this area would not generate 
substantial vibration. Furthermore, an average of
 50 to 100 feet of pipeline may be installed per 
day; therefore local receptors would be exposed 
to pipeline construction noise and vibration for 
short periods of time. As a result, the proposed project would not generate significant 

groundborne vibration or groundborne noise impact
s that could result in damaged properties. 
Impacts would be considered less than significant. 
Mitigation Measures 
None required.

Ambient Noise Levels 
Impact 3.10-3: Activities associated with operati
ons of the project could increase noise levels 
at nearby land uses. (Less than Significant)  
The proposed project would construct the Baker WT
P at the existing Baker site. Noise generating equipment such as pumps, blowers, and strainers that
 would be used in operation of the proposed 
Baker WTP could elevate ambient noise levels at
 nearby land uses, where nearby residences are 
as close as approximately 100 feet from the Bake
r site property boundary. The proposed facilities 
would be housed inside buildings to the extent 
possible. The buildings and mechanical equipment 
would be designed for noise attenuation such that
 the sound levels would be in compliance with 
the City of Lake Forest Noise Ordinance (11.16.0
40 Exterior Noise Standards) at the Baker WTP property line. At the boundary with adjacent resi
dential properties, noise levels would not exceed 55 dBA between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. or 50 dBA between the hours of 10:00 

p.m. and 7:00 p.m. The maintenance of ambient 
noise levels at or below those required by the 
noise ordinance would be sufficient for impact
s to be considered less than significant. Implementation of Mitigation Measure NOISE-3 w
ould ensure that operational noise levels do not exceed those permitted under the noise ordinance. 
The Raw Water Pump Station is being constructed 
at the existing Intertie facility. The pumps at 
the proposed facility would be enclosed and woul
d be inaudible to the nearest sensitive receptor 
located approximately 1,190 feet to the south.
 Therefore, would be no increase in ambient noise 
levels as detected by neighboring sensitive land 
uses; impacts would be less than significant.  
Mitigation Measures

3.11 Public Services and Utilities 
This section discusses existing public services, utiliti
es and energy systems in the vicinity of the 
proposed project. This section presents the associ
ated regulatory framework and provides an 
analysis of potential impacts to public services, 
utilities, and energy systems that would result 
from the proposed project. Public services include: fire protection, police protection, schools, and 

hospitals. Public utilities in the project area include
: water, wastewater, storm water, solid waste, 
electricity, and natural gas conveyance facilities. 
The following discussion describes existing pub
lic services, utilities and energy systems. 
Public Services Fire Protection Fire protection and paramedic services are provided in the vicinity of the Baker site by the 
Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA). The Lake Fo
rest Fire Station is located at 23022 El Toro 
Road, approximately two miles from the Baker site (OCFA, 2010).  
Fire protection and paramedic services are provided in the vicinity of the Raw Water Pump 
Station by the City of Orange Fire Department. Th
e nearest City of Orange fire station is located 
at 7401 E. Fort Road, approximately one mile fro
m the proposed Pump Station (City of Orange, 
2009a). 
Fire protection and paramedic services are provided in the vicinity of OC-33 by the OCFA. The 
Orange Fire Station #7 is located at 8501 E. 
Fort Road, approximately one mile from OC-33 
(OCFA, 2010). 
Police Protection 
Police services may be required at the construction 
site in the event of an emergency. The Orange 
County Sheriff™s Department provides law en
forcement services to the Baker site and surrounding area and to the OC-33 site. The Lake 
Forest Community Police Center, located at 
25550 Commercentre Drive in Lake Forest, is a
pproximately three miles from the Baker site 
(City of Lake Forest, 2006). The Orange Police 
Department provides law enforcement services in 
the vicinity of the proposed Raw Water Pump St
ation area. The nearest City of Orange police 
station is located at 8554 E. Fort Road, approximately one mile from the proposed Raw Water 

Pump Station (City of Orange, 2009a).

is located one mile away from the Baker site 
and proposed pipelines at 21801 Pittsford Drive. 
La Madera Elementary is located two miles 
away at 25350 Serrano Road, and El Toro High 
School is located two miles away at 25255 Toledo Way.  
Orange Unified School District provides public sch
ool services within the City of Orange. Within 
the vicinity of the Raw Water Pump Station, Chap
man Hills Elementary is located one mile away 
at 170 Aspen Street. Santiago Canyon College 
is a two-year community college located 
approximately 1.5 miles from the proposed Raw 
Water Pump Station at 8045 E. Chapman Ave 
(City of Orange, 2009a).  
Hospitals 
Saddleback Memorial Medical Center is located 
at 24451 Health Center Drive in Laguna Hills 
and is five miles away from the Baker site and 
proposed pipelines. Chapman Medical Center is 
located at 2601 East Chapman Ave. and is approximately five miles from the proposed Raw 

Water Pump Station and OC-33.  
Public Utilities  Water Facilities 
The City of Lake Forest is served by the IRWD
, El Toro Water District, and the Trabuco Canyon 
Water District. The proposed Baker WTP woul
d be within IRWD™s service area and would 
provide water to customers of IRWD and the pa
rtner water agencies. Thirty-five percent of 
IRWD™s drinking water supply is imported from 
MWD, which as a water wholesaler gets its supplies from the Colorado River and the State Water Project. IRWD obtains 65 percent of its 
drinking water supplies from the local groundwater
 basin, which is managed by Orange County 
Water District (OCWD). IRWD™s portion of th
e water produced at the proposed Baker WTP would be delivered to IRWD customers in th
e Serrano Highlands neighborhood adjacent to the 
Baker site and customers in other IRWD service areas.   
The City of Orange obtains 55 percent of its pot
able water from local groundwater resources that 
are managed by OCWD and supplied by City-own
ed wells. The City also purchases 40 percent of 
its potable water from imported water sources as a member agency of the Municipal Water 

District of Orange County (MWDOC), which is a wholesale water district that receives imported 

water from MWD. Further, the City receives 3 to
 5 percent of its potable water supply from the 
Serrano Water District, and small areas in southeastern Orange receive water from both IRWD 

and East Orange County Water Dist
rict (City of Orange, 2009b).  
Wastewater  
Wastewater generated in the vicinity of the Baker 
site in the City of Lake Forest is conveyed to 
and treated at the Los Alisos Water Recycling 
Plant (LAWRP). LAWRP currently has a nominal 
dry weather treatment capacity of 7.5 mgd for r
eclaimed water production. Effluent that is not 
reclaimed to meet landscape and agricultural i
rrigation demands is sent to the South Orange

County Water Agency (SOCWA) outfall for secondary treatment and ocean disposal (City of 
Lake Forest, 2006).  
The proposed project would not affect wastewater systems in the City of Orange or the County. 
Operation of the proposed Raw Water Pump Sta
tion and OC-33 would not generate wastewater.  
Storm Water 
The Orange County Flood Control District provi
des for the planning, development, operation, 
and maintenance of the flood control facilities on a Countywide basis. The proposed project 

components are located within both the San Diego Creek and Lower Santa Ana River 

Watersheds. The storm drain conveyance system at the project sites connect to local creeks, 

including Serrano Creek adjacent to the Baker s
ite and proposed sewer pipeline and Santiago 
Creek near OC-33 and the proposed Raw Water Pump
 Station. Santiago Creek eventually drains 
to the Lower Santa Ana River and Serrano Creek ev
entually drains into Upper Newport Bay and 
the Pacific Ocean (City of Orange, 2009a; EDAW, 2010).  
Solid Waste Management  
The Orange County Integrated Waste Management
 Department (IWMD) owns and operates three 
public landfills in Orange County, California 
that accept municipal solid waste. These include 
Frank R. Bowerman Landfill in Irvine, which accep
ts commercial waste only; the Olinda Alpha 
Landfill in Brea, which accepts both public a
nd commercial waste; and the Prima Deshecha 
Landfill in San Juan Capistrano, which also accepts
 both public and commercial waste. All three 
landfills are Class III (only accept non-hazardous municipal waste). Both Orange and Lake Forest 

are primarily served by the Prima Deschec
ha Landfill (Orange County, 2009).   
Electricity and Natural Gas 
Both the Baker site, Raw Water Pump Station site, and OC-33 are within the service area of the 
Southern California Edison Company (SCE), an 
electricity provider. SCE owns and operates the 
electric power delivery network and substations 
in its service area. A subsidiary of Edison 
International, SCE has 5,000 megawatts of 
generating capacity from interests in nuclear, 
hydroelectric, and fossil-fueled power plants
. Individual businesses and communities within the 
service areas are able to have contracts with i
ndependent power generators, as allowed by the 
deregulation of the electric power i
ndustry (City of Lake Forest, 2006). 
All project components are within the service boundary of the Southern California Gas Company, 
the largest natural gas utility in the Country. A s
ubsidiary of Sempra Energy, the utility annually 
delivers approximately one trillion cubic feet of gas. Similar to electricity, gas customers in the 

project area have the option of purchasing their 
natural gas from a private gas supplier (City of 
Lake Forest, 2006).

State Protection of Underground Infrastructure The California Government Code Section 
4216-4216.9 ﬁProtection of Underground 
Infrastructureﬂ requires an excavator to contact
 a regional notification center (e.g., Underground 
Services Alert or Dig Alert) at least two days pr
ior to excavation of any subsurface installations. 
Any utility provider seeking to begi
n a project that could damage underground infrastructure can 
call Underground Service Alert, the regional no
tification center for southern California. 
Underground Service Alert will notify the utilities that
 may have buried lines within 1,000 feet of 
the project. Representatives of the utilities are then notified and are required to mark the specific location of their facilities within the work area prio
r to the start of project activities in the area. 
2005 California Energy Action Plan II 
The California Energy Action Plan II is the state™s principal energy planning and policy document 
(California Energy Commission, 2005, 2008). Th
e plan identifies state-wide energy goals, 
describes a coordinated implementation plan for 
state energy policies, and identifies specific 
action areas to ensure that California™s energy is
 adequate, affordable, technologically advanced, 
and environmentally sound. In accordance with this
 plan, the first priority actions to address 
California™s increasing energy demands are energy efficiency and demand response 

(i.e., reduction of customer energy usage durin
g peak periods in order to address system 
reliability and support the best use of energy infr
astructure). Additional priorities include the use 
of renewable sources of power and distributed ge
neration (i.e., the use of relatively small power 
plants near or at centers of high demand). To the 
extent that these actions are unable to satisfy the 
increasing energy and capacity needs, clean and 
efficient fossil-fired generation is supported. 
In 2002, California established its Renewable Portfolio Standard program,
1 with the goal of increasing the percentage of renewable energy in 
the state™s electricity mix to 20 percent by 2017. 
The California Energy Commission subsequently 
accelerated that goal to 2010, and further 
recommended increasing the target to 33 percent 
by 2020. Because much of electricity demand 
growth is expected to be met by increases in 
natural-gas-fired generati
on, reducing consumption 
of electricity and diversifying electricity genera
tion resources are significant elements of plans to 
reduce natural gas demand. 
California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 
The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (PRC, Division 30), enacted through 

AB 939 and modified by subsequent legislation,
 required all California cities and counties to 
                                                     
 1  The Renewable Portfolio Standard is a flexible, market-drive
n policy to ensure that the public benefits of wind, solar, 
biomass, and geothermal energy continue to be realized 
as electricity markets become
 more competitive. The policy 
ensures that a minimum amount of renewable energy is include
d in the portfolio of electricity resources serving a state 
or country. By increasing the required minimum amount
 over time, the Renewable Portfolio Standard puts the 
electricity industry on a path toward increasing sustainability.

implement programs to reduce, recycle, and compost at least 50 percent of wastes by the year 
2000 (PRC Section 41780). The state determines co
mpliance with this mandate to ﬁdivertﬂ 50 percent of generated waste (which includes 
both disposed and diverted waste) through a 
complex formula. This formula requires citi
es and counties to conduct empirical studies to 
establish a ﬁbase yearﬂ waste generation rate ag
ainst which future diversion is measured. 
Significance Criteria 
The criteria used to determine the significance of
 impacts related to aesthetic resources are based 
on Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines. The proposed project would result in a significant 
impact if it would: 
 Result in substantial adverse physical impacts 
associated with the provision of new or 
physically altered governmental facilities, need
 for new or physically altered governmental 
facilities, the construction of which could cause 
significant environmental impacts, in order 
to maintain acceptable service ratios, res
ponse times, or other performance objectives for 
any of the public services: 
Œ Fire protection; Œ Police protection; 
Œ Schools; and 
Œ Other public facilities. 
 Exceed wastewater treatment requirements of
 the applicable Regional Water Quality 
Control Board; 
 Require or result in the construction of new 
water or wastewater treatment facilities or 
expansion of existing facilities, the cons
truction of which could cause significant environmental effects; 
 Require or result in the construction of new st
orm water drainage facilities or expansion of 
existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental effects; 
 Require new or expanded water 
supply resources or entitlements; 
 Result in a determination by the wastewater 
treatment provider which serves or may serve 
the project that it has inadequate capacity to 
serve the projects projected demand in addition 
to the provider™s existing commitments; 
 Be served by a landfill with insufficient pe
rmitted capacity to accommodate the project 
solid waste disposal needs;  Not comply with federal, state, and local stat
utes and regulations related to solid waste; or 
 Effect local and regional energy supplies such 
that additional electrical capacity is required. 
Impacts Discussion  
The following is a discussion of the potential effect
s of the proposed project to public services 
and utilities according to the key issue areas identified in Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines.  3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

IRWD Baker Regional Water Treatment Plant
 3.11-6 ESA / D208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
Public Services The proposed project does not include new government facilities associated with public services and would not result in the need for new public services facilities that could result in 

environmental impacts. The proposed project
 would construct new water treatment and 
distribution facilities that would not result in a 
need for substantial additional police and fire 
service. The proposed Baker WTP would require preparation of a Hazardous Materials Business 

Plan, Risk Management Plan, and Emergency Resp
onse Plan that would be submitted and kept on file with local emergency response providers. (S
ee Section 3.7 Hazards and Hazardous Materials 
for additional information.) Local police and fire
 services may be required to service the proposed 
Baker WTP in the unlikely event of an emergency. However, this would not require the City of 

Lake Forest or Orange County to build new fac
ilities to maintain response ratios, service ratios or 
other measures of performance. The proposed project
 would also not result in substantial adverse physical impacts to any local schools, hospitals
, parks, or other public facilities because the 
project is not a direct population generator, such as a residential housing project that would result 

in impacts to these and other public facilities due 
to increased use. There would be no impact. 
Wastewater Treatment Requirements and Capacity 
The proposed project would not conflict with wastewater treatment requirements of the 
SARWQCB as it does not involve directly wastew
ater treatment faciliti
es. Non-reclaimable wastewater (NRW) from the proposed Baker WTP 
would be conveyed to the IRWD sanitary 
sewer and treated at the LAWRP which has suffici
ent capacity to handle the waste stream. There 
would be no impact.  
Water Supply and Infrastructure 
Implementation of the proposed project woul
d not require new or expanded water supply 
resources or entitlements. The proposed project would increase water supply reliability in 

southern Orange County by cr
eating redundancy of treatment system capacity and operational 
flexibility in the raw water supply system. Water th
at is directed to the Baker WTP would be in 
place of water being directed to the Diemer Filtration Plant. No new entitlements would be 

necessary and there would be no impact. 
The proposed project would result in the constructi
on of new water treatment facilities, the effects 
of which are discussed throughout this EIR. 
Storm Water Facilities Impact 3.11-1: The proposed project could result in the expansion or construction of new 
storm water drainage facilities. (Less than Significant) 
The proposed project would not result in the cons
truction of new storm water drainage facilities 
or require the expansion of existing facilities. 
Although the proposed project could create new 
impervious surfaces at the proposed Baker WTP and proposed Raw Water Pump Station, the 

increase would not be substantially greater than ex
isting conditions at eith
er site and would not

substantially increase the volume of surface wate
r runoff. An expansion of the existing storm 
drain system would not be required. Impacts would be less than significant.  
Mitigation Measures 
None required. 
_________________________ 
Solid Waste: Landfill Capacity  
Impact 3.11-2: The proposed project could be served by a landfill with insufficient 
permitted capacity to accommodate the projec
t™s solid waste disposal needs. (Less than 
Significant) Construction activities including demolition, s
ite preparation, and excavation may require 
disposal of construction waste into local landfills. The cities of Lake Forest and Orange are 
primarily served by the Prima Deshecha Landfill in 
San Juan Capistrano. The landfill is permitted 
to accept up to 4,000 tons of waste per day an
d has approximately 699 acres permitted for refuse 
disposal. The landfill was opened in 1976 and is
 scheduled to close in approximately 2067 
(Orange County, 2009). This landfill would be av
ailable to serve the proposed project during 
construction and operation. Impacts of the proposed 
project to landfill capacity would be less than 
significant.  Mitigation Measures 
None required. 
_________________________ 
Solid Waste: Regulations  Impact 3.11-3: The proposed project would comp
ly with federal, state, and local statutes 
and regulations related to solid waste. (Less than Significant) The California Integrated Waste Management 
Act of 1989 (Public Resources Code [PRC], 
Division 30), enacted through Assembly Bill (AB) 939
 and modified by subsequent legislation, 
requires all California cities and counties to implement programs to reduce, recycle, and compost 

at least 50 percent of wastes by the y
ear 2000 (PRC Section 41780) (CIWMB, 2009). 
Construction of the proposed project would gene
rate solid waste, including excavated soil and demolition debris. The project would be subject 
to the California Waste Management Act. In 
addition, all exported waste materi
al would be properly disposed of in an appropriate landfill. 
Impacts would be less than significant. 
Prior to demolition of existing facilities at the Ba
ker site and proposed Raw Water Pump Station 
site, IRWD would investigate the potential for h
azardous materials (e.g., lead paint and asbestos) 
to have been incorporated into the original c
onstruction. If present, hazardous materials would be

removed by a specialty contractor prior to the general demolition. Hazardous waste materials 
would be handled and disposed in compliance with
 applicable regulations. Impacts would be less 
than significant. Mitigation Measures 
None required. 
_________________________ 
Energy Use 
Impact 3.11-4: The proposed project could a
ffect local and regional energy supplies such that additional electrical capacity is required. (Less than significant) 
The new treatment facilities at the Baker WTP and Raw Water Pump Station would increase 
energy demand by approximately 26,700 mega-watt 
hours per year. Electricity would be provided 
to both sites by Southern California Edison (S
CE). The facility would be connected to the 
existing grid infrastructure connected to both s
ites. No off-site improvements would be necessary 
to provide the energy to operate both facilities at
 full capacity. The project would result in a less 
than significant impact to regional energy capacity
. In addition, the proposed project would treat 
water at the Baker WTP instead of the existing 
Diemer Treatment Plant and would effectively 
redistribute the current energy used to treat the water.  
Mitigation Measures 
None required.

3.12 Transportation and Traffic 
This section addresses potential traffic and circulatio
n impacts on the basis of information supplied 
by the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCT
A), the City of Lake Forest General Plan and EIR, the City of Orange General Plan and EIR, 
the County of Orange General Plan, the City of 
Lake Forest™s Opportunities Study Program EI
R and the Lake Forest Municipal Code.  
Regional Setting The proposed project is located within the cities of Lake Forest and Orange in southern Orange 
County, California. The transportation system within both cities is comprised of an 

interconnected network of roadways, local transit 
systems, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities. 
Interstate 5 (I-5) provides regional connectivit
y throughout Orange County and also provides 
interregional connections to both 
northern and southern Californi
a. Interstate 405 (I-405) merges 
with I-5 just west of the Baker site and also 
provides regional connectivity to northern California. 
State Route 241 (SR 241) parallels I-5 and connects the Eastern Toll Road outside of Irvine with 

Oso Parkway near Mission Viejo. State Route 261 (SR 261) connects I-5 with State Route 241. 

A series of major arterial roads within the commun
ity connect to collector roads that function to 
link neighboring land uses. 
Figure 3.12-1
 shows regional highways and arterial roads in the 
vicinity of the proposed project.  
Interstate 5 (I-5) 
is a 10-lane freeway providing the primary regional access to the project area, 
including the cities of Lake Forest and Orange. In the vicinity of the proposed Baker WTP, I-5 

has southbound and northbound on- and off-ramps at
 Lake Forest Drive and El Toro Road in 
Lake Forest. At Lake Forest, there is both a southbound direct on-ramp and a loop on-ramp. At 

El Toro Road, there are both northbound and southbound direct and loop onramps. I-5 has 

auxiliary lanes on the northbound and southbound directions be
tween Lake Forest Drive and El Toro Road (City of Lake Forest, 2006). 
Interstate 405 (I-405)
 is a major north-south Interstate Highway that provides regional access to 
the project area, running along western Orange County in the vicinity of the proposed Baker 

WTP, I-405 has an on- and off-ramp at Bake Parkway where I-405 merges with I-5.  
State Route 241 (SR-241) 
a four-lane tollway providing the primary regional access to the 
project area on the north end of Lake Forest and 
east end of Orange. SR-241 is a 12-mile tollway 
in Orange County that runs parallel to I-5 and 
connects the Eastern Toll Road outside of Irvine 
with Oso Parkway near Mission Viejo. In the vicinity of the proposed Baker WTP, SR-241 has 

southbound and northbound on- and off-ramps at Alton Parkway and at Portola Parkway; as well 

as a northbound on-ramp and southbound off-ramp at
 Lake Forest Drive. There are auxiliary 
lanes in the northbound and southbound directi
on between Lake Forest city limits and Bake

State Route 261 (SR-261) 
is a north-south toll facility on the eastern edge of the City of Orange. 
This facility provides a connection between I-5
 and SR-241. SR-261 has four toll lanes and 
provides regional access to the Raw Water Pump St
ation through a southbo
und on- and off- ramp 
at East Santiago Canyon Road (City of Lake Forest, 2006).  
Local Roadways
 El Toro Road is a nine-lane north/south commercial street
 from I-5 to Rockfield Boulevard, then 
an eight-lane commercial street to Muirlands, then a six-lane divided major arterial from Trabuco 

north to the city limit. El Toro 
Road provides regional access to the 
project traffic. It serves as a 
major commuter route between I-5 and SR-241 (City of Lake Forest, 2006). 
Bake Parkway is a north/south six-lane divided major arterial from I-405 to Trabuco, then a 
four-lane divided primary arterial from Trabuco 
to Rancho Parkway (City of Lake Forest, 2006). 
Lake Forest Drive 
is a north/south commercial street from I-5 to Muirlands, then a six-lane 
divided major arterial from Muirlands to Trabuco 
Road, then a four-lane divided primary arterial 
from Trabuco Road to Rancho Parkway, then a 
commercial street from Rancho Parkway to 
Portola Parkway (City of Lake Forest, 2006). 
Trabuco Road is an east/west six-lane divided major arteri
al that runs parallel to and between I-5 and SR-241. Trabuco Road intersect
s Bake Parkway, Lake Forest Drive and El Toro Road in the 
vicinity of the Baker site (City of Lake Forest, 2006). 
Muirlands Boulevard is an east/west four-lane divided primar
y arterial that runs parallel to I-5. 
Muirlands Boulevard intersects Bake Parkway, La
ke Forest Drive and El Toro Road in the 
vicinity of the Baker site  (City of Lake Forest, 2006). 
Jamboree Road 
is a northeast/southwest street and is one 
of the major roads in Orange County, 
running from just west of Irvine Lake, all th
e way south to Pacific Coast Highway. The Raw 
Water Pump Station is immediately adjacent to 
Jamboree Road near the intersection of Jamboree 
and Canyon View Avenue. 
Traffic Volumes and Levels of Service 
The City™s of Lake Forest and Orange provide 
information relating to intersection and roadway 
operation as well as Average Daily Traffic (ADT) 
throughout the city. Level of Service (LOS) 
measurements are utilized to describe traffic operations with a scale ranging from LOS A to LOS 
F. LOS A indicates very good, free flow traffic conditions where LOS F indicates very poor,

Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation 
The cities of Lake Forest and Orange contain an extensive trail system that includes pedestrian 
and bike trails within open space corridors a
nd along regional trails. The County maintains a 
coordinated system of trails, including bikeways, 
equestrian trails and hiking trails within the 
cities. Bikeways comprise the most extensive part 
of the cities™ trail network. The biking network 
in Lake Forest and Orange connects with other trails and paths in adjacent communities and 
throughout Orange County. The three categories of bikeways are: 
 Class I: a paved path that is separate from any motor vehicle travel lane; 
 Class II: a restricted lane within the right-of-w
ay of a paved roadway for the exclusive or 
semi-exclusive use of bicycles; and 
 Class III: a bikeway that shares the street w
ith motor vehicles or the sidewalk with 
pedestrians.  The City of Lake Forest contains 12 bike paths. The closest bike paths to the Baker site include three Class II Bikeways located along Bake Parkway, Lake Forest Drive, and Trabuco Drive.

The City of Orange contains 10.6 miles of Class I 
bike paths, 20.8 miles of Class II bike lanes, 
and 3.3 miles of Class III bike routes. In the vicinity of the Raw Water Pump Station and OC-33, 

there is one existing Class II bike path along Jam
boree Road. There are also two proposed bike paths, one Class I bike path along Jamboree Road 
and one Class II bike path along Canyon View 
Road. The development and regulation of the transporta
tion network in the vicinity of the proposed 
project primarily involves state and local jurisdic
tions. All roads within the project area are under 
the jurisdiction of state and local agencies. Appli
cable state and local laws and regulations related 
to traffic and transportation issues are discussed below.  
State  California Department of 
Transportation (Caltrans) 
Caltrans manages interregional transportation, in
cluding management and construction of the 
California highway system. In addition, Caltrans 
is responsible for perm
itting and regulation of 
the use of state roadways. The project area in
cludes four roadways that fall under Caltrans™ 
jurisdiction: I-5, I-405, SR-241, and SR-261. 
Caltrans™ construction practices require temporar
y traffic control planni
ng ﬁduring any time the 
normal function of a roadway is suspendedﬂ (F
HWA, 2003). In addition, Caltrans requires that 
permits be obtained for transporta
tion of oversized loads and transportation of certain materials, 
and for construction-related traffi
c disturbance (Caltrans, 2004). 
Local 
Orange County Congestion Management Plan 
The Congestion Management Plan (CMP) requires that a traffic impact analysis be conducted for 
any project generating 2,400 or more daily trips,
 or 1,600 or more daily trips for projects that 
directly access the CMP Highway System (HS). Per the CMP guidelines, this number is based on 

the desire to analyze any impacts that will be 
3 percent or more of the existing CMP highway 
system facilities™ capacity. The CMPHS includ
es specific roadways, which include State 
Highways and Super Streets, which are now known as Smart Streets, and CMP arterial 

monitoring locations/intersections. Therefore, the CMP traffic impact analysis (TIA) 

requirements relate to the potential impacts onl
y on the specified CMPHS. The CMP highway 
system arterial facilities and CMP arterials in the vicinity of the proposed project include Irvine 

Boulevard/Trabuco Road and El Toro Road. The CMP arterial monitoring locations/intersections 
in the vicinity of the project area include Trabuco Road/El Toro Road, El Toro Road/I-5, and 
within the Extended Study Area, Moulton Parkway/El Toro Road and Irvine Boulevard/SR-133.

Policy 4.1 Create a comprehensive bicycle network that is integrated with other 
transportation systems by establishing complementary on-street and off-street facilities as 

identified in the City of Orange Bikeways Master plan and OCTA Commuter Bikeways 

Strategic Plan, including Santiago Creek, the 
Santa Ana River, and the Tustin Branch Trail. Significance Criteria 
For the purposes of this EIR and consistent with Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, a project that would cause an increase in traffic that is subs
tantial in relation to the existing traffic load and 
capacity of the street system is considered to 
have a significant impact on the environment. The 
project is also considered to have a potentially significant impact if it would: 
 Conflict with an applicable plan, ordi
nance or policy establishing measures of 
effectiveness for the performan
ce of the circulation system, taking into account all modes 
of transportation including mass transit 
and non-motorized travel and relevant 
components of the circulation system, including but not limited to intersections, streets, 

highways and freeways, pedestrian and bicycle paths, and mass transit. 
 Conflict with an applicable congestion mana
gement program, including, but not limited 
to, level of service standards and travel de
mand measures, or other standards established 
by the county congestion management agency for designated roads or highways. 
 Result in a change in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a 
change in location that results in substantial safety risks. 
 Substantially increase hazards due to a desi
gn feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment). 
 Result in inadequate emergency access.

Impacts Discussion 
The following is a discussion of the potential eff
ects of the proposed project to traffic and 
circulation according to the key issue areas identified in Appendix G of the 
CEQA Guidelines.  Public Transportation  
The project area includes public transit systems, su
ch as bus and rail systems, and bike paths. The 
City of Orange and City of Lake Forest Genera
l Plans include alternative transportation-related goals and policies pertaining to long-term land 
use and transportation planning. As project 
construction activities would be temporary, long-t
erm transportation policies and plans would not 
be affected. Construction of Option 1 of the treat
ed water pipeline is the only project component 
that would directly affect roadways. Constr
uction of the pipeline in and around Peachwood, 
Wisteria, and Marin would not affect bus routes 
or bikeways. These roadways currently are not 
designated bikeways and are not segments of a bus route. The only roads in the vicinity of the 

Baker site that contain bus and bike routes in
clude: Trabuco Road, Commercenter Drive, Bake 
Parkway, and Lake Forest Drive. The closest bike
 paths in the vicinity of the Raw Water Pump 
Station and OC-33 include Jamboree Road and Canyon View Avenue. Bus routes in the vicinity 

of the Raw Water Pump Station include Chap
man Avenue, Jamboree Road, E. Santiago Canyon 
Road, and Newport Blvd. Construction and of th
e proposed Raw Water Pump Station and OC-33 
would not directly affect any roadway or cause lane
 closures that would affect bus routes or bike 
paths in the project vicinity. Therefore, no impacts would occur.  
Air Traffic 
The proposed Baker WTP, treated water pipe
line, and sewer pipeline would be located 
approximately two miles southeast of the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) El Toro. The 

proposed Raw Water Pump Station would be approximately 10 miles north of MCAS El Toro, 

while OC-33 would be 11 miles north. The air station was decommissioned in 1999. Therefore, 

construction and operation of the proposed project w
ould not affect air traffic patterns at the air 
station. There would be no impact.  
Traffic Load and Circulation Impact 3.12-1: Construction and operational acti
vity would affect traffic in the project area. 
(Less than Significant with Mitigation)  
During project construction, construction vehi
cles could result in short-term, intermittent 
lessening of roadway capacities due to slower movi
ng vehicles, and the larger turning radii of 
trucks (as compared to passenger vehicles). 
Traffic-generating construction activities would 
consist of the daily arrival and departure of c
onstruction workers, trucks hauling equipment and 
materials to and from the construction site, a
nd the hauling of excavated soils. Construction 
vehicles would access the Baker WTP site from Bisc
ayne Bay Drive to the north on a paved road

that currently traverses the undeveloped site. 
Construction equipment used for the proposed 
Baker WTP would include a dozer, a front end loader, a scraper, and three haul/dump trucks. 

Construction equipment used for the proposed 
treated water pipeline and sewer pipeline would 
include a backhoe, a front end loader, and a haul
 truck. Although some smaller vehicles (e.g., 
IRWD staff vehicles) traffic may access the site from Wisteria Lane, the majority of the 

construction traffic would be from the north. As 
a result, impacts to traffic and circulation from 
construction vehicles accessing the Baker 
site would be less than significant. Construction equipment used for the proposed Ra
w Water Pump Station would include a dozer, a 
haul truck, and a front end loader. Constr
uction vehicles would access the Raw Water Pump 
Station site without affecting local roadways. 
Construction activities for pipeline Option 2 may requ
ire closure of lanes of traffic in Peachwood Road. In addition, both pipeline options would bi
sect Marin, a small private road off Wisteria. 
Implementation of Mitigation Measure TR-1, re
quiring a Traffic Control/Traffic Management 
Plan, would ensure that construction activities would not significantly affect local access on these 

roads. Construction on the public streets would 
be between 9:30am and 3:00pm on arterials and 
7:30am and 5:00pm on local streets. 
Once constructed, access to the Baker WTP would 
be from Biscayne Bay Drive to the north and 
Wisteria to the south. If and when the planned future development north of the Baker site is 
completed, the northern access point to the Baker W
TP would be Indian Ocean Avenue instead of Biscayne Bay Drive (see Figure 2-5). On average, operational traffic would include up to three 

worker entries per day and up to 20 deliveries per month. Access from Wisteria requires a 90-

degree turn onto the plant property. This access 
point is feasible for some delivery trucks and 
IRWD staff vehicles; the entry point for large deliv
er trucks would be from the north. Due to the 
limited number of trips associated with operations of
 the plant, traffic and circulation on Biscayne 
Bay Drive and Palmwood/Wisteria would not be sign
ificantly impaired. Similarly, vehicle trips to 
the Raw Water Pump Station would not exceed one
 or two per week. Operations of the pump 
station would not adversely affect local traffi
c and circulation. Operation and maintenance 
requirements at OC-33 would not change due 
to the proposed meter exchange and pipeline 
replacement. There would be no impact to local tr
affic or circulation due to operational vehicle 
trips to OC-33. Mitigation Measures 
TR-1: For installation of Pipeline Option 1 and 2,
 the construction contractor shall prepare 
and implement a Traffic Control/Traffic Manageme
nt Plan prior to construction. The plan 
shall:  Identify hours of construction and hours for deliveries; 
 Include a work area delineation requiring traffic control and flagging; 
 Identify all access and parking restrictio
ns, pavement markings and signage 
requirements (e.g., speed limit, temporary loading zones);

 Maintain access to residence and business driv

e; Minimize access disruptions to businesses 
and residences;  Notify affected residents and businesses prior to the start of construction.; 
 Include a plan to coordinate all cons
truction activities with emergency service 
providers in the area at least one month in
 advance. Emergency service providers shall 
be notified of the timing, location, a
nd duration of construction activities.  
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.  Level of Service Standards 
Impact 3.12-2: Implementation of the proposed project could exceed a level of service 
standard established by the Orange County Transp
ortation Authority. (Less than Significant)  The OCTA is the designated Congestion Manage
ment Agency for Orange County. The OCTA 
prepares the Orange County Congestion Management
 Program (CMP), the goals of which are to 
reduce traffic congestion and provide a mechan
ism for coordinating land use and development 
decisions (OCTA, 2003). The CMP identifies co
st-effective improvements and strategies for 
mitigation of performance problems within the CM
P. The CMP is defined as a network of state highways and arterials, LOS standards and related 
procedures, and provides technical justification 
for the approach. LOS standards for roadways th
at are part of the Orange County CMP network 
are intended to regulate long-term traffic 
increases resulting from the operation of new 
development, and do not apply to temporary cons
truction projects. Therefore, for the proposed 
project, temporary construction-generated traffic wo
uld not result in any long-term degradation in 
operating conditions or LOS on any nearby roadways. There would be no impact.  
Operation of the Baker WTP would require frequent 
deliveries of chemicals, as listed in Table 2-1 
in the Project Description, and vehicle trips 
associated with operation and maintenance (O&M) 
vehicles. Deliveries would generate a total of approximately 20 truck trips per month, while O&M 
vehicles would generate approximately three trips 
per day. However, this number is negligible 
compared to the existing ADT estimate for the 
surrounding roadways such as Bake Parkway 
(43,000 ADT), Lake Forest Drive (34,000 ADT),
 and Trabuco Avenue (23,000 ADT). Thus, the 
frequency and number of trucks for scheduled de
liveries would not be great enough to result in 
degradation of traffic conditions or LOS on local
 roadways. The Raw Water Pump Station would 
be operated and monitored remotely using a SC
ADA system; there would be no additional O&M 
vehicle trips to operate the Raw Water Pump Stati
on. Impacts would be less than significant. There 
also would be no additional O&M vehicle trips to
 operate OC-33 relative to existing conditions.  
Mitigation Measures 
None required.

Incompatible Use Impact 3.12-3: The proposed project could s
ubstantially increase hazards due to a design 
feature or incompatible use. (Less than Significant with Mitigation)  
The proposed project involves construction and 
operation of water utility infrastructure and 
related facilities. The proposed project does not
 include the construction or design of any 
roadway infrastructure that would cause a safety 
risk to vehicle operations. Operation of the 
proposed project would require regular monthly de
liveries of hazardous materials to the Baker 
WTP. Delivery trucks would access the Baker W
TP via surrounding residential streets including 
Commercentre Drive, Biscayne Bay, Wisteria 
Lane, Palmwood Avenue, and a shared access road 
on Indian Ocean Drive. However, deliveries would not be frequent enough to increase hazards 
and cause degradation to streets (e.g., pot holes)
. The hazardous materials delivery trucks would 
be regulated by Caltrans. As described in Secti
on 3.7 Hazards and Hazardous Materials, chemical 
delivery vehicles would utilize state roadways approved by Caltrans for hazardous material 

transport (e.g., I-5 and SR-241). The City of Lake Forest does not designate which city streets can 

or cannot be used for hazardous material trans
port. Local roadway design is sufficient to 
accommodate the size and width of delivery truc
ks. Therefore, hazardous materials deliveries 
would not be an incompatible use. There would be no impact.  
Depending on the alignment chosen for the treat
ed water pipeline, construction activities could 
affect a small portion of Peachwood Avenue where the pipeline would connect to the South 

County Pipeline and a portion of private roadwa
ys such as Wisteria and Marin (Figure 2-2). 
These activities would introduce construction equipm
ent and oversized vehicles in and around 
these roadways that would potentia
lly increase hazards to passing motorists. Trucks slowing and 
turning from Peachwood Avenue could affect traffi
c and create traffic hazards. Implementation of 
a Traffic Control Plan, as described in Mitigation Measure TR-1, would minimize hazards to 
motorists and ensure that turning lanes and site 
access plans are implemented. Wisteria and Marin 
are private roads owned by the Serrano Highlands Homeowners Association (HOA). Mitigation Measure TR-2 would require IRWD to obtain an easement from the HOA for any pipelines to be 

installed within Wisteria or Marin or othe
rwise on any private property. The remaining 
construction activities would take place off-road
 and would therefore not increase roadway 
hazards. Impacts would be less than significant with mitigation.  
Mitigation Measures 
Implement 
Mitigation Measure TR-1
. TR-2: IRWD shall obtain the necessary road encr
oachment permits or easements prior to 
construction and would comply with the 
applicable conditions of approval.

Impact 3.12-4: The proposed project could result in inadequate emergency access. (Less 
than Significant with Mitigation)  
The proposed Baker WTP, treated water pipeline,
 and sewer pipeline are two miles from Orange 
County Fire Station #19, which is located at 23022 El Toro Road in the City of Lake Forest. 

Construction activities associated with the treated
 water pipeline could result in temporary lane 
closures of residential streets, including Wist
eria, Marin, and Palmwood Avenue. Per Mitigation 
Measure TR-1, IRWD would require 
the construction contractor to prepare a Traffic Control Plan that would require emergency access to be maintain
ed for the duration of construction activities. 
In addition, Mitigation Measure TR-3 would ensu
re that local emergency service providers are 
informed of lane/road closures and detours. 
Impacts would be less than significant with 
mitigation. The proposed Raw Water Pump Station is one mile 
from the nearest City of Orange Fire Station, 
which is located at 7401 E. Fort Road. Construc
tion and operation of the proposed pump station 
would not result in temporary roadway or lane cl
osures on local roadways within or around Peters 
Canyon Regional Park. There would be no impact
 to emergency access due to the proposed Raw 
Water Pump Station.   
The OC-33 site is approximately one mile from th
e OCFA Fire Station #7, located at 8501 E. Fort 
Road in the City of Orange. Construction and 
operation of the proposed meter exchange and 
pipeline replacement would not result in temporar
y roadway or lane closures on local roadways 
within or around Irvine Regional Park. There woul
d be no impact to emergency access due to the 
proposed OC-33 Meter Exchange. 
Mitigation Measures 
Implement 
Mitigation Measure TR-
1. TR-3: During construction of the treated water 
pipeline, IRWD shall require that the construction contractor notify the respon
sible law enforcement agencies and fire 
department two weeks prior to the start of 
work as to when and where construction would 
begin and end, and shall coordinate th
eir emergency access plans and procedures 
accordingly.  
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant.

CHAPTER 4 Cumulative Impacts 4.1  CEQA Analysis Requirements 
A cumulative impact is created as a result of the 
combination of the project evaluated in an EIR 
together with other projects causing related impacts. The 
CEQA Guidelines require that EIRs discuss the cumulative impacts of a project when th
e project™s incremental effect is ﬁcumulatively 
considerable,ﬂ meaning that the project™s increm
ental effects are considerable when viewed in 
connection with the effects of past, current, and probable future projects.
1 According to CEQA Guidelines §15130(a) and (b), the purpose of this section is to provide a discussion of significant 
cumulative impacts which reflects ﬁthe severity
 of the impacts and their likelihood of 
occurrence.ﬂ The CEQA Guidelines indicate that the discussion of cumulative impacts should 
include:   Either: (A), a list of past, present, and probable future projects producing related or cumulative impacts; or (B), a summary of projections contained in an adopted general 

plan or similar document, or in an adopte
d or certified environmental document, which 
described or evaluated conditions contributing to a cumulative impact; 
 A discussion of the geographic scope of the area affected by the cumulative effect; 
 A summary of expected environmental effect
s to be produced by these projects; and,  
 Reasonable, feasible options for mitigating or 
avoiding the project™s contribution to any 
significant cumulative effects. 
The analysis of cumulative effects in this 
chapter focuses on the effects of concurrent 
construction of the proposed project with other 
spatially and temporally proximate projects. As 
such this analysis relies on a list of projects th
at have the potential to contribute to cumulative 
impacts in the project area. 
4.2  Related Projects 
Cumulative impacts are assessed for related project within a similar geographic area. This 

geographic area may vary, depending upon the issu
e area discussed and the geographic extent of 
the potential impact. For example the geographic 
area associated with construction noise impacts 
is limited to areas directly adjacent to construc
tion sites, whereas the geographic area that is

 IRWD Baker Regional Water Treatment Plant

affected by construction-relate
d air emissions may include the 
larger airshed. Construction impacts associated with increased noise, dust, er
osion, and access limitations tend to be localized 
and could be exacerbated if othe
r development or improvement projects are occurring within the 
same or adjacent locations as the proposed project. 
Geographically, the proposed project is located 
in eastern Orange County along the foothills of 
the Cleveland National Forest, approximately 14 
miles east of the Pacific Ocean. For the purposes 
of this analysis, related projects within a five-m
ile radius around the project
 site were considered when evaluating potential cumulative impacts due 
to construction of the proposed project. The 
projects determined to be relevant to the analys
is of cumulative impacts for the proposed project 
are listed in Table 4-1 and are identified in 
Figure 4-1. As noted above, projects considered in this analysis include those that have recently been 
completed, are currently under construction, or ar
e in planning. Schedule is particularly relevant 
to the consideration of cumulative construction-re
lated impacts, since construction impacts tend 
to be relatively short-term. However, for future
 projects, construction schedules are often broadly 
estimated and can be subject to change. Although 
the timing of the future projects listed in Table 
4-1 are likely to fluctuate due to schedule changes or other unknown factors, this analysis 
assumes these projects would be implemented conc
urrently with construction of the proposed 
project between 2011 and 2012.
  
As described in
 Chapter 3 of this EIR, the majority of impacts associated with implementation of 
the proposed project are short-term and related 
to construction, rather than long-term project 
operation. Therefore, the project could contribut
e to cumulative effects 
when considered in 
combination with impacts of other construction projects in the project area
. For this analysis, 
other past, present, and reasonably-foreseeable futu
re construction projects, particularly other 
infrastructure, commercial, civic, and residentia
l development projects in the area have been 
identified. Long-term cumulative impacts of the project in conjunction with the other projects in 

the area are assessed as well. 

Table 4-1 lists current and proposed projects th
at could potentially contribute to cumulative 
impacts within the project area. In addition to
 the projects listed in Table 4-1, additional 
development that has not been identified as of this
 time, could occur within the project area, as 
planned by the City of Lake Forest, City of Ora
nge, City of Irvine, and the City of Tustin.

4.3 Cumulative Impacts and Mitigation Measures 

Construction of the proposed project is e
xpected to occur between 2011 and 2012. The 
construction schedule for the proposed faciliti
es depends on funding and permitting. For the 
purposes of this analysis, the related projects id
entified in Table 4-1 are all presumed to be 
implemented concurrently within the 2011 to
 2012 timeframe. These related projects, which 
include infrastructure, commercial, civic, and r
esidential development projects may contribute to 
certain types of cumulative construction impacts 
to air quality, hazards and hazardous materials, 
hydrology and water quality, noise a
nd vibration, and traffic and transportation, as described 
below. There would be no cumulative construction-related impacts to aesthetics; biological 

resources; cultural resources; geology and soils
; hazards and hazardous materials; land use and 
recreation; agriculture and forestry; or public 
services and utilities. Due to the nature of these 
resources as geographically confined, site specific,
 and/or distinct, any impacts can be mitigated 
for individual projects and collectively do not 
compound to create cumulatively considerable 
impacts. 
Impact 4-1: The proposed project, together with related projects, could create cumulative 
short-term construction impacts related to air quality, hydrology and water quality, noise 
and vibration, and traffic and transportation. (Less than Significant with Mitigation) Air Quality As explained in Chapter 3.2, Air Quality a
nd Greenhouse Gas Emissions, emissions associated 
with construction of the proposed project w
ould not exceed the SCAQMD™s thresholds and 
therefore would not be expected to be cumu
latively considerable. SCAQMD™s thresholds are 
intended to avoid significant cumulative impacts to 
the air basin, and protect air quality in the air 
basin. With respect to nearby, related past, 
present and/or foreseeable future projects with 
overlapping construction periods, it is possible th
at emission increases for certain air pollutants 
could exceed the SCAQMD™s emission threshol
ds. However, per CEQA Guidelines Section 
15064(h)(4), the mere existence of significan
t cumulative impacts caused by other related 
projects alone shall not constitute substantial evidence that the proposed project™s incremental 
effects are cumulatively considerable. Construction 
of the proposed project would not result in a 
cumulatively considerable net increase of any crite
ria pollutant. Impacts would be considered less than significant, and no mitigation is required.  
Hydrology and Water Quality 
As with the proposed project, all related projects are subject to the same federal CWA, State 

Porter Cologne Water Quality Control Act, and B
asin Plan regulations that protect water quality 
and water resources. These regulations incl
ude NPDES permit requirements, implementing 
SWPPPs, and post-development storm water quality and quantity requirements. All of these 
regulations are designed to address the incremental 
effects of individual projects such that they do 
not cause a cumulatively considerable impact. Ther
efore, despite the potential for construction of 
4. Cumulative Impacts 
 IRWD Baker Regional Water Treatment Plant
 4-6 ESA / D208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
the related projects to alter drainage patterns, runoff conditions, and storm water quality, the 
adherence to the aforementioned requirements 
would ensure that they do not result in 
cumulatively considerable impacts related to 
sedimentation, flooding, water quality, drainage 
storm water system capacity, and flood hazard areas.
 Therefore, when considered in combination 
with other developments similarly bound by 
the same regulations, the proposed project™s 
incremental contribution to water quality and 
quantity impacts would not be cumulatively 
considerable. No mitigation is required. 
Noise and Vibration 
The geographic scope of potential cumulative noise and vibration impacts encompasses the 

proposed construction sites and immediate vicini
ty. The proposed project™s construction activity 
would generate substantial noise levels in close proximity to 
sensitive receptors, particularly 
during the excavation and finishing phases of 
sewer pipeline installation and Baker WTP 
construction. Related projects in the surrounding 
area also would temporarily generate noise and 
vibration associated with construction activities; 
however noise and vibration would be localized, 
affecting areas in the immediate vicinity of th
e construction site. Construction noise associated 
with the proposed project would not combine 
with construction noise from neighboring related 
projects to cause a cumulative impact to the same
 sensitive receptors due to attenuation of sound 
and vibration as distance between source and 
receptor increases. Therefore, the proposed project™s contribution to construction noise imp
acts would not be cumulatively considerable. No 
mitigation is required. Traffic and Transportation 
Construction of the proposed project, together w
ith the identified related projects (Table 4-1), particularly in the vicinity of the Baker site, coul
d affect traffic and circulation in the project area. 
The effects of construction activities on traffic a
nd roadway hazards are due to an increase in the 
number of vehicles on local roadways (due to delivery of materials and worker commutes) and 

physical constraints on roadways if lane or street
 closures are required. The proposed project sites 
and staging areas largely would be constrained to
 the Baker site, Raw Water Pump Station site, 
and off-road pipeline alignments. However, construc
tion of Option 1 of the treated water pipeline could affect a small portion of Peachwood Avenue
 and a portion of private roadways such as 
Wisteria and Marin (Figure 2-2). These activities would introduce construction equipment and 
oversized vehicles in and around these roadways
 that would potentially increase hazards to 
passing motorists. Trucks slowing and turning 
from Peachwood Avenue could affect traffic and 
create traffic hazards. Implementation of a Tra
ffic Control Plan, as described in Mitigation 
Measure TR-1, would minimize hazards to motorist
s and ensure that turning lanes and site access 
plans are implemented. Wisteria and Marin are private roads owned by the Serrano Highlands 

Homeowners Association (HOA). Mitigation Measu
re TR-2 would require IRWD to obtain an 
easement from the HOA for any pipelines to be insta
lled within Wisteria or Marin or otherwise 
on any private property. The remaining constr
uction activities would take place off-road and 
would therefore not affect traffic or increase roadway hazards. Impacts would be less than 

significant with mitigation. 
4. Cumulative Impacts 
 IRWD Baker Regional Water Treatment Plant
 4-7 ESA / D208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
Some of the identified related projects could be constructed simultaneously in areas adjacent to or 
in close proximity to the proposed project. 
The addition of construction vehicles on local 
roadways due to the proposed project and related 
project could have cumulative impacts to traffic 
and vehicular hazards on local roadways. Impl
ementation of Mitigati
on Measure CUM-1 would require IRWD to coordinate cons
truction of the proposed project and the project™s Traffic Control 
Plan with the City of Lake Forest to ensure 
cumulative impacts to traffic and circulation are 
reduced to less than significant levels. With impl
ementation of this mitigation measure, impacts 
to traffic and circulation would not be cumulativ
ely considerable and would be considered less 
than significant. Mitigation Measure 
CUM-1: IRWD shall communicate and coordinate 
project construction activities and the 
project™s Traffic Control Plan with the City 
of Lake Forest. Phasing of project construction 
shall be coordinated to minimize cumula
tive impacts to traffic and circulation. 
Significance after Mitigation: Less than significant. 
Operation of the proposed project involves opera
tion of a new potable water treatment facility 
and distribution of potable water in southern Or
ange County. Cumulative impacts associated with 
operation of the proposed project would be related 
to the effects associated with the physical 
presence of new facilities, particularly aboveground facilities such as the proposed Baker WTP 

and Raw Water Pump Station. In addition, cumu
lative impacts would be related to maintenance 
and operation of the new facilities, such as electricity usage, delivery of chemicals to the Baker 
WTP, new IRWD staff, and generation of waste. The resources potentially affected by operation 

of the proposed project together with related 
projects listed in Table 4-1 are discussed below. There would be no cumulative operational impact
s to agricultural and forestry resources; 
biological resources; cultural resources; hazards
 and hazardous materials; geology, soils and 
mineral resources; land use and recreation; noise and vibration; and public services. Operation of 
the proposed project either has no impact to
 these resources or, due to the nature of these 
resources as geographically confined, site specific,
 and/or distinct, any impacts can be mitigated 
for individual projects and collectively do not 
compound to create cumulatively considerable 
impacts. 
Impact 4-2: Operation of the proposed project, together with related projects, could create 
cumulative impacts to aesthetics, air quality, 
storm water runoff and facilities, and traffic 
and transportation. (Less than Significant) Aesthetics Two of the related projects (Table 4-1) are located directly adjacent to the project site and 
possibly within the same line of sight as the pr
oposed project: the Shea/Baker Ranch project and 
the Irvine Ranch Water District /Lewis project
. The proposed Baker WTP would be constructed 
largely within the footprint of the existing BFP. 
As part of the Project Description (Chapter 2), 
4. Cumulative Impacts 
 IRWD Baker Regional Water Treatment Plant
 4-8 ESA / D208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
the aboveground Baker WTP facilities would be desi
gned to be compatible with the existing and 
future planned neighboring reside
ntial development and parks and existing buildings at the Baker 
site, such as the office building and storage build
ing (see Figure 3.1-1). As described in Chapter 3.1 Aesthetics, development of the Baker site w
ould not have significant impacts to the visual 
character of the site or to scenic vistas in the project area. 
When considered individually and cumulatively, 
implementation of related projects could have 
substantial impacts to the visual character of 
sites in the project area and to scenic vistas. Currently, sites proposed for development in the vi
cinity of the Baker site are characterized by 
open space or vacant land. Although impacts associ
ated with these related projects could be 
significant, the proposed project would not have 
a cumulatively considerable incremental impact 
to aesthetics due to the existing baseline conditions 
at the Baker site, which is already developed 
with treatment facilities that are visible from 
surrounding roadways and ridgelines. No mitigation 
measures are required.  
There are no related projects close to the proposed
 Raw Water Pump Station that together with 
the proposed project would affect visual character of the site or scenic vistas. There would be no 

cumulative impacts to aesthetics associated w
ith the proposed Raw Water Pump Station.  
Air Quality As discussed in Chapter 3.2 Air Quality and 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the operational impacts 
of the proposed project would not exceed the SC
AQMD™s thresholds and therefore would not be 
expected to be cumulatively considerable. With 
respect to nearby, related past, present and/or 
foreseeable future projects, it is possible that 
emission increases for certain air pollutants could 
exceed the SCAQMD™s emission thresholds. 
However, per CEQA Guidelines Section 
15064(h)(4), the mere existence of significan
t cumulative impacts caused by other related 
projects alone shall not constitute substantial evidence that the proposed project™s incremental 
effects are cumulatively considerable. Development 
of the proposed project would not result in a 
cumulatively considerable net increase of any cr
iteria pollutant. No mitigation is required.  
Storm Water Runoff and Facilities 
Implementation of related projects in the vici
nity of the Baker site would introduce new 
impervious surfaces into the Serrano Creek draina
ge area. Related projects immediately adjacent 
to the Baker site would be located on sites characterized by open space and vacant land. 
Improvements made as a result of these development projects would introduce new structures and 

paved surfaces to these sites that would alter the 
runoff and drainage patte
rns, which could have 
significant impacts to storm water runoff volume 
and water quality and could require new storm 
water drainage facilities. When considered toge
ther with these related projects, the proposed 
project could have a cumulative impact on stor
m flows and flood elevations in Serrano Creek. 
However, as described in Chapter 3.8, Hydrolog
y and Water Quality, the proposed project itself would not result in substantial increases in ru
noff from the Baker site relative to existing 
conditions. The proposed Baker WTP would not 
add substantial amounts 
of new impervious 
surfaces and would not significantly affect stor
m water runoff, water quality, or flooding. The 
4. Cumulative Impacts 
 IRWD Baker Regional Water Treatment Plant

Final EIR 
April 2011 
proposed project would not have a cumulatively-c
onsiderable incremental impact to storm water 
volume, quality or flooding when considered toge
ther with related projects and would not have 
cumulatively considerable impact to storm water 
drainage facilities. No mitigation is required.  
Traffic and Transportation 
Planned growth, as described in the City of Lake
 Forest General Plan and EIR, City of Lake 
Forest Opportunities Study and EIR, and City of Orange General Plan and EIR would continue to 
contribute to overall traffic in the region. The prop
osed residential, commercial, and civic projects 
listed in Table 4-1 would be part of the planned 
growth approved by the cities in the project area. Increases in ADT on local and regional roadways
 and decreases in LOS could result due to 
implementation of the related projects, which are 
residential, commercial, and civic developments 
that would generate traffic. Combined, the rela
ted projects would introduce over 4,750 residential 
housing units of various sizes to the region which would affect traffic volume on roadways. The 

operational vehicle trips associated with the prop
osed project would be limited to the delivery of 
chemicals (up to 20 deliveries per month) and ope
rational and maintenance staff vehicle trips.  
Relative to the traffic loads on roadways as describ
ed in Chapter 3.12, Traffic and Circulation, 
impacts of the proposed project to traffic would 
not be significant. In addition, relative to the 
potential new traffic loads associated with related 
projects, the proposed project would not have a 
cumulatively-considerable impact on ADT, LOS, or
 alternative transportation. No mitigation is 
required. Greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts are considered to be
 exclusively cumulative impacts; there are no 
non-cumulative greenhouse gas emission impacts 
from a climate change perspective (CAPCOA, 
2008). Greenhouse gas emissions are discussed in Chapter 3.2, Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions. The proposed project would not have 
a cumulatively-considerable impact on GHGs or 
global climate change and would not conflict w
ith the State™s ability to meet AB32 goals. See 
Chapter 3.2 for a detailed discussion of impact.

CHAPTER 5  Growth Inducement 5.1 Introduction The CEQA Guidelines (§15126.2(d)) require that an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) evaluate 
the growth-inducing impacts of a proposed action.
 Section 15126.2(d) calls for the EIR to:  
Discuss the way in which a proposed project 
could foster economic or population growth, 
or the construction of additi
onal housing, either directly or 
indirectly, in the surrounding environment. Included in this are projects which would remove obstacles to population 
growth (a major expansion of a reclaimed water treatment plant might, for example, allow 
for more construction in service areas). In
creases in the population may tax existing 
community service facilities, requiring construction of new facilities that could cause 
significant environmental effects. Also discuss the characteristic of some projects which 
may encourage and facilitate other activities that could significantly affect the 

environment, either individually or cumulatively. It must not be assumed that growth in any 
area is necessarily beneficial, detrimental, or of little sign
ificance to the environment.  A project can have direct and/or indirect growth
 inducement potential. Direct growth would result 
if a project, for example, involved construction 
of new housing. A project would have indirect 
growth inducement potential if it establishe
d substantial new permanent employment 
opportunities (e.g., commercial, industrial or go
vernmental enterprises) or if it involved a construction effort with subs
tantial short-term employment opportunities that indirectly 
stimulated the need for additional housing and 
services to support the new employment demand. 
Similarly, a project would indirectly induce growth
 if it removed an obstacle to additional growth 
and development, such as removing a constraint
 on a required public service, such as potable 
water or wastewater treatment capacity. 
A project that is determined to be growth indu
cing can result in subsequent environmental effects 
as a result of such growth. These environmental e
ffects are considered indirect secondary effects 
of growth. Secondary effects of growth can resu
lt, for example, in significant increased demand 
on community and public service infrastructure; increased traffic and noise; degradation of air 

and water quality; and conversion of agricultural land to urban uses. 
5.2 Direct and Indirect Growth Inducement Implementation of the proposed project would ha
ve no potential to directly foster population 
growth or to result in the construction of additiona
l housing. Project construction is not expected to

create substantial employment opportunities beyond 
the level normally available to construction 
workers in the area. Construction of the proposed 
project would require approximately 80 workers. 
In general, workers are expected to be drawn 
from the local labor pool. Therefore, the proposed 
project would have no direct impacts on growth. 
As previously described in Chapter 2, Project De
scription, the objectives of the proposed project 
are to:  Improve water reliability to areas of south Or
ange County by constructing local treatment 
capability for a variable supply source (imported water from MWD and local Irvine Lake 

water). 
 Provide a reliable, local potable water supply in the event of emergency conditions or 
scheduled maintenance of MWD™s delivery system. 
 Increase operational flexibility by creati
ng redundancy within the raw water supply 
system. 
The proposed project would increase water supply 
reliability in southern Orange County by 
creating redundancy of treatment system capacity
 for potable water (non-irrigation use). The 
proposed Baker WTP would provide redundant treatment capacity to MWD™s Diemer Filtration 
Plant and would also have the capability to tr
eat variable raw water supply sources, including 
imported water and Irvine Lake wa
ter. Imported water treated at
 the Baker WTP would be in 
place of, rather than in addition to, water treated at the Diemer Filtration Plant. The intermittent 
raw water provided via Irvine Lake would not 
be a dependable supply and would not be a 
constant reliable source of water that could in
duce growth. The proposed project would not result 
in an increase in potable water supplies and would not remove an obstacle to growth. The 
proposed project is not necessary to alleviate curre
nt or future demand at the Diemer Filtration Plant. If the proposed project is not implemented,
 the Diemer Filtration Plant would continue to 
provide imported water to IRWD and the partne
r agencies to provide potable water to meet 
current and future demand. Potable water treatment capacity currently is not considered an 
obstacle to growth. The proposed project would not 
remove an obstacle to growth and thus would 
not indirectly induce growth. 
The proposed project would not directly or indirectly induce growth. Accordingly, the proposed 
project would not result in any secondary effects of growth.

CHAPTER 6  Alternatives Analysis 6.1 CEQA Requirement for Alternatives Analysis CEQA requires that an EIR describe and evaluate 
a reasonable range of feasible alternatives to a 
project or to the location of a project that would avoid or substantially lessen significant project 
impacts and attain most of the project objectives. CEQA Guidelines (§15126.6) set forth the 

following criteria for alternatives:  
 Identifying Alternatives. 
The range of alternatives is lim
ited to those that would avoid 
or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project attain most of the 

objectives of the project, and are feasible. Factors that may be considered when 

addressing the feasibility of an alternative 
include site suitability, availability of 
infrastructure, general plan consistency,
 other plans or regulatory limitations, 
jurisdictional boundaries, economic viability, 
and whether the proponent can reasonably 
acquire, control or otherwise have access to th
e alternative site. An EIR need not consider 
an alternative whose impact cannot be r
easonably ascertained and whose implementation 
is remote and speculative. CEQA also specifically requires consideration of the ‚no 

project™ alternative, which addresses the impa
ct of not building the project and addresses what could occur in the foreseeable future if the project is not approved  The EIR should 
identify alternatives considered but rejected
 as infeasible during the scoping process and 
briefly explain the reasons underlying such determination. 
 Range of Alternatives. An EIR need not consider every conceivable alternative, but 
must consider a reasonable range of altern
atives that will foster informed decision-
making and public participation. The ﬁr
ule of reasonﬂ governs the selection and 
consideration of EIR alternatives, requiring that an EIR set forth only those alternatives necessary to permit a reasoned choice.  
 Evaluation of Alternatives. 
EIRs are required to include sufficient information about 
each alternative to allow meaningful eval
uation, analysis, and comparison with the 
project. Matrices may be used to display the 
major characteristics of each alternative and 
significant environmental effects of each a
lternative to summarize the comparison. If an 
alternative would cause one or more significant 
effects in addition to those that would be 
caused by the project as proposed, the signifi
cant effects of the alternative must be 
discussed but in less detail than the significant effects of the project.

6.2 Project Objectives As described in Chapter 2, Project Descri
ption, the project objectives are as follows: 
 Improve water reliability to areas of south Or
ange County by constructing local treatment 
capability for a variable supply source (imported water from MWD and local Irvine Lake 

water). 
 Provide a reliable, local potable water supply in the event of emergency conditions or 
scheduled maintenance of MWD™s delivery system (e.g., AMP, Lower Feeder, Diemer 

Filtration Plant). 
 Increase operational flexibility by creati
ng redundancy within the raw water supply 
system. 
6.3 Key Impacts of the Proposed Project  Chapter 3 of this EIR identifies potential impact
s associated with the proposed project for each 
environmental issue area including long-term and 
short-term impacts. M
itigation measures have 
been identified to render impacts less than signi
ficant. No significant unavoidable impacts would 
result from implementation of the proposed project
. A summary of the significant of impacts for 
each environmental resource analyzed in 
Chapters 3 and 4 is presented below in

Final EIR 
April 2011 
6.4 Alternatives Eliminated from Further Consideration An EIR must briefly describe the rationale for sel
ection and rejection of alternatives. The Lead 
Agency may make an initial determination as to 
which alternatives are potentially feasible and, 
therefore, merit in-depth consideration, and wh
ich are clearly infeasible. Alternatives that are 
remote or speculative, or the effects of whic
h cannot be reasonably predicted, need not be 
considered (CEQA Guidelines, Section 15126.6(f)(3)). This section identifies alternatives considered by the Lead Agency, but rejected as in
feasible, and provides a brief explanation of the 
reasons for their exclusion. Alternatives may be 
eliminated from detailed consideration in the EIR 
if they fail to meet most of the project objec
tives, are infeasible, or do not avoid any significant 
environmental effects (
CEQA Guidelines
, Section 15126.6(c)). 
No Raw Water Pump Station Alternative 
IRWD investigated the potential to supply raw 
water to the Baker WTP by gravity from both the 
Santiago Lateral and Irvine Lake
, avoiding the need for the Raw Water Pump Station. Such 
operation would involve gravity flow from the 
Santiago Lateral as a normal operating condition, 
and gravity flow from Irvine Lake into the Ba
ker Pipeline during emergency conditions. Under 
this alternative, no new construction would be requi
red at the existing Intertie site near Peters Canyon Reservoir. However, hydraulics analysis 
for the emergency condition revealed that raw 
water supply would have to be reduced to less th
an half of normal operating capacity (43.5 cfs). 
The alternative was rejected due to its li
mitations in supplying water during emergency 
conditions and meeting the main objective of th
e proposed project, which is to increase water 
supply reliability to southern Orange County. In
 addition, there would be no significant, 
unavoidable environmental impacts that would be 
avoided by implementing this alternative and 
eliminating the Raw Water Pump Station from the proposed project. 
Reduced Capacity Alternative 
IRWD considered a range of capacities for the 
Baker WTP, including alternatives that would 
reduce plant capacity below the proposed project (43.5 cfs). By developing civil and mechanical 

plans for the various facilities it was determin
ed that for a plant with less capacity, the 
construction footprint and modifications at OC-
33, the Raw Water Pump Station, and the Baker 
WTP forebay would be approximately the same 
as the proposed project. Therefore, the Reduced 
Capacity Alternative was rejected becau
se there would be no significant, unavoidable 
environmental impacts avoided by reducing plant capacity, given the similar construction 

footprints and modifications required. In addition,
 this alternative would constrain the potential 
increase in water supply reliability, which is the main objective of the proposed project, by 

restricting plant capacity. 
 6.5 Project Alternatives An EIR must describe a range of reasonable altern
atives to the proposed project or alternative project locations that could feasibly attain most 
of the basic project objectives and would avoid or

substantially lessen any of the significant envir
onmental impacts to the proposed project. The 
alternatives analysis must include the ﬁNo Project
 Alternativeﬂ as a point of comparison. The No 
Project Alternative includes existing conditions a
nd reasonably foreseeable future conditions that 
would exist if the proposed project were not approved (
CEQA Guidelines §15126.6). CEQA also 
requires that an EIR identify an environmentally superior alternative (
CEQA Guidelines
 §15126.6[e][2]). Following is a discussion of three alternatives, including the No Project 

Alternative. The analyses for Alternatives 1 and 
2 address those environmental topics most likely 
to change.   
Pursuant to Section 15126.6(e)(2) of the 
CEQA Guidelines, the No Project Alternative shall: –discuss the existing conditions at the time the 
notice of preparation is published, or if no 
notice of preparation is published, at the tim
e the environmental analysis is commenced, as 
well as what would be reasonably expected to occur in the foreseeable future if the project 
were not approved, based on current plans and c
onsistent with available infrastructure and 
community services. 
Under the No Project Alternative, IRWD would not implement the proposed project; there would 
be no construction of the proposed Raw Water Pump
 Station, Baker WTP, sewer pipeline, treated 
water conveyance pipeline, or OC-33 meter exch
ange. The Baker site would remain unchanged 
and the Baker/Irvine Lake Pipeline Intertie also would remain unchanged. The BFP would 
continue to provide filtered well water to suppl
ement IRWD™s recycled water system and the 
antennae tower would continue to operate as part of IRWD™s existing district-wide SCADA 
system. The Diemer Filtration Plant would continue to provide treatment for imported water for 

IRWD and the partner agencies in south Orange County.
 Raw water in Irvine Lake would 
continue to be utilized for agricultural irrigation.   
Ability to Meet Project Objectives 
Under the No Project Alternative, none of the 
project objectives would be achieved. There would 
be no improvements to water supply reliability in 
south Orange County, no increase in local water 
treatment capability for variable supply sources, 
and no redundancy in raw water supply systems 
to provide operational flexibility. 
Impact Analysis 
Under the No Project Alternative, the impacts identif
ied in Chapters 3 and 4 of this Draft EIR that 
are associated with construction and operation 
of the proposed project would be avoided. The 
Diemer Filtration Plant would continue to pr
ovide imported water to IRWD and the partner agencies. MWD™s current and future
 plans for the Diemer Filtration Plant include expectations to 
provide treated water to IRWD and the partner 
agencies. Therefore, no additional environmental 
impacts would occur under the No Project Alternative.  
6. Alternatives Analysis 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 6-5 ESA / 208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 

In 2007, the Santiago Aqueduct Commission (SAC) prepared the 
Baker Pipeline Regional Treatment Facility Feasibility Study (Malcolm Pirnie, 2007), which evaluated implementation of 
a regional WTP at two locations, the existing Bake
r site and the Peters Canyon WTP. Alternative 
1 consists of development of th
e Peters Canyon WTP, which is 
owned by the East Orange County 
Water District (EOCWD) and is located in the C
ounty of Orange approximately 0.35 miles east 
of Peters Canyon Reservoir. The site is surroun
ded by open space in the foothills of the Santa 
Ana Mountains and is within the boundaries of the Loma Ridge portion of the Irvine Ranch 

Natural Landmark. The Peters Canyon WTP, cons
tructed in 1963, is currently decommissioned 
and has a rated capacity of approximately 9 cfs. 
Under Alternative 1, IRWD would form a JPA or 
otherwise contract with EOCWD for use of 
the Peters Canyon WTP site and implement 
improvements similar to the proposed project, to
 produce 28 mgd of treated water using either 
imported water or Irvine Lake water as the ra
w water source. The Raw Water Pump Station 
would be necessary, similar to the proposed project, 
in order to convey Irvine Lake water to the 
site. In addition, a new connection to the AMP woul
d be required for distribution of treated water.  
The 2007 Feasibility Study evaluated both the Pe
ters Canyon WTP site and the Baker site, 
applying several alternatives screening crite
ria, including proximity to existing system 
infrastructure, utilities availability, facility c
ondition/seismic upgrading, site access, compatibility 
with the surrounding land uses, environmental imp
acts, and permit requirements (Malcolm Pirnie, 
2007).  
Ability to Meet Project Objectives 
Under Alternative 1, all project objectives would be
 met. Under Alternative 1, construction of the 
Peters Canyon WTP would result in improvement
s to water supply reliability in south Orange 
County, increases in local water treatment capab
ility for variable supply sources, and redundancy 
in the raw water supply system to provide operational flexibility. 
Impact Analysis 
Under Alternative 1, the impacts would be similar 
to those described in Chapter 3 and 4, with the exception of aesthetics, air quality, biological r
esources, hazards and hazardous materials, land 
use, energy and GHGs, and noise.  
Aesthetics
: The proposed project would result in less 
than significant impacts to aesthetics with 
mitigation incorporated (see Section 3.1). Unde
r Alternative 1, development of a WTP would 
occur in an area in which no other development cu
rrently exists. The Peters Canyon WTP site is 
located within the Loma Ridge portion of the 
Irvine Ranch Natural Landmark and surrounded by 
open space. The Peters Canyon WTP site is also in close proximity and visible from State Route 

(SR) 241 and SR 261. Expansion of the site to accommodate a treatment plant would have minor 

impacts to the visual character of the site 
and its surroundings. Neither SR 241 or SR 261 are 
designated or eligible state scenic highways. 
However, expansion of the Peters Canyon WTP 
6. Alternatives Analysis 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 6-6 ESA / 208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
would affect the scenic vistas viewed from these ro
adways. Jamboree Road, in the vicinity of the 
site, is designated by the City of Orange as a 
viewscape corridor. However, the Peters Canyon 
WTP site is not visible from Jamboree Road due 
to the rolling topography that blocks views of 
the site from the roadway. As compared to the 
proposed project, Alternative 1 would result in 
minor additional impacts to aesthetics relative to the proposed project. 
Air Quality: The proposed project would result in less than significant impacts to air quality (see 
Section 3.3). Under Alternative 1, expansion 
of the decommissioned Peters Canyon WTP would 
require extensive grading and fill. The Peters Cany
on WTP site is smaller than the Baker site and 
expansion would be constrained by the topogr
aphy and land uses of surrounding parcels. The 
Peters Canyon WTP site also lacks any existi
ng constructed storage, such as the two 16-MG 
storage tanks already at the Baker site. Acco
rding to the 2007 Feasibility Study, the practical 
maximum capacity of a treatment plant at this 
site likely would be 10 mgd. In order to create 
sufficient space for a 28 mgd treatment plant, extensive grading and fill would be required. Under 
Alternative 1, grading and earthmoving activities would be more extensive than the proposed 

project. This would result in additional air emi
ssions associated with construction equipment 
operation and the generation of fugitive dust due to
 grading and earthmoving. As compared to the 
proposed project, Alternative 1 would resu
lt in greater impacts to air quality. 
Biological Resources and Land Use Compatibility
: The proposed project would result in less 
than significant impacts to biological resour
ces with mitigation measures incorporated (see 
Section 3.4) and less than significant impacts to land use without mitigation (see Section 3.9). 

Alternative 1 would be located at the now deco
mmissioned Peters Canyon WTP site, within the 
Loma Ridge portion of the Irvine Ranch Natura
l Landmark. Approximately 40,000 acres of open 
space within the historic Irvine Ranch have been designated as a Natural Landmark by both the 
State of California and the U.S. Department of th
e Interior. The land is protected and maintained 
cooperatively by landowners a
nd managers, including California State Parks, the County of 
Orange, and The Irvine Company. The land contains
 rare and valuable biological and geological 
features, including species biodiversity, natura
l communities such as coastal sage scrub, rock 
formations and fossils. Under Alternative 1, construction of the 
Peters Canyon WTP would have 
the potential to result in greater impacts to speci
al-status species and habitats. In addition, under 
Alternative 1, expansion of the site to accomm
odate a 28-mgd plant would have the potential to 
be incompatible with land use designations of ne
ighboring parcels within the Natural Landmark. 
As compared to the proposed project, Alternativ
e 1 would result in greater impacts to biological 
resources and land use compatibility.   
Hazards and Hazardous Materials
: The proposed project would result in less than significant 
impacts due to hazards and hazardous material
s with mitigation measures incorporated (see 
Section 3.7). Similar to the proposed project, Alternative 1 would require the transport, use, and 

disposal of hazardous materials during both c
onstruction and operation 
of the Peters Canyon 
WTP. However, Alternative 1 would be located in 
an area that is not proximate to residential land 
uses like the proposed project. As a result, the pot
ential impacts to sensitiv
e receptors associated 
with release of hazardous materials would be less under Alternative 1.    
6. Alternatives Analysis 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 6-7 ESA / 208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
Energy and GHGs: The proposed project would result in l
ess than significant impacts related to 
energy and GHGs (see Section 3.3). Under Alterna
tive 1, due to site elevation and location, pumping facilities would be required at the Pete
rs Canyon WTP. These pumping facilities would 
require additional power usage relative to the 
proposed project. The additional energy usage 
would result in an incremental increase in GHG em
issions relative to the proposed project. As 
compared to the proposed project, Alternative 
1 would result in more GHG emissions than the 
proposed project. 
Noise: The proposed project would result in l
ess than significant impacts with mitigation 
measures incorporated (see Section 3.10). Under Alternative 1, there would be no sensitive receptors in close proximity to the site, and as 
a result, noise associated with construction activity 
would not affect sensitive receptors, such as resi
dential land uses. The Peters Canyon WTP site is 
located within the Loma Ridge portion of the 
Irvine Ranch Natural Landmark and surrounded by 
open space. The site is also approximately 250 
feet from State Route 261. Alternative 1 would 
avoid the noise impacts associated with construc
tion at the Baker site under the proposed project. 
As compared to the proposed project, Alterna
tive 1 would result in fewer noise impacts.   
Impact Summary 
Alternative 1 would meet all of the goals of the 
project. Alternative 1 would result in greater or more severe impacts to the environment related 
to aesthetics, air quality, biological resources, 
land use compatibility, and energy and GHGs. A
lternative 1 would result in lesser impacts 
associated with hazardous materials and noise.   

The 2007 Feasibility Study (Malcolm Pirnie, 200
7) evaluated conventional treatment as an alternative to membrane filtration. Under Altern
ative 2, IRWD would construct a new treatment 
plant at the Baker site using a conventional treatment process instead of a membrane filtration 
process. A conventional treatment process typi
cally would require facilities such as primary 
treatment facilities (flocculation and sedimentation basins), secondary filtration facilities, 

disinfection facilities (chlorine contactor, UV facility
), an equalization basin, and solids handling 
facilities (thickener, belt filter presses, solids dispo
sal). Although this Alternative would meet all of 
the project objectives, conventional treatment requires a greater footprint than a membrane filtration 
process. In addition, conventional treatment requi
res more chemical use and has greater sludge 
disposal requirements. Conventional treatment is 
also less favored by the California Department of 
Public Health, and is slightly more expensive to
 build, operate, and maintain. However, according to the Feasibility Study, conventional treatment is 
a proven, reliable and low-cost treatment (despite 
the slightly higher costs of construction, operation 
and maintenance), and is considered viable for 
the Baker WTP.   
6. Alternatives Analysis 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 6-8 ESA / 208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
Ability to Meet Project Objectives 
Under Alternative 2, all project objectives would 
be met. Construction of conventional treatment 
plant at the Baker WTP would also result in improvements to water supply reliability in south 

Orange County, increases in local water treatment capability for variable supply sources, and 

redundancy in the raw water supply system
 to provide operational flexibility. 
Impact Analysis 
Under Alternative 2, the impacts would be similar 
to those described in Chapter 3 and 4, with the exception of aesthetics, air quality, hazardous materials, energy and GHGs, and noise.  
Aesthetics: 
The proposed project would result in less th
an significant impacts to aesthetics with 
mitigation incorporated (see Section 3.1). Unde
r Alternative 2, construction of new facilities 
would be required, within the existing Baker s
ite. These facilities would differ from the proposed 
project and would include open ponds and add
itional structures that, even with mature 
landscaping, could possibly be seen from areas in th
e vicinity of the Baker site. Similar to the 
proposed project, views from public roadways and 
residences immediately west and south of the 
Baker site would be mostly obstructed due to 
site topography that includes a bluff along the 
perimeter. Public views of the site from elev
ated locations and residences further south and 
southeast of the site across Serrano Creek would 
include the site™s new structures, such as open 
ponds. These locations would be in a position to 
see new light and glare from new structures and 
open water features associated with Alternativ
e 2. As compared to the proposed project, 
Alternative 2 would be considered to ha
ve slightly greater aesthetic impacts. 
Air Quality: The proposed project would result in less than significant impacts to air quality (see 
Section 3.3). Under Alternative 2, demolition of 
most, if not all, existing buildings and new 
construction of a water treatment plant using 
conventional processing would result in a longer demolition/construction period over a greater period 
of time than contemplated for the proposed 
project. As a result, air emissions during construc
tion would be greater relative to the proposed 
project.  Under Alternative 2, treatment pro
cesses would result in greater solids handling and 
create the potential for more odors during plant operation. As compared to the proposed project, 

Alternative 2 would result in greater im
pacts related to air quality and odor. 
Hazards and Hazardous Materials
: The proposed project would result in less than significant 
impacts due to hazards and hazardous material
s with mitigation measures incorporated (see 
Section 3.7). Similar to the proposed project, Alternative 2 would require the transport, use, and 

disposal of hazardous materials during both cons
truction and operation of the proposed treatment 
facilities at the Baker site. However, Alternative 
2 would involve treatment processes that require 
more chemical use relative to the proposed project
. As a result, the potential impacts to sensitive 
receptors and the environment associated with release of hazardous materials would be greater 

under Alternative 2.    
Energy and GHGs: The proposed project would result in l
ess than significant impacts related to 
energy and GHGs (see Section 3.3). Under Altern
ative 2, the proposed conventional treatment 
6. Alternatives Analysis 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant

Final EIR 
April 2011 
processes would require less energy than membra
ne processes that are part of the proposed 
project. Therefore, operation of Alternative 2 would have fewer impacts to energy and GHGs 

relative to the proposed project. 
Noise: The proposed project would result in l
ess than significant impacts with mitigation 
measures incorporated (see Section 3.10). Under Alternative 2, demolition and construction 
activities would occur over a longer period of 
time near sensitive receptors, which include 
residences west, southwest and southeast of the pr
oject site. In addition, conventional treatment 
processes generally generate more noise, relative to membrane processes, since fewer pieces of 

operational equipment are housed within buildi
ngs that can dampen noise. As a result, as 
compared to the proposed project, Alternative 2 w
ould result in greater impacts to noise levels.  
Impact Summary 
Although Alternative 2 would meet all of the goals
 of the project, as compared to the proposed 
project, Alternative 2 would result in greater imp
acts to the environment related to aesthetics, air 
quality (construction impacts), odor, hazardous ma
terials, and noise. As compared to the 
proposed project, Alternative 2 would result in fe
wer operational impacts to energy and GHGs.   
6.6 Summary of Alternatives Analysis 
A summary of the alternatives analysis is provided in 
Table 6-2, which provides a comparison of 
the proposed project to each alternative with respect to project objectives and project impacts. The 
alternatives evaluated in this EIR present a 
tradeoff between achieving project objectives and 
impacting the environment. The No Project Altern
ative would avoid all the environmental impacts 
of the proposed project but would not meet any of the project objectives. Alternatives 1 and 2 

would meet all of the project objectives but could 
result in additional impacts to the environment 
relative to the proposed project. 
6.7  Environmentally Superior Alternative 
An EIR must identify the environmentally superior alternative. In addition, the 
CEQA Guidelines
 (Section 15126.6(e)(2)) require that, if the environmentally superior alternative is the No Project 
Alternative, the EIR shall also identify an envi
ronmentally superior alternative among the other 
alternatives.  
The No Project Alternative would result in the 
least environmental impacts because there would 
be no physical changes to the environment as a result of the proposed project. All impacts 

associated with the proposed project would 
be avoided. In accordance with CEQA, an environmentally superior alternative shall 
be identified among the project alternatives. 
Alternatives 1 and 2 would not likely result in 
significant and unavoidable impacts. However, 
both would increase the severity of impacts associated with some environmental resources while

  decreasing impacts associated with others. 
For Alternative 1, the increase in potential environmental impacts (to aesthetics, constructi
on-related air emissions, biological resources, 
land use compatibility, and energy) outweighs 
the potential decrease in impacts (to noise and 
hazardous materials), when compared to the prop
osed project. Therefore Alternative 1 is not 
considered environmentally superior to the proposed project. 
Similarly, for Alternative 2, the increase in 
potential environmental impacts (to aesthetics, 
construction-related air emissions, hazardous ma
terials, and noise) outweighs the potential 
decrease in impacts (to energy and GHG emissions
), when compared to the proposed project. 
Therefore Alternative 2 also is not considered e
nvironmentally superior to the proposed project. 
As a result, the proposed project is considered
 the Environmentally Superior Alternative.

Brown Jr. Governor PLANNING & WATER RESOURCES H:H 11 lOll IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY OF A DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR THE IRWD BAKER WATER TREATMENT PLANT PROJECT, ORANGE COUNTY Dear Mr. Weghorst: The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) has received your submitted Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the above-mentioned project. The following project description is stated in your document: "The Irvine Ranch Water District (IRWD) is proposing to construct the proposed project to provide increased water supply reliability in southern Orange County by creating redundancy of treatment system capacity for potable water. The proposed Baker Water Treatment Plant (WTP) would have a normal operating capacity of 43.5 cubic feet per second (28 million gallons per day) and would treat raw water from variable supply sources. The proposed Baker WTP would be constructed on tne southernmost portion of a 98-acre parcel located at 21082 Wisteria in the City of Lake Forest, at the site of the existing Baker Filtration Plant (BFP). The proposed Raw Water Pump Station would be located near Peter Canyon Reservoir at 9737Peters Canyon Road in the City of Orange, at the site of the existing Baker/lrvine Lake Pipeline Intertie facilities. The proposed project requires a meter exchange and pipeline replacement at OC-33, which is located in an unincorporated area of then County of Orange in the hills east of Irvine Regional Park. The aboveground Baker WTP facilities would be designed to be compatible with existing buildings onsite at the BFP". @ Printp.rl nn Rp.r.vr.lp.rl P:lnp.r Mr. Paul Weghorst February 8, 2011 Page 2 Based on the review of the submitted document DTSC has the following comments: 1) The EIR should evaluate whether conditions within the Project area may pose a threat to human health or the environment. Following are the databases of some of the regulatory agencies: Ł National Priorities List (NPL): A list maintained by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.EPA). Ł EnviroStor (formerly CaISites): A Database primarily used by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, accessible through DTSC's website (see below). Ł Resource Conservation and Recovery Information System (RCRIS): A database of RCRA facilities that is maintained by U.S. EPA. Ł Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Information System (CERCLlS): A database of CERCLA sites that is maintained by U.S.EPA. Ł Solid Waste Information System (SWIS): A database provided by the California Integrated Waste Management Board which consists of both open as well as closed and inactive solid waste disposal facilities and transfer stations. Ł GeoTracker: A List that is maintained by Regional Water Quality Control Boards. Ł Local Counties and Cities maintain lists 
for hazardous substances cleanup sites and leaking underground storage tanks. Ł The United States Army Corps of Engineers, 911 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, 90017, (213) 452-3908, maintains a list of Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS). 2) The EIR should identify the mechanism to initiate any required investigation and/or remediation for any site within the proposed Project area that may be contaminated, and the government agency to provide appropriate regulatory oversight. If necessary, DTSC would require an oversight agreement in order to review such documents. Mr. Paul Weghorst February 8, 2011 Page 3 3) Any environmental investigations, sampling and/or remediation for a site should be conducted under a Workplan approved and overseen by a regulatory agency that has jurisdiction to oversee hazardous substance cleanup. The findings of any investigations, including any Phase lor II Environmental Site Assessment Investigations should be summarized in the document. All sampling results in which hazardous substances were found above regulatory standards should be clearly summarized in a table. All closure, certification or remediation approval reports by regUlatory agencies should be included in the EIR. 4) If buildings, other structures, asphalt or concrete-paved surface areas are being planned to be demolished, an investigation should also be conducted for the presence of other hazardous chemicals, mercury, and asbestos containing materials (ACMs). If other hazardous chemicals, lead-based paints (LPB) or products, mercury or ACMs are identified, proper precautions should be taken during demolition activities. Additionally, the contaminants should be remediated in compliance with California environmental regulations and pOlicies. 5) Future project construction may require soil excavation or filling in certain areas. Sampling may be required. If soil is contaminated, it must be properly disposed and not simply placed in another location onsite. Land Disposal Restrictions (LDRs) may be applicable to such soils. Also, if the project proposes to import soil to backfill the areas excavated, sampling should be conducted to ensure that the imported soil is free of contamination. 6) Human health and the environment of sensitive receptors should be protected during any construction or demolition activities. If necessary, a health risk assessment overseen and approved by the appropriate government agency should be conducted by a qualified health risk assessor to determine if there are, have been, or will be, any releases of hazardous materials that may pose a risk to human health or the environment. 7) If the site was used for agricultural, livestock or related activities, onsite soils and groundwater might contain pesticides, agricultural chemical, organic waste or other related residue. Proper investigation, and remedial actions, if necessary, should be conducted under the oversight of and approved by a government agency at the site prior to construction of the project. 8) If it is determined that hazardous wastes are, or will be, generated by the proposed operations, the wastes must be managed in accordance with the California Hazardous Waste Control Law (California Health and Safety Code, Division 20, Chapter 6.5) and the Hazardous Waste Control Regulations (California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 4.5). If it is determined that Mr. Paul Weghorst February 8, 2011 Page 4 hazardous wastes will be generated, the facility should also obtain a United States Environmental Protection Agency Identification Number by contacting (800) 618-6942. Certain hazardous waste treatment processes or hazardous materials, handling, storage or uses may require authorization from the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA). Information about the requirement for authorization can be obtained by contacting your local CUPA. 9) DTSC can provide cleanup oversight through an Environmental Oversight Agreement (EOA) for government agencies that are not responsible parties, or a Voluntary Cleanup Agreement (VCA) for private parties. For additional information on the EOA or VCA, please see www.dtsc.ca.gov/SiteCleanup/Brownfields. or contact Ms. Maryam TasnifAbbasi, DTSC's Voluntary Cleanup Coordinator, at (714) 484-5489.

Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the Baker Water Treatment Plant Project. The ·proposed project will include a new offsite pump station near Peters Canyon Reservoir; a new non-reclaimable waste pipeline (NRW) to convey NRW from Baker Water Treatment Plant (WTP) to IRWD's sanitary sewer; and may include new pipelines to convey treated water from Baker WTP to the South County Pump Station and Pipeline. The project would provide increased water supply reliability in southern Orange County by creating redundancy of treatment system capacity and distribution infrastructure for potable water. The proposed WTP will be located at 21082 Wisteria Lane in the City of Lake Forest, and the proposed Raw Water Pump Station will be located at 9737 Peters Canyon Road in the City of Orange. The nearest State Route to the project is SR-241. The Department of Transportation (Department) is a responsible agency on this project and we have the following comments: 1. A Traffic Management Plan (TMP) for construction vehicles should be submitted to Caltrans in order to minimize the impacts to State highway facilities, particUlarly Interstate 5. Coordination of this project with other construction activities on 1-5 and SR-241 may be needed. Any hauling of materials should not occur during A.M and P.M peak periods of travel on State facilities during demolition and construction of the proposed project. All vehicle loads should be covered so that materials do not blow over or onto the Department's Right-of-Way. Please continue to keep us informed of this project and any future developments, which could potentially impact the State Transportation Facilities. If you have any questions or need to contact us, please do not hesitate to call Marlon Regisford at (949) 724-2241.

ces Manager, Irvine Ranch Water District: 
  Paul, in lieu of a letter from the Regional Water Quality Control 
Board, you may wish to either 1) credit this email as part 
of the CEQA comment period (ending tomorrow) for the En
vironmental Impact Report for the above project (SCH# 
2010051055), or 2) simply accept this message.  
  To the existing Baker Filtration Plant (on Wisteria in Lake Forest), you propose addition of the Baker Treatment Plant.  

 About 28 MGD of raw water (sources: MWD import, Irvin
e Lake, etc.) will be treated by membrane, UV, and 
chloramination.  Emergency overflow may be needed occasion
ally through a pipe outlet constructed in an adjacent 
ravine.   Following my  consultation with our Permitting 
Section staff, including Chief Gary Stewart, we have the 

following concerns: 
  1) The pipe outlet may require "dredge and fill" activity wi
thin waters of the U.S., as generally acknowledged in the 
EIR.   Please consult with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
to see whether they will take jurisdiction pursuant to Clean 
Water Act Section 404; if so, please appl
y to this office for the prerequisite 
Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality 
Standards Certification.   The Regional Board may potent
ially issue Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs) for this 
construction if
 the Corps does not take jurisdiction.   Please advise our office either way. 
  
2) IRWD is enrolled in both NPDES permits for 
de minimus
 discharges applicable to Orange County, including that 
de minimus  general WDRs for discharges to the Upper Newport Ba
y watershed (Lake Forest).   Please ensure that the 
proposed chlorinated discharge does not exceed
 that permit's chlorine residual limit.   
  Thank you very much Paul

Water Treatment Plant
 
 
The South Coast Air
 
Quality Management District (
AQMD) appreciates the opportunity 
to comment on the above
-
mentioned document.  The following comments are meant as 
guidance for the Le
ad Agency and should be incorporated into the 
Final 
CEQA 
document
.
 
 
In the project descri
ption, the lead agency proposes construction at 
multiple sites. 
 
At the
 
Baker Water Treatment Plant (Baker WTP), 
the 
lead agency proposes the 
demolition of 
two small b
uildings
 
and 
a 
3.4 million gallon 
water 
reservoir.  
The Baker WTP would also 
include construction of the Raw Water Conveyance Facilities (including 1,100 linear feet 
of pipeline); Treatment Facilities; Treated Water Facilities; and Emergency Overflow 
Facil
ities.  The total amount of building debris would be approximately 10,000 cubic 
yards and the total building area would be about 26,250 square feet.  
Construction 
of
 
2,500 linear feet of sewer pipeline
 
along Serrano Creek Trail would also occur
.
  
Both the 
treated water 
pipeline and the
 
sewer pipeline 
construction would occur 
adjacent to 
residential areas.
  
At a second site, 
the Raw Water Pump Station, 
construction 
activities 
would include 
minor demolition, excavation and construction 
with a
n approximate one
-
acre construction footprint
.
 
 
In the 
Draft EIR
 
on page 2
-
17, the lead agency also cites compliance 
with the following 
AQMD Rules 201 and 203: 
Permit to Construct and Permit to Operate.  
Based on the 
project description, 
permit applications would be requir
ed for the 
proposed disinfection
 
facility, chemical storage, and 
standby generators.  In addition, permits may 
also 
be 
required for the stored chemicals: a
queous ammonia, ferric chloride, hydrochloric acid 
and citric acid.  
In addition to permits, t
he lead
 
agency should also 
include 
operational 
emission
 
estimates
 
from storage and 
use (disinfection) of the above chemicals along with 
the emissions from the 

20
-
50 hours per year from the standby 
generators.
  
These generators would be o
perated during regular maintenance even if the 
water plant is not used.
  
These emission estimates, along with any emission factors, 
methodologies used, equations, etc., should be included in the Final EIR.  
Questions 
regarding permits can be directed to AQ
MD staff at (909) 396

In addition to evaluating the above
-
mentioned air quality impacts, the 
AQMD 
recommends that 
the lead agency 
estimate
 
localized air quality impacts
 
to ensure that any 
nearby sensitive receptors 
are not adversely affected by the 
construction activities that are 
occurring in close proximity.
  
I
t is noted 
in Figure 2
-
2 and 
in an aerial map inspection
 
that
 
the proposed project is located within one
-
quarter mile of sensitive receptors 
(residential propert
y
) 
north
 
and west 
of the 
propo
sed Baker WT
P
 
proposed project
 
site
 
and north of the proposed Raw Water Pump Station
.  
AQMD guidance for performing a 
localized air quality analysis can be found 
on the AQMD web page.
1
 
 
Should the lead 
agency conclude after its analyses that construction 
o
r operational 
localized 
air quality 
impacts exceed the 
AQMD daily significance thresholds, staff has compiled mitigation 
measures 
that can be
 
implemented if the air quality impacts are determined to be 
significant.
 
2
 
  
 
 
Pursuant to Public Resources Code S
ection 21092.5, please provide the AQMD with 
written responses to all comments contained herein prior to the adoption of the Final 
Environmental Impact Report. 
 
The AQMD staff 
is available
 
to work with the Lead 
Agency to address these issues and any other 
air quality 
questions that may arise.

Hi  Mr. Paul Weghorst

I was hoping to submit these comments for the draft EIR at the Baker 

water treatment plant. I know this is last minute but I think I made 

the deadline
1)I want to make sure there is no noise that comes from the plant. 
What assurances do we have?

It is silent now at night. I like to sleep with my window open and 

not hear noise.

Will you be conducting sound tests before and after the plant is in?
2) what will happen if chemicals leak from the storage facility? How 
will our neighborhood be affected? What are you doing to protect us?
3) Can we please plant the upper part of the slope along Wisteria and 
put in a better looking fence? Something without barbed wire preferably.

Thanks Dave Alexander

  What is the name of the head 
geologist for the proposed project?  The seismic activity south of Lake Forest, whic
h is in a Seismic Zone
 4, is not included on any maps or geologic an
alysis in the document. 
 What are the locations of the abandoned oil fields located in Orange County? 
 Specify the term ﬁraw waterﬂ to whether or 
not it includes recycled or sewage water as a source of supply to the treatment plant. 
 If the proposed project is not treating sewage water, then why does the EIR state that there may be some odors associated with the proposed project? 
 Was a comment letter from the City of Lake Forest Public Works Department considered 
in the Draft EIR regarding missing 
pipelines in the project area?  Which seismic building standards will be applied to the design and construction of the 

proposed project, since the project would not require city building permits and would not 
have to comply with any permit requirements?

9.4 Comment Letter Responses 
Comment DTSC-1 
The comment states that the EIR should evaluate 
whether conditions in the Project area may pose 
a threat to human health or the environment. 
The comment lists databases associated with some 
of the regulatory agencies.  
Response DTSC-1 
As required by CEQA, a search of Cortese List databases (per Government Code 65962.5) was conducted for locations of hazardous materials site
s in the project area. As determined on page 
3.7-3, 3.7-10, and 3.7-11 of the Draft EIR, th
ere were no hazardous materials/hazardous waste 
sites within one-quarter mile of any of the project sites.  
Comment DTSC-2 
The comment states the EIR should identify the 
mechanism required to initiate any required 
investigation and/or remediation for any site 
within the proposed Project area that may be 
contaminated, and the government agency to
 provide appropriate regulatory oversight.  
Response DTSC-2 
If hazardous materials are discovered during project
 implementation, the appropriate regulatory 
agencies with jurisdiction over the materials w
ould be notified, and IRWD would comply with 
existing hazardous waste handling and disposal regulations. Comment DTSC-3 
The comment states that any environmental inves
tigations, sampling and remediation for the site 
should be conducted under a Wo
rkplan approved and overseen by a regulatory agency that has 
jurisdiction to oversee hazardous substance clea

Response DTSC-3 
As described on page 3.7-3 of the Draft EIR, 
a preliminary hazardous materials assessments for 
the Baker site and Raw Water Pump Station site
 have indicated the presence of lead-based paint 
and asbestos-containing materials (ACM) in existing structures to be demolished as a result of the 

proposed project (Panacea, Inc., 2010a, 2010b). As
 described on page 3.7-12 of the Draft EIR, 
IRWD would be required to comply with all fede
ral and state regulations pertaining to worker 
protection again exposure to such hazardous mate
rials, including Cal OSHA regulations. In 
addition, IRWD would be required to comply with
 all federal and state regulations pertaining to 
abatement or disposal of hazardous materials 
and wastes to protect public health and the 
environment. If necessary to protect worker health and safety, ACM would be removed prior to 

demolition of structures. No mitigation measures are necessary. 
IRWD would determine what, if any, additional in
vestigations or sampling are necessary prior to 
project construction to determine if any additiona
l hazardous materials are present at the project 
sites. IRWD would be required to comply with
 all federal and state regulations pertaining to 
abatement or disposal of hazardous materials 
and wastes to protect public health and the 
environment. IRWD would contact the appropriate
 regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over any 
and all hazardous substances and develop a Workplan if necessary. 
Comment DTSC-4 
The comment states that if buildings, structures,
 or other asphalt/concrete-paved surface areas are 
planned to be demolished, an investigation 
should be conducted for the presence of other 
hazardous chemicals, mercury, and asbestos cont
aining materials (ACMs). The comment requests 
that proper precautions take place during de
molition activities of any identified hazardous 
chemicals, lead-based paints (LPB) or produc
ts, mercury or ACMs identified, and the 
contaminants should be remediated in complianc
e with California environmental regulations and 
policies.  Response DTSC-4 
See Response DTSC-3. 
Comment DTSC-5 
The comment states that project construction ma
y require soil excavation or filling and thus 
sampling may be required. Contaminated soils
 must be properly disposed. Land Disposal 
Restrictions (LDRs) may be applicable to the 
soils. Any imported soils to be used for backfill 
should be sampled to ensure it is free of contamination. 
Response DTSC-5 
If contaminated soils are encountered during proj
ect construction, IRWD would be required to 
comply with the USEPA™s Land Disposal Restric
tions (LDR) Program before disposing of such 
soils in any landfill. The LDR Program ensures th
at toxic constituents present in hazardous waste 
are properly treated before hazardous waste is 
land disposed. IRWD would ensure that any 
contaminated soils are treated to the standards 
required by the LDR Program before being placed 
in a landfill. Any imported soils used for backf
ill for the proposed project would be engineered 
fill, with documented constituents and characteris
tics, to ensure it is free of contamination.

Comment DTSC-6 
The comment states that human health and the 
environment of sensitive receptors should be 
protected during construction or demolition at the site. The comment requests, if necessary, a 
health risk assessment overseen by the appropria
te government agency and conducted by a 
qualified health risk assessor to determine if an
y potential releases of hazardous materials may 
pose a health or environment risk. 
Response DTSC-6 
The Draft EIR determines on page 3.3-25 that sens
itive receptors would not be adversely affected 
during project construction due to toxic air contamin
ants. IRWD has determined that a health risk 
assessment is not required. All schools are more 
than one-quarter mile from the project sites 
(DEIR, page 3.7-10). An assessment of the risks to
 the public or environment associated with the 
routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous
 materials is assessed in the Draft EIR on pages 
3.7-11 through 3.7-13. Mitigation Measure HAZ-1 includes BMPs that the construction 
contractor would be required to implement to
 prevent the accidental release of hazardous 
materials during construction.  
Comment DTSC-7 
The comment states that soils and groundwater 
at the project site may contain pesticides, 
agricultural chemical, organic waste or other r
esidue if the site was previously used for 
agricultural activities. The comment requests pr
oper investigations and remedial actions 
conducted by a government agency before 
project construction, if necessary.  
Response DTSC-7 
If soils contaminated with agricultural chemical
s are discovered during project implementation, 
the appropriate regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over the materials would be notified, and 
IRWD would comply with existing hazardous w
aste handling and disposal regulations. The proposed project is not expected to affect groundwater. 
Comment DTSC-8 
The comment states that if hazardous wastes will be generated by the project, the wastes must be 

managed in accordance with the California Hazar
dous Waste Control Law (California Health and 
Safety Code, Division 20, Chapter 6.5) and the 
Hazardous Waste Control Regulations (California 
Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 4.5). 
If hazardous wastes will be generated, the facility 
should obtain a United States Environmental Protection Agency Identification Number. The 

comment states that authorization from the local 
Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) may 
be required for certain hazardous waste treatment
 processes or hazardous materials, handling, 
storage or uses, and suggests contacting the local CUPA. Response DTSC-8 
The applicability of the California Hazardous Wast
e Control Law to the project is acknowledged in the Draft EIR on page 3.7-6. The applicability 
of the Unified Program and identification of the 
Orange County Environmental Health Division as th
e local CUPA can be found in the Draft EIR 
on page 3.7-8. The proposed project would not generate hazardous wastes but would require 
handling, storage, and use of hazardous materi

Response OC Public Works-1 
IRWD does not own the property where the propo
sed Emergency Overflow Facility would be 
located. The owner is either the City of
 Lake Forest or the County of Orange. 
Comment OC Public Works-2 
The comment states the Draft EIR is unclear what would keep the 100 feet between the 
Emergency Overflow Facility and the low fl
ow channel of Serrano Creek from eroding in 
response to the possible 54 CFS emergency discharge that could last ﬁfor several hours,ﬂ as 

described on page 3.8-16. If rip rap is emplaced over this area, Figure 3.4-2 of the Draft EIR 

would need to be revised to delineate that as an impact.  
Response OC Public Works-2 
As part of the Emergency Overflow Facility (EOF) 
design, riprap is proposed to be placed at the 
outlet of the pipe to reduce the velocity of flow 
in the pipe to non-erosive velocities. The riprap 
would be placed within the trapezoidal footprint of the EOF that is depicted in Figure 3.4-2. 

Therefore, in the unlikely event that the EOF is
 utilized, there would be no significant increase in 
erosion that would occur between the EOF and th
e low flow channel of Serrano Creek as a result 
of the discharge. No additional riprap would 
be placed between the EOF and the low flow 
channel of Serrano Creek. Comment OC Public Works-3 
The comment requests the EIR address the potentia
l for downcutting between the end of the Emergency Overflow Facility™s footprint and th
e low-flow channel of Serrano Creek, and within 
Serrano Creek itself below that point. The comment
 states additional clear water discharges have 
the potential to further destabilize the channel, wh
ich is already subject to severe downcutting.  
Response OC Public Works-3 
The EOF is for emergency discharges only.  Controls will be incorporated into the project design 
to reduce the possibility of the EOF being used, su
ch as monitoring of water levels within the 
plant using SCADA; local and remote alarms at th
e forebay and chlorine contact basin that are 
activated prior to overflow levels being reach
ed; and automatic increases in pumping when high 
water levels are reached to prevent overflow from occuring
. Serrano Creek at the EOF discharge location has an estimated peak flow rate of approximately 3,700 cfs during a 100-year storm 

event, based on prorating the flow rate from th
e approved San Diego Creek Flood Control Master 
Plan for the tributary area to the discharge point.  The overflow discharge of 54 cfs is 

insignificant (less than 2%) compared
 to the creek flow during storm 
events and is not anticipated to adversely impact the on-going erosion or downcutting in the creek.  Any local erosion at the 

EOF outlet as a result of a release during an em
ergency situation will 
be repaired by IRWD. Comment OC Public Works-4 
The comment states the EIR must address who owns
 the low flow channel into which discharges 
would occur and whether the owner 
has consented to accepting them.

Response OC Public Works-4 
IRWD does not own the property where the proposed EOF would be located. The owner is either 
the City of Lake Forest or the County of Orange. IRWD will submit an encroachment permit 

application to both the City and the County. If a response is received, then acceptance and 
issuance of the encroachment permit would constitu
te the acceptance of the flow by the owner. If 
no response is received from either party, 
then IRWD will proceed with the project. Comment OC Public Works-5 
The comment states the EIR should discuss the chemical and pollutant characteristics of the 
emergency discharges from all potential sources and how they might impact Serrano Creek flows. 

The comment states that the EIR does not address 
whether the emergency overflow facility is an 
appropriate use for a water body with multiple be
neficial uses identified as impaired on the most 
recently approved Clean Water Act Secti
on 303(d) list for California (2006). Response OC Public Works-5 
In the unlikely event that the EOF is utilized, the emergency discharge would include raw water 
that overflows from the forebay and water from th
e chlorine contact basin. The project design 
would include dechlorination facilities and mon
itoring facilities downstream of all overflow points within the Baker WTP and upstream of th
e emergency discharge point. The dechlorination 
facilities would neutralize the chlorine in the em
ergency discharge water, and water quality would 
be monitored to confirm the dechlorination faciliti
es are effective. As a result, there would be no 
chemicals or pollutants released into Serrano Creek
. No beneficial uses would be affected, and no 
further impairment would be imposed on Serra
no Creek or other downstream water bodies in 
accordance with the Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list for California (2006). 
Comment OC Public Works-6 
The comment states that the preparation of a Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) may not 

itself mitigate the impacts of the potential pollutant discharge to Serrano Creek.   
Response OC Public Works-6 
As stated above in Response OC Public Works-
5, there would be no chemicals or pollutants 
released into Serrano Creek in the unlikely ev
ent that the EOF is utilized and emergency 
discharges occur. 
Comment OC Public Works-7 
The comment states that the project should plan for a combined storm water/emergency flow 
structural water quality treatment (or bio-treatment) best management practice (BMP) at the 

coordinated discharge location.  
Response OC Public Works-7 
As stated above in Response OC Public Works-
5, there would be no chemicals or pollutants 
released into Serrano Creek in the unlikely ev
ent that the EOF is utilized and emergency 
discharges occur. No beneficial uses would be 
affected by the proposed project, and no further 
impairment would be imposed on Serrano Cr
eek or other downstream water bodies. The 
emergency discharge associated with the EOF is
 fundamentally different than the storm drain

discharge that would be associated with the future residential development mentioned in the 
Biological Resources Assessment. Storm drains are associated with wet season and dry season 

runoff that occurs throughout the year. Su
ch discharges have different water quality characteristics than the EOF emergency discharges 
and, as such, differing potential to affect 
Serrano Creek. The proposed EOF will remain 
separate from any future storm drain facilities 
associated with the planned neighboring development. 

Comment Caltrans-1 
The comment states that a Traffi
c Management Plan (TMP) for construction vehicles should be 
submitted to Caltrans in order to minimize the im
pacts to State highway 
facilities. The comment suggests that hauling construction materials should not occur during peak travel times on State 

facilities and all vehicles loads should be covered.  
Response Caltrans-1 
According to the Transportation Management Pl
an Guidelines (Caltrans, 2009), a Transportation 
Management Plan (TMP) is required for roadway construction projects on the State Highway 

System in order to minimize additional conges
tion and delays on State highways due to work-
related activities. The 2009 Guidelines indicate 
that if a construction project causes individual traffic delays of 30 minutes or more above a 
motorist™s normal travel time, then it would 
constitute a significant impact. Construction of 
the proposed project would not require the 
presence of any work zones or lane closures on I-5 
or SR-241 and would have no direct impact to 
State highway facilities. IRWD does not anticipate that the proposed project would result in 
additional traffic delays of 30 minutes due to 
the potential presence of construction-related 
vehicles traveling on State roadways. Therefore,
 IRWD would not be required to prepare a TMP 
for the proposed project. IRWD, its contractors, and its equipment suppliers would comply with 
all jurisdictional requirements for transportation of construction vehicles and equipment. 

Comment RWQCB-1 
The comment requests that IRWD consult with 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) 
regarding their potential jurisdiction pursuant to
 Clean Water Action Section 404 due to the 
construction and operation of the Emergency Ove
rflow Facility. If Section 404 is applicable to 
the proposed project, the RWQCB requests that IRWD apply for the requisite corresponding 

Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Standa
rds Certification. If the Emergency Overflow 
Facility is not under the jurisdiction of the USAC
E, then the RWQCB may issue Waste Discharge 
Requirements (WDRs) for construction of the Emergency Overflow Facility.

from CDFG for any discharge structure 
and dissipation features that would be insta
lled within the creekbed. IRWD would be required to comply with all conditions associ
ated with the Section 401, Section 404, 
and/or CDFG SAA permits. Implementation of Mitigation Measures BIO-8 and BIO-9
 would reduce impacts to jurisdictional resources to a less than significant level.  
Mitigation Measures 
BIO-8: Construction activities within Serrano Creek shall be limited to dry season 
periods to avoid wet weather flow
 conditions in the creekbed.   
BIO-9: No activities shall occur within Serrano 
Creek until appropriate permits have 
been obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of

Response RWQCB-2 
The Draft EIR acknowledges on page 2-17 that the 
project may require an NPDES permit for the 
Emergency Overflow Facility (EOF). In the 
unlikely event that the EOF is utilized, the

the emergency discharge point. The dechlorinatio
n facilities would neutralize the chlorine in the 
emergency discharge water, and 
water quality would be monitored

that IRWD take the project through the City™s 
ﬁDesign Reviewﬂ process to ensure that the project design is compatible with the surrounding 
area.  
Response City-1 
As stated in the Draft EIR, the proposed Raw Wa
ter Pump Station would be built in place of the 
existing Intertie facility, which currently is
 visible from Santiago Canyon Road and Jamboree 
Road (page 3.1-9). The proposed Raw Water Pump
 Station would be designed to be similar in 
height, size, and color as other adjacent buildings onsite. Any disturbance to the hillside around 
the perimeter of the site would be restored af
ter construction. Therefore, the viewscape corridor 
from surrounding public vantage points would not be
 substantially altered, and as the Draft EIR 
concludes, the proposed project would not have a significant impact on viewscapes or visual 
character of the site (pages 3.1-9 and 3.1-10)
. No landscape plan is required. The specific 
materials and color palette for the Raw Water Pu
mp Station will be identified during the design

that the EIR address specific design features that 
will reduce noise to less than significant levels. The comment requests that Mitigation Measure
 NOISE-3 be modified to include a post-
construction operational noise survey at the Ra

Response City-2 
The three pumps at the proposed Raw Water Pump 
Station would be enclosed in a building that 
would be designed such that the facility would co

the Santiago Hills II residential development is 
built, then this neighboring residential sensitive 
receptor would be not be impacted because the 
operation of the Raw Water Pump Station would 
be in compliance with City noise ordinances at
 the property boundary. In response to the 
comment, the text of the Draft EIR and Mitig
ation Measures NOISE-3 has been modified as 
follows: Page 3.10-9: The nearest sensitive receptor to construction activities at the Raw Water Pump Station 
would be residences approximately 1,190 feet south
north
. Table 3.10-1 shows that the 
greatest noise levels are associated with excav
ation and finishing and would be 89 dBA at 
a distance of 50 feet. Accordingly, attenuated at 1,190 feet, these residences would 
experience noise levels of up to 61 dBA Leq during finishing and excavation, the loudest 

of construction activities that would occur. 
Page 3.10-10:
 The Raw Water Pump Station is being constr
ucted at the existing Intertie facility. The 
pumps at the proposed facility would be enclosed, and would be inaudible to the nearest 

sensitive receptor located approximately 1,190 feet to the south
north
. Nonetheless, the 
proposed pump station would be designed for no
ise attenuation such that the sound levels 
would be in compliance with the City of 
Orange Noise Ordinance (8.24.050 Exterior 
Noise Standards) at the property line. Im
plementation of Mitigation Measure NOISE-3 
would ensure that project operation does not exceed noise standards by requiring post-construction noise monitoring to confirm compliance with standards at the property 
boundary.
 Impacts would be considered less than significant. Page 3.10-11:

Comment AQMD-1 
The comment states the Final EIR should include emission estimates, emission factors, 
methodologies used and equations for the storage

hydrochloric acid and citric acid, in addition to 
estimates of emissions from the use of the standby 
generators.  Response AQMD-1 
The proposed chemicals; aqueous ammonia, ferric ch
loride, hydrochloric acid, and citric acid are 
not considered VOCs. Therefore there would be 
no operational emissions from storage and use. 
Furthermore chemicals would be housed in a 
building with secondary containment in case of a 
spill. Section 3.7 Hazards and Hazardous Materials 
of the Draft EIR explains each chemical and 
includes Mitigation Measure HAZ-1 for proper chemical storage. 
Regarding permitting, and generato
r emissions, Section 2.6 Project Approvals, on page 2-16 of

response to the comment, text of the Draft EI
R Impact 3.3-1 has been revised as follows: 
Page 3.3-23: The new treatment facilities will require di
esel-fueled emergency generators. Each 
generator would be required to obtain an

generators are estimated to run 20-50 hour
s per year. Emissions from a generator running 
a worst case 24 hours a day were estimated using URBEMIS 2007 (
Table 3.3-7). As shown in Table 3.3-7, operational emissions
 from the emergency generator would not 
exceed SCAQMD thresholds.

Response AQMD-3 
The comment is noted. As required by CEQA, th
e South Coast AQMD will receive a copy of the 
Final EIR, including all comment letters and wr
itten responses to all comments, ten (10) days 
prior to the certification of the Final EIR.  
Comment Falcon-1 
The comment states that the EIR should include notification of all existing or proposed aesthetic 

quality obstructions on the IRWD property. The comment includes photographs of the current 

scenic view from the commenter™s property.  
Response Falcon-1 
Scenic views are evaluated in Chapter 3.1, 
Aesthetics. The Draft EIR includes Mitigation 
Measure AES-1 (page 3.1-10) that requires prep
aration and implementation of a Landscape Plan 
that would include specifications for maintenan
ce of perimeter vegetation and replacement of 
onsite vegetation to mitigate impacts to scenic views of the Baker WTP. 
Comment Falcon-2 
The comment requests reasoning for site location, 
specifically the site elevation, whether IRWD 
owns the land, needed services provided by the 
land, and the placement of the pipeline. The comment suggests ensuring the IRWD is not leasi
ng the land by checking the trust deed of the site. The comment states that the City of Lake
 Forest Public Works Department has identified 
missing pipelines. Response Falcon-2 
The Baker site was chosen because IRWD already 
owns the land; there is an existing treatment 
plant onsite; there are existing water distribution pi
pelines to bring water to/from the site; and all 
the project objectives can be met using this s
ite. The primary project objective is to provide 
increased water supply reliability in southern Ora
nge County by creating redundancy of treatment 
system capacity for potable water. The prope
rty for the Baker WTP is owned by IRWD. The 
proposed project is not missing pipelines; IRWD 
is unaware of any comments pertaining to the 
same from the City of Lake Forest.

Comment Falcon-3 
The comment requests checks for plugged oil 
wells on and near the property. The comment 
requests the location of the four abandoned dry 
wells mentioned in the Draft EIR on page 3.7-2 
and the kind of wells. Are they located on land owned by IRWD? 
 Response Falcon-3 
The EIR analysis includes a search of the Cort
ese List as required by CEQA, for existing/known 
hazardous waste and substances sites (Chapter 3.7)
. The Cortese List includ
es records of leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs), 
hazardous materials releases, contaminated soils (including 
petroleum), superfund sites, etc. The Baker WTP pr
operty is not on any sites listed in the Cortese 
List database (page 3.7-10).  
The Draft EIR states on page 3.7-2 that there are 
four abandoned dry wells in the City of Lake 
Forest. The four wells are located between 0.1 an
d 0.8 miles southwest of the Baker site and are 
classified as dry holes, which are defined as explor
atory wells that were 
not completed and never 
produced oil or gas. The dry wells were plugge
d in compliance with Public Resources Code 
Section 3,000 et al. (Personal communication, Bill Winkler, DOGGR, March 25, 2011). There are 

no wells located within the boundaries of the proj
ect sites. The closest well is located on the corner of Palmwood and Wisteria. A map from the 
State Department of Conservation, Division of 
Oil, Gas, & Geothermal Research (DOGGR) is provi
ded at the end of this chapter to show the 
locations of the four dry wells (
Figure 9-1). Comment Falcon-4 
The comment requests monitoring gigahertz radiati
on transmission for health purposes, in case of 
immune system, dehydration, Epstein Barr virus, heart pacers, and more effects on nearby 

residents. The comment requests disclosure of
 emission frequencies. The comment requests 
whether additional space on the tower would be rented or leased for extra revenue. 
 Response Falcon-4 
The equipment on the antennae tower are consid
ered ﬁlow-power, non-licensed transmittersﬂ by 
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 
Low-power, non-licensed transmitters do not 
require a license from the FCC; however, such tr
ansmitters require authorization from the FCC 
prior to being marketed in the 
United States to ensure compliance 
with regulations in Part 15 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 
Low-power, non-licensed transmitters are used 
virtually everywhere, particularly in consumer products such as cordless phones, baby monitors, 

garage door openers, and wireless home security 
systems. Non-licensed transmitters operate on a 
variety of frequencies set by the FCC. The equi
pment on the antennae tower located at the Baker 
site operates at between 902 to 928 megahert
z and 5.725 to 5.850 giga
hertz. These operational emission frequencies are available for public u
se for purposes such as cordless phones. At this 
time, IRWD has no plan to lease space on the to
wer to outside parties.  The equipment on the tower will continue to operate as part of IRWD™s existing SCADA system regardless of the 
construction and operation of the proposed
 Baker Water Treatment Plant facilities.

 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 9-16 ESA /208671 
Final EIR 
April 2011 
Comment Falcon-5 
The comment requests that faults and fissures 
on and near the property are checked using the 
most recent U.S. Geological Survey maps. The 
comment requests that the seismic activity and 
map include San Juan Capistrano, and that the EI
R states the name of the 
earthquake fault in the vicinity of Lake Forest.
 Response Falcon-5 
Seismic hazards are addressed in the EIR in Chapte
r 3.6. The faults located in the project area, 
including the area south of Lake Forest, are show
n in Figure 3.6-1 in the Draft EIR. A description of the faults and most recent seismic activity al
ong the active faults are described on pages 3.6-3 
through 3.6-5 of the Draft EIR. 
Comment Falcon-6 
The comment requests a sufficient monitoring system
 to detect ammonia based leaking into water 
table. The comment states concerns of whether 
design or instrumentation planning exists for 
monitoring of leakage into water table.
 Response Falcon-6 
Project operation would have no 
affect on groundwater or groundwater quality. There would be 
no contact between chemicals and the ground surf
ace. All chemicals, including aqua ammonia, 
would be stored in tanks in an enclosed build
ing with secondary containment in the event of a 
spill. The secondary containment for each tank would 
be designed to hold the full tank volume in 
the event of an emergency to avoid chemical
 spills (Project Description, page 2-15).  
Comment Falcon-7 
The comment requests that holding tanks contai
ning water and ammonia based chemicals be built 
to the correct earthquake specifications. The co
mment requests that the project states what seismic building standards or codes will be used 
since no city building permits are required. The 
comment asks if IRWD will employ their own inspectors.  
Response Falcon-7 
As discussed on page 3.6-18, the proposed project
 would be required to comply with CCR Title 
24, the California Building Code (CBC), which in
cludes technical specifications and engineering design criteria for grading, foundations, retaining 
walls, and structures within zones of seismic 
activity. The provisions of the CBC apply to the co
nstruction, alteration, movement, replacement, 
and demolition of every building or structure or an
y appurtenances connected or attached to such 
buildings or structures throughout California (Dra
ft EIR, page 3.6-12). Incorporation of CBC seismic safety codes into the project design woul
d minimize any impacts to project facilities due 
to seismic events and ground shaking. During 
construction, IRWD woul
d retain construction inspectors, whom among other things, would ensure that facilities are built in accordance with 

seismic safety codes as designated on fina
l design drawings and specifications. 
Comment Falcon-8 
The comment references a comment about odor 
made during the scoping meeting (see Comment 
PM-5). The comment requests another site where odor would be comparable.

Response Falcon-8 
See Response PM-5 below.  Odors from other sites 
are not pertinent to this proposed project. The 
Draft EIR concludes that there would be no imp
acts associated with odors due to the proposed 
project (page 3.3-25). 
Comment Falcon-9 
The comment states concerns for potential signifi
cant hazards to the public due to routine truck transport of hazardous waste, and requests the number of route transport times expected in one 
year. 
Response Falcon-9 
Impact 3.7-1 in the Executive Summary Table on 
page ES-18 is discussed further on pages 3.7-11 
and 3.7-12 of the Draft EIR. The Impact 3.7-1 pertai
ns to routine transport, use, and disposal of 
hazardous materials (rather than hazardous wast
e) during project cons
truction and operation. Hazardous materials would be used during cons
truction of the proposed project for a limited 
period of time. Once the Baker WTP is operational,
 the frequency of chemical deliveries to the 
Baker site is provided in Table 2-1 on 
page 2-16 of the Project Description. 
Comment Alexander-1 
The comment asks what assurances 
there are that there will be no noises coming from the plant. 
The comment asks if there will be sound test conducted before and after the plant is constructed.  
Response Alexander-1 
The Baker WTP would be built in compliance with 
the noise standards established by the City of 
Lake Forest (Chapter 3.10, page 3-10-6). No
ise levels at the Baker WTP boundary with 
residential properties would not exceed noise levels 
established in the City™s noise ordinance for 
residential properties. The Draft EIR includes a commitment to conduct a noise study once 
construction is complete to verify the project is in compliance with the noise ordinance 

(Mitigation Measure NOISE-3, page 3.10-11). 
Comment Alexander-2 
The comment asks what will happen if chemicals 
leak from the storage facility; how would the 
neighborhood be affected. The comment asks what 
IRWD is doing to protect the neighborhood.  
Response Alexander-2 
All chemicals, including aqua ammonia, would be 
stored in tanks in an 
enclosed building with secondary containment in the event of a spill. 
The secondary containment for each tank would be 
designed to hold the full tank volume in the even
t of an emergency to avoid chemical spills (see 
Project Description, page 2-15). The surroundi
ng neighborhood would not be affected in the 
event of an accidental spill.  In addition, as described on page
 3.7-11 of the Draft EIR, the California Hazardous Materials 
Release Response Plans and Inventory Program re
quires facilities that store hazardous materials

onsite to prepare a Hazardous Materials Business 
Plan (HMBP) that includes an inventory of 
hazardous substances and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The HMBP is submitted to local 
health and fire departments. In the event of 
an accident, the release of hazardous materials must 
be immediately reported to local fire and emer
gency personnel and appropr
iate county and state 
agencies. IRWD would be required to prepare 
a HMBP and ERP for the Baker WTP. These Plans 
would determine the response protocol in the event 
of an accident in order to protect public health 
and the environment. 
Comment Alexander-3 
The comment requests that the upper part of the sl
ope along Wisteria get planted and that a better 
looking fence be installed, preferably not barbed wire.  
Response Alexander-3 
The fence along Wisteria would be replaced. 
The fence design and material are still under 
development. The project includes a commitmen
t to develop a Landscape Plan that includes specifications for perimeter vegetation to screen
 the Baker WTP and would also provide some 
screening of the fence (Mitigation Measure AES-1, page 3.1-10). Comment PM-1 
The comment requests the name of the h
ead geologist for the proposed project.
 Response PM-1 
The Geotechnical Report for the Baker WTP was prepared by GMU Geotechnical, Inc. in Rancho 
Santa Margarita, California as a subconsultant to RBF Consulting, which is the lead engineering 
design firm for the proposed project.  
Comment PM-2 
The comment states that the seismic activity south 
of Lake Forest, which is in a Seismic Zone 4, 
is not included on any maps or geologic analysis in the document. 
 Response PM-2 
The faults located in the project area, including th
e area south of Lake Forest, are shown in Figure 
3.6-1 in the Draft EIR. A description of the faults and most recent seismic activity along the

Comment PM-4 
The comment requests that the term ﬁraw waterﬂ
 be specified to whether or not it includes 
recycled or sewage water as a source of supply to the treatment plant.
 Response PM-4 
Raw water is a general term used to describe the source of supply to a treatment facility. If it is a 
wastewater treatment facility, the term ﬁraw waterﬂ could mean sewage. If it is a potable 

treatment facility, the term ﬁraw waterﬂ means untreated natural water (not sewage). For the 

proposed project, the term ﬁraw waterﬂ means unt
reated natural surface water or groundwater.   
Comment PM-5 
The comment asks, if the proposed project is not
 treating sewage water, then why does the EIR 
state that there may be some odors 
associated with the proposed project?
 Response PM-5 
As a requirement under CEQA, the EIR must address odor as it relates to the proposed project. 
On page 3.3-25, the Draft EIR acknowledges that the project is not associated with typical 

odorous land uses. The Draft EIR concludes that ther
e would be no impacts associated with odors 
due to the proposed project (page 3.3-25). 
Comment PM-6 
The comment asks if a comment letter from the C
ity of Lake Forest Public Works Department 
was considered in the Draft EIR regarding missing pipelines in the project area.
 Response PM-6 
IRWD has not received a comment letter from the Ci
ty of Lake Forest Department of Public 
Works.  
Comment PM-7 
The comment asks which seismic building sta
ndards will be applied to the design and 
construction of the proposed project, since the pr
oject would not require city building permits and 
would not have to comply with any permit requirements.

IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant Project Scoping Report 
 IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT  
BAKER WATER TREATMENT PLANT PROJECT 
Scoping Report 
 Introduction 
Irvine Ranch Water District (IRWD) is the Lead Agency
 for the proposed Baker Water Treatment Plant (WTP) 
Project (proposed project). The proposed project would be located at the site of the existing Baker Filtration Plant 
on Wisteria in Lake Forest. The Baker WTP would provide
 treated water to IRWD customers and to the following 
retail water agencies in southern Orange County: El To
ro Water District, Moulton Niguel Water District, Santa 
Margarita Water District, and Trabuco Canyon Water Dist
rict.  The proposed project will improve water supply 
reliability by increasing local treatment capability for mu
ltiple supply sources, including imported water and local 
surface water from Irvine Lake. The proposed project would create redundancy of treatment system capacity and 

distribution infrastructure for potable water (non-irrigation u
se) in the event of the facility outages at the Diemer 
Filtration Plant, Lower Feeder Pipeline or Allen-McCo
lloch Pipeline (AMP) due to routine maintenance or 
unforeseen emergencies. 
Notice of Preparation and Notice of Availability 

The Notice of Preparation (NOP) was prepared by Envi
ronmental Science Associates (ESA) pursuant to the 
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), to notify 
interested parties that IRWD will be preparing an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) to evaluate potentia
l environmental impacts of the Baker WTP Project (see 
Attachment 1). 

The NOP was mailed on May 19, 2010 to interested parti
es, including local, state, and federal agencies; news 
publications; and other gr
oups or individuals who had previously expressed interest in the project. A Notice of 
2 Completion (NOC) was also prepared by IRWD and sent to the State Clearinghouse (see Attachment 2). Copies 
of the NOP were made available for public review at local libraries (Orange County El Toro Branch Library and 

Orange Public Library) and at the IRWD website: http://www.irwd.com. 
 Scoping Period The 30-day project scoping period, which began with th
e distribution of the NOP on May 19, 2010, remained 
open through June 17, 2010. During the scoping period
, IRWD held a scoping meeting on May 26, 2010, 6:30 
p.m. at IRWD™s main building (15600 Sand Canyon Av
enue, Irvine, CA 92618). IRWD placed public notices of 
the scoping meeting in the Orange County Re
gister-Recorder newspaper on May 24, 2010. 
At the scoping meeting, IRWD staff and ESA consulta
nts gave a presentation on the IRWD™s proposed action 
(see Attachment 3). Following these presentations, meeting par
ticipants were invited to ta
lk to staff regarding any 
issues they have. Participant questions and comments were
 recorded on a whiteboard and videotape, and comment 
cards were also available for participants to fill out at th
e meeting or to send in at a later date. The sign-in sheet 
from the public scoping meeting can be found in Attachment 4. 

Comments During the scoping period, IRWD received nine comment 
letters on the proposed project via mail, e-mail or 
facsimile (see Attachment 5). IRWD also received 
verbal comments during the scoping meeting; multiple 
comments were recorded (see Attachment 6). 

The next formal opportunity for public comments will be 
associated with the release of the Draft Environmental 
Impact Report, expected to be ava
ilable for public review in Fall 2010.

 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 1 ESA / 208671 
Notice of Preparation 
May 2010 
 Irvine Ranch Water District (IRWD), as the 
Lead Agency pursuant to the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), is proposing 
to construct the Baker Water Treatment Plant 
(WTP) onsite at the existing Baker Filtration Plant in the City of Lake Forest. The proposed 
project would provide increased water supply relia
bility in southern Orange County by creating 
redundancy of treatment system capacity and dist
ribution infrastructure for potable water. The 
proposed Baker WTP would have a normal operating 
capacity of about 43.5 cubic feet per second 
(cfs), or 28 million gallons per day (mgd), of ra
w water. The Baker WTP would provide treated 
water to IRWD customers and to the following re
tail water agencies in southern Orange County: 
El Toro Water District (ETWD), Moulton Niguel Water District (MNWD), Santa Margarita 

Water District (SMWD), and Trabuco Canyon Wa
ter District (TCWD). These participating 
agencies, along with the Municipal Water Distri
ct of Orange County (MWDOC), are considered 
Responsible Agencies pursuant to CEQA. In addition to the Baker WTP facilities, the proposed 
project also would include a new offsite pump st
ation near Peters Canyon Reservoir; new non-
reclaimable waste (NRW) pipelines to convey 
NRW from the Baker WTP to IRWD™s sanitary 
sewer; and may include new pipelines to convey tr
eated water from the Baker WTP to the South 
County Pump Station and Pipeline.  
IRWD was established in 1961 as a California Wa
ter District pursuant to the California Water District Law (California Water Code, Division 13
). IRWD provides potable and recycled water, 
sewage collection and treatment, and urban runoff treatment to municipal and industrial (M&I), 

and agricultural customers within an 114,560-acr
e service area in Orange County, California. 
Currently, 60 percent of the water IRWD provi
des for its customers comes from local sources, 
including groundwater (produced from the groundw
ater basin managed by Orange County Water 
District), surface water, and reclaimed water. The remaining 40 percent of IRWD™s water supply 

is imported by the Metropolitan Water District 
of Southern California (Metropolitan or MWD) and purchased by IRWD through the MWDOC. MWD imports water through both the State 

Water Project (SWP) and the Colorado River aqueduct systems. 
In 2001, IRWD completed a consolidation with 
Los Alisos Water District (LAWD), which served 
portions of the City of Lake Forest. The existi
ng Baker Filtration Plant (BFP), located on Wisteria 
in Lake Forest, was one of the facilities owned 
and operated by LAWD that is now owned by 
IRWD. Currently, the BFP is operational, providi
ng filtered well water as a supplement to the 
Zone A recycled water system. The operation of existing facilities at the BFP would be 

discontinued after implementa
tion of the proposed project. 
For a number of years, water agencies in south Or
ange County have investigated alternatives for 
improving both water supply and water system 
reliability. South Orange County receives the 
majority of its potable water from MWDOC via MWD™s Diemer Filtration Plant and the 
IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant

Allen-McColloch Pipeline (AMP). In December 1999, the AMP ruptured causing significant 
reductions in MWD supplies to southern Orange 
County, demonstrating the dependence of this 
region on AMP operation. In 2006, a study was undertaken by the Santiago Aqueduct 

Commission (SAC) to determine the feasibility of
 constructing a new water treatment plant along the SAC-owned Baker Pipeline. The SAC is comp
rised of IRWD and the Responsible Agencies. 
The product water from such a facility would prov
ide an additional supply of treated water to 
southern Orange County, creating redundant treat
ment and distribution capacity to the Diemer 
Filtration Plant and AMP. The study identified th
e BFP site as the location for such a facility.  
The proposed Baker WTP is a regional project that is intended to: 
 Improve water reliability to areas of south Or
ange County by constructing local treatment 
capability for a variable supply source (imported water from MWD and local Irvine Lake 

water). 
 Provide a reliable, local potable water supply in the event of emergency conditions or 
scheduled maintenance of MWD™s delivery system (e.g., AMP, Lower Feeder, Diemer 

Filtration Plant). 
 Increase operational flexibility by creati
ng redundancy within the water conveyance 
system. 
Raw Water Supply and Conveyance 
The raw water sources for the proposed project include imported water supplied by MWD or 

local surface water from Irvine Lake. Both raw 
water sources would be conveyed using existing 
pipeline facilities, including the MWD Lower Feeder, MWD Santiago Lateral, SAC Baker Pipeline, and SAC Irvine Lake Pipeline. Importe
d raw water would enter the Santiago Lateral from the Lower Feeder upstream of the Diemer F
iltration Plant. Then, raw water would enter the 
Baker Pipeline from the Santiago Lateral at the OC-33 turnout (
Figure 1).  Raw water from Irvine Lake would be used for up to
 three months per year and in the event of an 
outage of the Lower Feeder, Santiago Lateral, Diemer
 Filtration Plant, or AMP. Irvine Lake is fed 
by Santiago Creek and water imported throug
h the Santiago Lateral. The lake captures 
approximately 7,000 acre-feet of local runoff pe
r year (RBF/Carollo, 2010). IRWD is a partial 
owner of the lake together with Serrano Water Di
strict. IRWD currently supplies untreated water 
from Irvine Lake to irrigation customers. To deliv
er water from Irvine Lake to the Baker Pipeline, 
a new pump station would be constructed at the 
existing Baker/Irvine Lake Pipeline Flow Control 
Facility near Peters Canyon Reservoir (
Figure 1). The pump station would transfer water from 
the Irvine Lake Pipeline to the Baker Pipeline. The pump station would be aboveground and 

would be designed with a similar aesthetic and 
architecture as the existing neighboring buildings onsite.  MWD Diemer

Baker WTP 
Raw water would be treated at the proposed Baker 
WTP, which would be located at the site of the 
existing BFP. The Baker WTP would have a nor
mal operating capacity of about 43.5 cfs (28 
mgd) of raw water. The treatment plant would 
utilize membrane filtration, ultraviolet (UV) 
disinfection, and chlorination for treatment (RBF/Carollo, 2010). The proposed layout for the 

WTP facilities is shown in Figure 2.  
The proposed project would require demolition of 
all existing aboveground facilities at the BFP, 
except for the office and storage buildings, the two steel-tank recycled water reservoirs and the 
radio tower. The following new facilities would be constructed at the proposed Baker WTP as shown in Figure 2: forebay, feed water pump station, b
ackwash wastewater treatment facilities, 
chemical storage building, treatment building 
to house membrane filters and UV disinfection 
facilities, chlorine contact basin, flow control 
facility, TCWD pump sta
tion, product water pump 
station, surge tank, emergency generators, a
nd electrical equipment. The aboveground Baker 
WTP facilities would be designed to be compa
tible with existing and planned neighboring 
residential development. Raw water would be de
livered to the Baker WTP via the existing Baker 
Pipeline. Approximately 1,000 feet of new 42-inch
 feed water pipeline would be required onsite 
at the proposed WTP to convey raw water from the Baker Pipeline, which bisects the existing 

BFP, to the proposed treatment facilities.  Approximately 0.4 million gallons (MG) per day 
of non-reclaimable wastewater (NRW) would 
be generated at the proposed Baker WTP and c
onveyed to the IRWD sanitary sewer through new 
sewer pipelines. NRW would be conveyed to IRWD™s Michelson Water Reclamation Plant for 

treatment. The proposed sewer pipeline alignment is shown in 
Figure 3. Treated Water Conveyance 
Treated water from the Baker WTP would flow 
by gravity to IRWD customers through its 
existing distribution system. Treated water w
ould be conveyed to ETWD, MNWD, SMWD, and 
TCWD through a new pipeline connection to either the AMP or South County Pipeline (SCP). 

The preferred method of delivering water to the 
partner agencies would be through an existing 
connection to the AMP on the Baker WTP property.
 IRWD is currently coordinating with MWD 
for use of the AMP. If the AMP alternative is 
unable to be implemented, then IRWD would 
construct a new pipeline connecting the Baker 
WTP to the SCP. IRWD is considering two 
pipeline alignments to connect to the SCP, shown as Option 1 and Option 2 in 
Figure 3.   The EIR will assess the physical changes to th
e environment that would likely result from 
construction and operation of the proposed proj
ect, including direct, indirect and cumulative 
impacts. Potential impacts of the proposed
 project are summarized below. The EIR will 
identifymitigation measures if necessary to mini
mize potentially significant impacts of the 
proposed project.

Aesthetics The existing aesthetic quality of the project area
 is dominated by residential land uses, public 
facilities, and open space. The EIR will evaluate 
the proposed project for impacts related to 
aesthetic resources, including scenic vistas and views. 
Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Construction of the proposed project would ge
nerate emissions from 
construction equipment 
exhaust, earth movement, construction worker
s™ commute, and material hauling. Project 
operation would generate emissions
 associated with electricity used to power the new Baker 
WTP. The EIR will evaluate the effects of cons
truction and operational activities on air quality 
and greenhouse gas emissions and 
will develop mitigation measures if necessary to reduce the 
level of impact. 
Biological Resources 
The proposed project would be constructed pr
imarily within the boundaries of previously 
developed or disturbed sites. Some pipeline altern
atives, if selected, could result in construction 
in open space areas. The EIR will evaluate the pot
ential for the proposed project to impact 
biological resources, such as sensitive species and critical habitats, and will evaluate the project™s 
consistency with the Orange County Natu
ral Community Conservation Plan/ Habitat 
Conservation Plan (NCCP/HCP), local ordinances,
 and state and federal regulations governing biological resources.  
Cultural Resources 
Although the project sites are located primarily in previously disturbed area, excavation below the 

top soil could uncover previously unknown archaeol
ogical or paleontological resources. Historic 
resources also may exist in the area. The EIR 
will assess the potential effects of the proposed 
project on cultural resources. Mitigation measur
es will be developed if necessary to reduce the 
level of impact where possible. 
Geology, Soils and Seismicity 
The proposed project is located in a seismically active region. The construction of project 

components could be subject to potential seismic 
hazards including ground shaking. In addition, 
construction activities could expose soils to storm 
water erosion. The EIR will evaluate geologic hazards in the region and will develop mitigation 
measures if necessary to reduce potential effects 
from the proposed project.  
Hazards and Hazardous Materials 
Excavation activities could uncover contaminated 
soils or hazardous substances that pose a substantial hazard to human health or the e
nvironment. The EIR will assess the potential for 
encountering such hazards at the project sites 
and will develop mitigation measures if necessary 
to ensure that any hazards encountered during construction would be handled in accordance with 
applicable regulations. Operation of the proposed
 Baker WTP would require transport, use, and 
IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant
 8 ESA / 208671

disposal of regulated materials typically used in potable water treatment systems. The EIR will 
assess the potential for the public or the environmen
t to be affected by accidental release of 
hazardous materials due to project operation and w
ill develop mitigation measures if necessary to 
minimize potential effects.  
Hydrology and Water Quality 
The proposed project could change the drainage pa
tterns at the project sites, which could affect 
the volume and quality of surface runoff that in 
turn could affect local surface water resources. 
Excavation and construction activities could affect
 storm water quality if sediment or spills run 
off the project construction site. The EIR will 
identify storm water quality protection measures 
required during construction activities such 
as sediment fencing and spill prevention and 
containment. The proposed project is not expected
 to affect groundwater recharge or the water 
table.  Land Use and Recreation 
The project sites are located in residential areas of
 Orange County in the City of Lake Forest and 
in an open space area in the City of Orange. 
The EIR will evaluate the compatibility of the 
proposed project with existing a
nd planned land uses as identified on the General Plan Land Use 
Maps for both cities.  
Noise 
Construction of the proposed project would generate
 noise that could affect nearby residences and 
other sensitive receptors in the vicinity of th
e project components. The EIR will evaluate the 
proximity of sensitive receptors to the project components and recommend mitigation measures if 

necessary to ensure that the pr
oposed project complies with local policies and ordinances to 
minimize noise impacts. 
Population and Housing 
/ Growth Inducement 
Implementation of the proposed project woul
d enhance reliability of the water supply for 
residents within IRWD™s service area and the 
service area for the partner agencies (ETWD, 
MNWD, SMWD, and TCWD). The proposed project 
would not build new housing or otherwise 
have a direct impact on population growth in the project area. The EIR will evaluate the potential 

for the proposed project to indirectly induce grow
th and result in secondary environmental effects 
associated with growth. 
Traffic and Transportation 
Construction of the proposed project would tempor
arily add additional truck trips to the local 
transportation corridors for purposes of materials 
delivery and construction worker commutes. 
Operation of the proposed project would require 
regular deliveries of regulated materials for use 
in the water treatment process at the proposed Ba
ker WTP. The EIR will evaluate the impact of 
the proposed project on traffic and circulation at
 the project site. The EIR will develop mitigation 
measures if necessary to minimize any potential effects.

Biological Resources Assessment 
November 2010 
IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant  Environmental Science Associates (ESA) prepared
 the following biological resource assessment 
based on a review of available background informat
ion and site visits on 
March 27, 2009 to the 
Irvine Ranch Water District Baker Regional Wate
r Treatment Plant and Peters Canyon Reservoir 
Pump Station, as well as a June 29, 2010 visit to
 the site of a proposed sewer pipeline in a 
recreational trail along Serrano Creek. All study ar
eas are located in Orange County, California 
(Figure 1). The following report presents our findings 
and conclusions regarding the proposed project sites™ potential for supporting significant biological resources and proposes mitigation 

measures that may be undertaken in order to protect those resources.  
1.0 Introduction and Purpose 
This report identifies the biological resources present at three locations planned for construction 
or reconstruction by the Irvine Ranch Water Dist
rict (IRWD). The proposed project calls for the 
construction of the Baker Regiona
l Water Treatment Plant (RWTP) on site at the existing Baker 
Filter Plant in the City of Lake Forest. In add
ition to the Baker RWTP, the proposed project also 
would include a new offsite pump station at Pete
rs Canyon Reservoir (Raw Water Pump Station), 
a meter exchange and pipeline replacement at
 OC-33, a new sewer pipeline to convey non-
reclaimable waste (NRW) from the Baker WTP to IRWD™s sanitary sewer system, and new 

pipelines to convey treated water from the Baker RWTP to the South County Pipeline. New 

facilities that would be constructed at the propo
sed Baker RWTP include an emergency overflow 
48-inch diameter pipeline that conveys overflow
 water from the forebay and disinfection facility 
to Serrano Creek. The locations of the project components are mapped on 
Figure 2. The purpose of this biological assessment is to 
document existing conditions of the project sites 
and to evaluate the potential for the project to have any direct or indirect impacts on sensitive 

habitats, wetland resources, or rare, threatened, 
or endangered (special-status) plant or wildlife 
species. 
2.0 Methods 
ESA conducted a review of available background 
information including the proposed project 
layout, aerial photographs, and local soils survey
. The databases search included the California 
Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) (CDFG, 2010), the California Native Plant Society 

Electronic Inventory (CNPS, 2010), and the U.S.
 Fish and Wildlife Service endangered species 
list (USFWS, 2010). The CNDDB provided a list and mapped locations of special-status plant 
and wildlife species that have been recorded
 in the vicinity of the project site (
Figures 3 and 4). 
ESA queried these sources for special-status species 
records in the Lake Forest U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute quadrangle and the eight surrounding quadrangles (Orange, Tustin, Black Star 

Canyon, Corona South, Santiago Peak, Canada G
obernadora, San Juan Capistrano, and Laguna 
Biological Resources Assessment 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant

Beach).  The potential for special-status species 
to occur on the project site was based on the 
proximity of the project to previously record
ed occurrences in the CNDDB, on-site vegetation 
and habitat quality, topography, elevation, soils
, surrounding land uses, habitat preferences, and 
geographic ranges of special-status plant and wildlife species known to occur in the region. 
ESA biologists conducted field reconnaissance on 
March 17, 2009 to document the existing 
conditions of the site in terms of habitat for plan
t and wildlife species, and the potential to support 
wetland and/or riparian habitats. An additiona
l field reconnaissance was conducted on June 29, 
along the Serrano Creek Trail where a proposed sewer pipeline was added to the project 

description. The assessment included an inventory of
 plants within and adjacent to the project™s 
area of disturbance; characterization of onsite and adjacent plant communities and determination 
of their suitability to support special-status plan
ts or animals; identification of jurisdictional 
resources (e.g., ﬁwaters of the U.S.ﬂ and state protected waters), protected trees, or vegetation that 

could potentially be impacted; and, the presence of any wildlife movement corridors. The 

reconnaissance level field surveys were conducted on
 foot throughout the project areas. Plant and 
wildlife species observed in the field were reco
rded. All wildlife species observed during field 
surveys by sight, call, tracks, nests, scat (fecal dr
oppings), remains, or other signs were recorded. 
Binoculars and field guides were used for identification as necessary. Lists of special-status plant 
and animal species that have been previously
 recorded in the region are presented in 
Table 1.   
3.0 Environmental Setting and Site Descriptions 
3.1 Regional Setting 
The proposed project is located in the Saddleback
 Valley region of Orange County, California. 
The climate in this region can be characterized
 as Mediterranean, with an average high and low 
temperature 75.4 
ûF and 49.4 ûF, respectively. Annual precipitation averages 12.86ﬂ, with 10.74ﬂ 
accumulating from November to March. Elevation in the project area ranges from approximately 

630 feet at the Treated Water Connection Point Option 1 to approximately 475 feet at Serrano 

Creek. The proposed project would provide increased
 water supply reliability in southern Orange 
County by creating redundancy of treatment system capacity and distribution infrastructure for 

potable water. The project area lies within the Newport Bay Wa
tershed, which drains approximately 152.02 
square miles of southern Orange County to th
e Pacific Ocean. Serrano Creek and other drainages 
in the project area are part of the San Diego 
Creek/Peters Canyon Wash subwatershed, which is 
the largest subwatershed in the Newport Bay 
watershed and collectively drains into the 
northeastern end of Upper Newport Bay. 
3.2 Local Setting 
Baker Treatment Plant 
As shown in Figure 2, the proposed Baker RW
TP would be constructed on the southernmost 
portion of a 98-acre parcel in the City of Lake For
est at the site of the existing Baker Filter Plant. The Baker Filter Plant includes the following existing facilities: various influent and effluent

pipelines, filter building, Well No. 1 reservoir, Z
one 2 West domestic water pump station, Zone B 
recycled water pump station, one 3.4 million ga
llon (MG) partially-bur
ied concrete potable 
reservoir, two 2.0 MG above-ground steel tank recycled water reservoirs, two 16 MG buried 
concrete potable reservoirs, and office/storage 
buildings (RBF, 2008). Currently, Well No. 1 is 
operational, providing supplemental water to the 
Zone A recycled water system. Water from Well 
No. 1 is filtered onsite before entering the recycled water system.  
The project site is largely vacant land and is lo
cated within Non-Reserve Lands in the Central 
Subarea of the Orange County Natural Communiti
es conservation Program (NCCP). A residential 
development is planned in the northern portion of
 the site along with a detention basin and a 3-
acre park in the southern corner of the site. 
Treated Water Pipeline Alternatives 
Two alternatives for the pipeline connecting the Ba
ker facility to the South County Pipeline were 
evaluated. The alternatives run in a northwesterly
 direction from the Baker plant, adjacent to a 
residential area, characterized by paved roads, ornamental landscaping, and varying amounts of 
native and non-native vegetation. Where they di
verge, alternative 1 crosses an open space area 
consisting of coastal sage scrub (CSS), while alte
rnative 2 continues within the landscaped edge 
of the residential area.  
OC-33 Pipeline Replacement 
As part of the overall project, IRWD is require
d by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California (MWD) to upsize a 10-ft. portion of the OC-33 pipeline from 40 inch pipe to 50 inch 

pipe. The pipeline is located in a previously 
disturbed area devoid of vegetation and ground 
disturbance from work activities will be limited to the length (10 ft.) of the pipeline being 

upsized. Work activities associated with the pipe
line replacement include 
excavating/trenching, 
soil stockpiling, backfilling, and re-grading.
  Raw Water Pump Station 
The site for the proposed Raw Water Pump Sta
tion is bordered by Jamboree Road to the east, 
Peters Canyon Reservoir to the west, willow ripa
rian woodland to the north, and coastal sage 
scrub vegetation to the south.  The existing Intertie
 facility is fenced in, mostly paved or barren 
ground that is void of vegetation, and includes existing structures. The proposed pump station 

would be located at Peters Canyon Reservoir in 
the City of Orange. The pump station would be 
aboveground, located near the existing AMP Flow C
ontrol facility, with a footprint of 50 by 50 
feet (2500 square feet). The pump station woul
d include four 250-horsepower pumps and one 
pressure relief valve housed in a new building. C
onstruction activities will be constrained within 
the boundaries of the existing facilities and previ
ously disturbed ground at the Peters Canyon 
Reservoir. 
Serrano Creek Trail Sewer Pipeline 
The proposed sewer pipeline would be construc
ted within an easement along the existing Serrano 
Creek Trail that extends along the northern boun
dary of Serrano Creek.  This portion of the 
Biological Resources Assessment 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant 
4 ESA / D208671 
Biological Resources Assessment 
November 2010 
Serrano Creek Trail is bordered to the north by r
esidential neighborhoods and is an actively used 
pedestrian trail. The portion of Serrano Creek
 where the emergency outflow is proposed is 
undisturbed and consists mostly of riparian w
oodland. Approximately 0.6 mgd of NRW would be 
generated at the proposed Baker WTP and conveye
d to the IRWD sanitary sewer system.  A new 
connection at the southeastern corner of the site
 will be necessary, as well as new pipeline in the 
trail along Serrano Creek. Thus, approximately 2,50
0 linear feet of new 15-inch sewer pipeline 
would be installed along the Serrano Creek Trail in 
the City of Lake Forest™s Serrano Creek Park 
to connect to an existing 15-inch sewer pipelin
e with adequate capacity. The proposed sewer 
pipeline alignment would be located within an 
existing 15-foot utility easement owned by IRWD. 
NRW would be conveyed to IRWD™s Los Alisos
 Water Reclamation Plant for treatment.  
Serrano Creek Emergency Overflow 
There are two free surface facilities planned at the 
Baker site: 1) forebay and 2) chlorine contact 
basin. Each of these facilities will be constructe
d as a concrete tank with
 an overflow. Under possible, yet infrequent conditions, the Baker W
TP may require discharge of raw water from the 
forebay, or filtered water from the chlorine cont
act basin. To handle the flow a 48-inch diameter 
reinforced concrete pipeline is planned. The pi
peline will enable water overflows to be conveyed 
to Serrano Creek, south of the Baker site. The fu
ture development at the Baker site will also require a new point of storm drain discharge 
to Serrano Creek. It is currently planned to 
coordinate the points of discharge
 to construct concrete or rip-rap as necessary to prevent erosion 
at the creek. In addition, IRWD is currently 
working with both the Ba
ker WTP and development teams related to permit issues for the discharge. 
  3.3 Plant Communities and Wildlife Habitats Plant communities are assemblages of plant species th
at occur together in the same area. They are 
defined by species composition and relative 
abundance. ESA mapped 
vegetation communities within and surrounding the project area (
Figure 5) according to the California Department of Fish 
and Game™s 
List of California Terrestrial Natural Communities 
(CDFG 2003).  Common plant 
names are taken from J.C. Hickman (1993). Provided
 below is a brief description of the existing 
plant communities and habitats found within the primary components of the proposed project.  
Baker Plant 
The Baker site consists of existing structures a
nd paved or ornamental landscaped areas.  There 
are several native plants including numerous coast live oak (
Quercus agrifolia) located throughout the existing facility site. There is one 
small area of approximately 4.2 acres that can be 
considered a natural community and is best d
escribed as disturbed coastal sage scrub (CSS) it 
contains a mix of native and introduced species including; buckwheat (
Eriogonum fasiculatum
), coast goldenbush (
Encelia californica), black sage (
Salvia melifera), mulefat (
Baccharis salicifolia), elderberry (
Sambucus mexicana
) black mustard (
Brassica nigra), brome grasses 
(Bromus sp.), and wild oat (
Avena fatua).

Treated Water Pipeline Alternatives 
Two alternatives were evaluated for constructi
on of the connecting pipeline. Initially the 
alternatives follow the same path, northwest fro
m the Baker facility through landscape vegetation 
bordering a residential complex. At approximately 
halfway along the route, alternative 2 turns to 
the west continuing through the landscaped vegetation while alternative 1 continues northwest and crosses approximately 1400 feet of disturbe
d CSS. Species observed in this area include 
buckwheat, black sage, coast goldenbush, and elderb
erry. There is also an area within the CSS as 
that contains a small area of coastal prickly pear succulent scrub (
Opuntia littoralis
), which is also somewhat disturbed from existing trails and recreational use.   
Raw Water Pump Station 
Construction on this site will be 
contained within a fenced, previously graded and or paved area 
currently containing existing IRWD facilities. 
The surrounding area consists of native habitat 
with varying degrees of disturbance. These habitats
 include CSS (adjacent to the project site) and a willow riparian area down slope near the lake (approximately 300 feet away).  Species observed 

in this area include mulefat, coyote bush (
Baccharis pilularis), California sagebrush (Artemisia 
californica), buckwheat, black sage, coast goldenbush, and elderberry. Within the fence line of 
the existing facilities there are several mature
 trees including Brazilian pepper and eucalyptus, 
ornamental landscaping, and some CSS plants
 (i.e., mostly California buckwheat).   Serrano Creek Trail Sewer Pipeline
 Construction of the proposed pipelines would occur through trench installation. The sewer 
pipeline would be installed within an existi
ng 15-foot-wide utility easement that runs along 
Serrano Creek Trail. An additional 15-foot-wide temporary constr
uction easement adjacent to and north of the utility easement may also be utilized
. If necessary to construct, the treated water 
pipeline would be installed through approximate
ly 1100 feet of disturbed coastal sage scrub 
located to the east of the Baker site. The area cons
ists of a 20-ft.-wide compacted dirt pedestrian 
path that is bordered to the north with la
ndscaped, manufactured slope with mature sycamore 
(Platanus racemosa
) and ornamental ground cover. The natural community on the south side of 
the trail consists of a mix of native and nonna
tive ruderal vegetation, including black mustard 
(Brassica nigra), mule fat (
Baccharis salicifolia), calabazilla (Cucurbita foetidissima
), Toyon 
(Heteromeles arbutifolia
), coyote bush, buckwheat, Peruvian pepper (
Schinus molle), tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca
), shortpod mustard (
Hirschfeldia incana),  Russian thistle (
Salsola kali
), storksbill filaree (Erodium sp.), common reed (
Phragmites australis), Canary Island palm 
(Phoenix canariensis), fennel (foeniculum vulgare), prickly pear (Opuntia sp.), bull thistle 
(Cirsium vulgare), telegraph weed (Heterotheca grandiflora), sea fig (Carpobrotus chilensis
), and horehound (
Marrubium vulgare
). Stands of elderberry and two immature coast live oak trees 
are also located outside of the easement al
ong the south side of the trail.     
Emergency Overflow into Serrano Creek
 The portion of Serrano Creek where a proposed emergency overflow may occur is an 
approximately 0.5-mile stretch of the perennial/in
termittent stream south of
 the Baker site. This 
Biological Resources Assessment 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant

Biological Resources Assessment 
November 2010 
portion of Serrano Creek is characterized as Southern Sycamore Alder Riparian Woodland, a 
California Department of Fish and Game Sensitive Plant Community, with a dominant overestory 

of arroyo willow (
Salix lasiolepis
), sycamore (
Platanus racemosa
), and blue elderberry 
(Sambucus Mexicana
). Other overstory species include red willow (Salix laevigata
), poplar 
(poplar sp.), coast live oak (
Quercus agrifolia), and eucalyptus. Common understory species 
include mule fat, Toyon (
Heteromeles arbutifolia
), common reed, and coyote bush. Wildlife 
species observed within and in the vicinity 
of Serrano Creek include American goldfinch 
(Carduelis tristis), house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus
), common raven (Corvus corax), and spotted towhee (
Pipilo maculatus). Although no raptors or nests were observed during a 
reconnaissance-level assessment, some of the sy
camore and larger eucalyptus trees within the 
riparian area could potentially pr
ovide raptor nesting habitat. 
4.0 Special-Status Biological Resources 
Plant and animal species are accorded special st
atus because of their recognized rarity or 
vulnerability to various causes of habitat loss or
 population decline. Some of these receive 
specific protection defined in federal or state e
ndangered species legislation. Others have been 
designated as ﬁsensitiveﬂ or special status on the b
asis of adopted policies and expertise of state 
resource agencies or organizations with acknowle
dged expertise, or policies adopted by local 
governmental agencies such as counties, cities, a
nd special districts to meet local conservation 
objectives. The California Department of Fish and Game has also designated certain natural 
communities special status, due to their rarity.

4.1 Special-Status Botanical Resources 
A CNDDB search (CDFG, 2010) revealed the reco
rded occurrences of 13 special status plant species within a five mile radius project area. These species are listed above in 
Table 1
 and their 
locations are noted on Figures 3 and 4. Three of the rare plant species found to have nearby 

records of occurrence are listed as endangered or th
reatened by either the State of California or 
the federal government, thread-leaved brodiaea, (Brodiaea filifolia
), San Fernando Valley 
spineflower (Chorizanthe parryi var. fernandina
), and Santa Ana River woollystar (Eriastrum 
densifolium ssp. Sanctorum
).  Habitat for any of these three speci
es is not found on the project 
sites and none of the three is likely to be found on the project sites. Ten other species listed in 

Table 1 and designated as rare by the California Na
tive Plant Society (CNPS 2001), have nearby 
records of occurrence, none of those has a high probability of occurrence on any of the project 
sites.  
4.2 Special-Status Wildlife Resources 
The CNDDB (CDFG, 2010) search revealed the recorded occurrences of 26 special-status wildlife species in the area that may have the poten
tial to occur on the project sites. These species 
have nearby records documented 
in the CNDDB however habitat these species is very limited at 
the Baker Plant siteand the adjacent pipeline altern
atives. At Peters Canyon Reservoir habitat for 
special status species is not found within the fe
nced area planned for construction although there 
is habitat adjacent to the site particularly around the perimeter of the reservoir.  
4.3 Special-Status Natural Communities 
The area of Serrano Creek where an emergency overfl
ow area is to be located is characterized as 
Southern Sycamore Alder Riparian Woodland; 
a CDFG-listed sensitive terrestrial community.  
No natural communities of special concern as desi
gnated by the California Department of Fish 
and Game were recorded in the CNDDB within 
the areas of the proposed project site and no natural communities of special concern were observed on the project sites.  The plant community 
is found near by the proposed pipeline route woul
d result in temporary construction along already 
existing roads and right-of-ways, and would not further restrict wildlife movement. Construction 

on the proposed project sites would not fragment any portion of the open space habitat, nor 

inhibit wildlife movement. Project alternative site 
3 is located at the edge an already fragmented 
and developed area and does not constitute a significant wildlife corridor. Impacts to wildlife 

movement from construction on any of the proj
ect alternative sites would not be expected. 
4.4 Wildlife Movement Corridors 
Construction of new facilities at the Baker Filtr
ation Plant and the proposed Raw Water Pump 
Station will be within the boundaries of a previ
ously developed site. Construction on the site 
would not interfere with local or regional w
ildlife movement. Moreover, the pipeline options 
occur near the edge of a small patch of coastal sage scrub habitat, which does not represent a 
wildlife movement corridor due to surrounding urbanization that cuts off movement to open 

space lands in the region.  Nonetheless, some anim
als adapted to urban conditions are expected to 
traverse through Serrano Creek from the north, whic
h may include coyote, skunk, opossum, and 
Biological Resources Assessment 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant

raccoon.  However, passage through Serrano Creek 
to the south is terminated at Bake Parkway 
urban development.  Based on aer
ial photographs and review of the USGS Quadrangle for Lake 
Forest, Serrano Creek runs underground at Bake 
Parkway and does not resurface downstream.  
To the north, Serrano Creek bisects urban deve
lopment and traverses underneath Highway 241, 
extending further north to Whiting Ranch and Sa
ntiago Canyon which makes up the headwaters 
of the creek.  In summary, animals are not expect
ed to traverse through the proposed project site 
and the project site is not considered a wild
life migration corridor. Therefore, construction 
activities associated with the pipeline alignmen
ts would not impact any wildlife movement 
corridors. 4.5 Habitat Conservation Plans and Local Ordinances 
The Orange County Natural Community Conservation Plan/Habitat Conservation Plan. 

(NCCP/HCP) sets forth a proposed Conservation St
rategy that would be implemented by the 
County of Orange in cooperation with state and fe
deral agencies and Participating Landowners in 
Orange County. The proposed Conservation St
rategy focuses on long-term protection and 
management of multiple natural communities that 
provide habitat essential to the survival of a broad array of wildlife and plant species.   
The Baker RWTP, treated water pipelines and sewer pipelines would be constructed in areas 
designated as Non-Reserve Lands in the NCCP
/HCP.  Construction at the Baker RWTP and 
pipelines will not be in conflict with the NCCP/HCP.  
Although the proposed Raw Water Pump Station 
is located within Reserve Lands of the 
NCCP/HCP, demolition of existing structures and c
onstruction of new facilities at the proposed 
Raw Water Pump Station will occur entirely within
 the (disturbed) boundaries of the existing site. 
The site does not support any habitat capable of
 supporting any candidate, sensitive or special-status species, therefore construction at the pr
oposed Raw Water Pump Station will not be in 
conflict with the Orange County NCCP/HCP 
Twelve oak trees and several eucalyptus trees occur 
within the Baker Filtration Plant Facility and 
may be impacted during the demolition of the 
existing facilities or the construction of new 
facilities.  The City of Lake Forest does not have
 tree ordinances for protecting trees; therefore, a permit is not required for the removal of trees.  However, a Eucalyptus Tree Cutting Permit must 

be obtained prior to cutting, pruning or removing any eucalyptus trees.  The city™s eucalyptus 

trees currently are threatened by the activity 
of the Eucalyptus Longhorn Borer Beetle, which 
causes serious damage and destruction during the pe
riod of April 1 through October 31.  The city 
has established a ﬁrestrictive periodﬂ for which no 
eucalyptus trees can be 
cut, pruned or removed 
during this time.   
According to the Recreation and Resource Elemen
t of the City™s General Plan, development 
proposals will be reviewed for potential biological resource impacts according to CEQA and 

applicable state and federal wildlife regulation. Where significant impacts are identified, the City 
will require modifications to the project to avoid the impact, or require mitigation measures to 

reduce the impact. The focus of the impact
 assessment included the following resources:
 Biological Resources Assessment 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant 
13 ESA / D208671

November 2010 
 Riparian and wetland habitat;   Coastal sage scrub habitat;  
 Rare and endangered plant and animal species;  
 Wildlife movement corridors;  
 Habitat fragmentation; and  
 Significant tree stands. 
 Riparian and wetland habitats, rare and endangered plant 
and animal species, wildlife 
fragmentation, and impacts to CSS have been prev
iously discussed.  The Project is located within 
and surrounded by urban development; therefore,
 it is already fragmented from open lands and 
habitats that occur to the east of the city™s limits
. Moreover, there are no significant tree stands in 
or near the project boundary.
  4.6 Jurisdictional Resources 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
Wetlands and other waters, e.g., rivers, streams and natural ponds, are a subset of ﬁwaters of the 
U.S.ﬂ and receive protection under Section 404 of
 the Clean Water Act (CWA). The U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers (USACE) has primary federal 
responsibility for administering regulations that 
concern waters and wetlands on the project 
site under statutory authority of the CWA 
(Section 404). In addition, the regulations and policies of various federal agencies (e.g., U.S. 

Department of Agriculture, and Natural R
esource Conservation Service [NRCS], USEPA) 
mandate that the filling of wetlands be avoided to the extent feasible. The USACE requires 

obtaining a permit if a project proposes placing structures within navigable waters and/or 

alteration of waters of the United States. 
The term ﬁwaters of the United Statesﬂ as 
defined in Code of Federal Regulations (33 CFR 328.3[a] and [b]; 40 CFR 230.3[s]) include
s those areas that are inundated or saturated 
by surface or ground water at a frequency and 
duration sufficient to support, and that under 
normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated 

soil conditions. In extant regulations, these may be 
taken to be sloughs, wet meadows, or natural 
ponds; however, the Supreme Court of the United 
States recently ruled (January 8, 2001: 
Solid 
Waste Agency of Northwestern Cook County (SWANCC) v. United State Army Corps of Engineers et al.) that certain isolated wetlands do not fall under the jurisdiction of the CWA. 
Based on the Supreme Court ruling (SWANCC), non-nav
igable, isolated, intrastate waters are no 
longer defined as waters of the United States. Ju
risdiction of non-navigable,
 isolated, intrastate 
waters may be possible if their use, degradation, 
or destruction could affe
ct other waters of the 
Unites States, or interstate or 
foreign commerce. Jurisdiction over su
ch other waters is analyzed on 
a case-by-case basis. Impoundment
s of waters, tributaries of wate
rs, and wetlands adjacent to 
waters should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. 
A more recent Supreme Court case, 
Rapanos v. United States 
(2006), also questioned the definition 
of ﬁwaters of the United Statesﬂ and the scope of federal regulatory jurisdiction over such waters, 

but left open the question as to whether the CWA ex
tends to those waters and wetlands that have a 
Biological Resources Assessment 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant 
14 ESA / D208671 
Biological Resources Assessment 
November 2010 
ﬁsignificant nexusﬂ to navigable wate
rs of the United States, or whether it is limited to waters with a 
continuous connection. The implica
tions of this ruling are still be
ing tested in the courts. For 
example, the California Ninth Circu
it Court of Appeals decision, in 
Northern California River 
Watch v. City of Healdsburg
 (August 10, 2006), relied on the ﬁs
ignificant nexusﬂ definition, an 
interpretation that suggests little change in the 
scope of the CWA. To date, neither the USEPA nor 
the USACE have issued guidelines as to how to im
plement the CWA in light of these latest rulings. 
In practice, USACE jurisdictional au
thority remains as it was prior to 
Rapanos, although the 
potential exists for changes in the future based 
on Court decisions and pending regulatory guidance. 
California Department of Fish and Game 
Under Sections 1600 Œ 1616 of the California Fish and Game Code, the CDFG regulates activities 
that would substantially divert, obstruct the natu
ral flow, or substantially change of rivers, 
streams and lakes. The jurisdictional limits of CDFG are defined in Section 1602 of the California 
Fish and Game Code as, ﬁbed, channel, or bank of
 any river, stream, or lake, or deposit or dispose 
of debris, waste, or other material containing crumbled, flaked, or ground pavement where it may 
pass into any river, stream, or lake–.ﬂ The 
CDFG requires a Lake and Streambed Alteration 
Agreement for activities within its jurisdictional 
area. Impacts to the jurisdictional area of the 
CDFG would be considered ﬁsignificantﬂ in this EIR. 
5.0 Analysis and Conclusions 
5.1 Impacts 
The proposed project is not likely to have ne
gative impacts on special-status species. The 
previously disturbed nature of the sites contai
ning existing facilities and the disturbance level and 
proximity to residences of the pipeline alterna
tives greatly reduce the likelihood that special 
status species would be encountered. Neverthe
less, some precautionary mitigation measures 
outlined below in Section 5.2 are suggested in or
der to ensure impacts of less than significant 
level per CEQA Guidelines.  The proposed construction activities at the Baker 
Filtration Plant and the proposed Raw Water Pump Station will be within the boundaries of a pr
eviously developed site; therefore, no habitats 
are present to support potentially occurring special-status species. As depicted on 
Figure 2, the 
proposed Pipeline Option 1 would extend for approximately 1400 feet through coastal sage scrub 

(CSS), a plant community with the potential to 
support several special-status species. The 
proposed Pipeline Option 2 is confined to landscap
ed areas adjacent to residential development, 
and would not directly impact CSS habitat. Th
e CSS habitat located adjacent to the proposed pipeline alignments is relatively disturbed by sev
eral dirt paths actively used for off-road bicycles 
and hikers (several bikers and hikers were observed within these coastal sage scrub habitats 
during the biological assessment conducted by ESA).
 In addition, the CSS habitat is located 
immediately adjacent to a high density residen
tial development. Nearby occurrence records 
(CNDDB 2009) for special-status species known to 
occur within CSS plant community include 
coastal California gnatcatcher (
Polioptila californica californica
), a federally-listed threatened 
species, and the following Species of Speci
al Concern: coastal cactus wren (
Campylorhynchus Biological Resources Assessment 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant 
15 ESA / D208671 
Biological Resources Assessment 
November 2010 
brunneicapillus sandiegensis
), orange throated whiptail (
Aspidoscelis hyperythrya
), coast patch-nosed snake (Salvadora hexalepis
), and coast (San Diego) horned lizard (
Phrynosoma coronatum 
coronatum)..   
Approximately 0.7 acres of CSS would be impacted from the proposed Pipeline Option 1 
alignment. Due the disturbed condition of the 
CSS and its proximity to adjacent residences, 
coastal California gnatcatchers are not expected 
to occur. However, the sensitive terrestrial 
species listed above could be present. Impacts to CSS would be avoided by the proposed Pipeline 

Option 2 alignment. No special-status species w
ould occur within the landscaped areas located 
adjacent along the Option 2 alignment 
One raptor nest was observed within the blue gum (
Eucalyptus globulus
) trees located at the western boundary of the Baker Filtration Plant fac
ility. Other birds, including song birds, jays and 
raptors are expected to nest within the trees 
and shrubs located throughout the Plant facility, as 
well as within the vegetation within and adjacen
t to the proposed Raw Water Pump Station and 
pipeline alignments.  Mitigation measures to redu
ce impacts to breeding and nesting birds to a 
level of less than significant are provided below. 
The area of the proposed sewer line extension alon
g Serrano Creek Trail is previously disturbed, 
as the pipeline will be trenched along the trail with a small construction buffer on either side of 
the trail. Any disturbance to large trees on the south 
side of the trail located within or adjacent to 
Serrano Creek t would be minimal, especially if tr
imming and/or cutting can be avoided. Potential 
raptor-nesting habitat occurs in some of the larger
 eucalyptus trees within 50 feet of the trail and 
in Serrano Creek. Although no raptor nests were
 observed during field surveys, mitigation 
measures to reduce impacts to breeding and nesti
ng birds to a level of less than significant are suggested.  5.2 Recommended Mitigation Measures 
General Measures for Preservation of Biological Resources  
In order to mitigate impacts relative to special stat
us species to a level of less than significant, the 
project applicant should require construction c
ontractors to implement the following measures
:  A City-approved biologist should be retained
 by the applicant as a construction monitor 
to ensure that incidental construction impacts on retained biological resources are 
avoided or minimized. Responsibilities of th
e construction monitor should include the 
following: 
Œ Attend all pre-grading meetings to ensure 
that the timing and location of construction 
activities do not conflict with mitigation requirements. 
Œ Conduct meetings with the contractor
 and other key construction personnel, 
describing the importance of restricting work to within the project boundaries and 

outside of the preserved areas. The monitor should also discuss staging/storage areas 
for construction equipment and materials. 
The biological monitor should investigate 
all on site storage areas to minimize impacts to biological resources. 
Biological Resources Assessment 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant 
16 ESA / D208671 
Biological Resources Assessment 
November 2010 
Œ Guide the contractor in marking/flaggi
ng the construction area, in accordance with 
the final approved construction plan. Any construction activity areas immediately 
adjacent to special-status plant populations
 or other special-status resources may be 
directed to be flagged or temporarily fenced at the discretion of the monitor. 
Œ Periodically and routinely visit the site dur
ing construction to c
oordinate and monitor 
compliance with the above provisions. 
Œ Construction personnel should
 be prohibited from entry into native areas outside the 
designated construction area, except for necessary construction related activities, 
such as surveying. All such construction ac
tivities in or adjacent to remaining open 
space areas should be coordinated with the project biologist. 
 Exclusionary fencing (i.e., silt fencing) s
hould be installed around the perimeter of all 
areas where native vegetation is present adj
acent to work areas.  The exclusionary fencing should be backfilled (or buried) at th
e base of the fence to exclude reptiles from 
entering the work area.  Installation of excl
usionary fencing should be verified by a 
qualified biologist prior to the commencem
ent of construction or ground disturbing 
activities. 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
The federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 USC, 
Section 703, Supp. I, 1989) prohibits killing, 
possessing, or trading migratory birds, except in
 accordance with regulations prescribed by the 
Secretary of the Interior. Migratory birds protected
 under this law include most native birds, with 
the exception of a few old wo
rd species, such as wrentit (
Chamaea fasciata), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris
) rock pigeon (
Columba livia), house sparrow (
Passer domesticus
) and certain 
game birds (e.g. turkeys and pheasants). This act
 encompasses whole birds, parts of birds, and 
bird nests and eggs. Migratory birds are also pr
otected by the state of California, under Section 
3513 of the California Fish and Game Code (DFG Code). The DFG Code also protects all 

breeding birds under Section 3503, and raptors (eag
les, hawks, and owls) under Section 3503.5.  
 To avoid impacts to native nesting birds, in
cluding cactus wren, the applicant and/or its contractors should retain a qualified biologist 
to conduct nest surveys in potential nesting 
habitat within and adjacent to the Project Site
 prior to construction or site preparation 
activities. Specifically, within 30 days of 
ground disturbance activities associated with 
construction or grading, a qualified biologist
 should conduct weekly surveys to determine 
if active nests of bird species protected by th
e Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) or the 
DFG Code are present in the construction zone 
or within a distance determined by CDFG 
or the qualified biologist. Because many birds 
expected to use the project area nest during 
the late winter (such as Anna™s hummingbird [
Calypte anna] and Cooper™s hawk 
[Accipiter cooperii
]), breeding bird surveys should be carried out both during the typical 
nesting/breeding season (mid March through September) and in January and February. 
The surveys should continue on a weekly basis,
 with the last survey being conducted no 
more than five days prior to initiation of
 clearance or construction work. If ground 
disturbance activities are delayed, additional 
pre-construction surveys will be conducted 
such that no more than five days will have
 elapsed between the last survey and the 
commencement of ground disturbance activities.
 Surveys should include examination of 
Biological Resources Assessment 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant 
17 ESA / D208671 
Biological Resources Assessment 
November 2010 
trees, shrubs, and the ground within grassla
nd for nesting birds, as several bird species known to occur in the area are shrub or ground nesters. 
 If active nests are found, clearing and construction activities within a buffer distance 
determined by CDFG or the qualified biologist 
(usually 300 ft. for nesting song birds and 
500 ft. for nesting raptors and special-status 
bird species), should be postponed or halted 
until the nest is vacated and juveniles have fledged, as determined by the biologist, and 

there is no evidence of a second attempt at nesting during the same year. Limits of 

construction to avoid an active nest should 
be established in the field with flagging, 
fencing, or other appropriate barriers; and 
construction personnel should be instructed on 
the sensitivity of nest areas. The biologist should serve as a construction monitor during 

those periods when construction activities will o
ccur near active nest areas to ensure that no inadvertent impacts to these nests will o
ccur. The results of the survey, and any 
avoidance measures taken, should be submitted 
to the Irvine Ranch Water District within 
30 days of completion of the pre-construc
tion surveys and construction monitoring to 
document compliance with applicable state a
nd federal laws pertaining to the protection 
of native birds.  
Special-Status Natural Communities 
For Pipeline Option 1, to avoid impacts to terrest
rial, special-status species, such as the orange 
throated whiptail, coast (San Diego) horned lizar
d, and coast patch-nose snake, and other animal species, the following measures should occur: 
 The applicant should retain a qualified biol
ogist with a CDFG Scientific Collection 
Permit and Memorandum of U
nderstanding to conduct preconstruction surveys for the 
California Species of Special Concern that have
 the potential to occur within the project 
impact area. These wildlife species include ora
nge throated whiptail, coast (San Diego) horned lizard, and coast patch-nose snake. 
All special-status wildlife species observed 
within the project site during preconstruction 
surveys should be relocated, at the approval 
of the City and CDFG, to an approved site 
with suitable habitat for these species. Surveys 
and relocation of wildlife may occur prior to construction; however, focused surveys 

must occur within 30 days prior to constructi
on to ensure that no special-status wildlife is 
present within the project site during constr
uction. Survey and re
location methods should be approved by CDFG prior to
 commencement of grading. 
 For Option 1 of the treated water pipeline, excl
usionary fencing (i.e.,
 silt fencing) should 
be installed around the perimeter of the c
onstruction area where native vegetation is 
present or where suitable habitat is present 
for supporting potentially occurring special-
status (terrestrial) species as determined 
by a qualified biologist. The exclusionary 
fencing should be backfilled (or buried) at th
e base of the fence to exclude reptiles from 
entering the work area. Installation of excl
usionary fencing should be verified by a 
qualified biologist prior to the commencem
ent of construction or ground disturbing 
activities. 
 Coastal sage scrub and coastal prickly pear succulent scrub communities that are 
disturbed by construction of the proposed 
project should be restored on a 1:1 ratio on

open space areas on the project site or on othe
r available property. A restoration plan 
should be completed and specifies, at a minimum, the following: (1) the location of 

mitigation sites; (2) the quantity and species of
 plants to be planted; (3) procedures for 
creating additional habitat; (4) a schedule and 
action plan to maintain and monitor the 
enhancement/restoration area; (5) a list of 
criteria and performance standards by which to 
measure success of the mitigation sites; (6) m
easures to exclude unauthorized entry into 
the revegetation/enhancement areas; and (7) 
contingency measures in the event that 
mitigation efforts are not successful. This restoration plan should be completed prior to 
construction of the proposed project. 
 A Eucalyptus Tree Cutting Permit should be obtained prior to cutting, pruning or 
removing any eucalyptus trees during the restricted period, April 1 through October 31. 

The transportation of or disposal of infected eucalyptus trees or logs should occur only as 

permitted. 
Wetlands and Riparian Areas 
Construction of proposed Baker WTP and the Ra
w Water Pump Station would be within the 
boundaries of the previously developed sites. No 
riparian or other sensitive habitats are located within these sites. Approximately 0.7 acres of
 CSS and 0.33 acres of coastal prickly pear 
succulent scrub would be directly impacted if pi
peline Option 1 is implemented. This would be 
considered a potentially significant impact. According 
to the City of Lake Forest™s General Plan Œ 
Recreation Element, the City will require modifications to the project to avoid the impact, or 

require mitigation measures to reduce the imp
act to these plant communities if impacts are 
determined to be significant. Implementation 
of the recommended Mitigation Measures identified below would reduce impacts to these native plant 
communities to less-than-significant levels. No 
other sensitive natural communities occur along th
e pipeline routes, which includes the proposed 
sewer line. 
Serrano Creek is located immediately to the s
outh of the proposed Baker WTP. During the 
reconnaissance survey, several runoff drains were observed on the existing facility site that 

appears to drain directly into Serrano Creek. Drai
nage into Serrano Creek is assumed, because the 
Baker site slopes to the south towards the Cr
eek. Implementation of the recommended Mitigation 
Measures identified below would reduce poten
tial runoff impacts to Serrano Creek during 
construction of the proposed treatment plant to less than significant levels.  
The habitat of Serrano Creek where the emergency overflow would occur is characterized as 
Southern Sycamore Alder Riparian Woodland; 
a CDFG-listed sensitive terrestrial community. 
Temporary emergency overflow events into the cr
eekbed would not result in any impacts to this 
sensitive natural community; however, small levels 
of sedimentation, siltation, or erosion could 
occur. Implementation of the recommended Mitig
ation Measures identified below would reduce 
potential impacts to Serrano Creek and the ripa
rian community therein to levels less than 
significant. To mitigate impacts to a level of less than si
gnificant, the project applicant should require 
construction contractors to implement the following measures
: Biological Resources Assessment 
 IRWD Baker Water Treatment Plant 
19 ESA / D208671 
Biological Resources Assessment 
November 2010 
 If Option 1 of the treated water pipeline is implemented, then coastal sage scrub and 
coastal prickly pear succulent scrub communities that are disturbed by construction 

should be restored at the same location wher
e impacts occur on a 1:1 ratio following the 
completion of construction activities. If coast
al sage scrub or coastal prickly pear 
succulent scrub would be removed for construc
tion purposes, a restoration plan should be 
completed that specifies, at a minimum, th
e following: (1) the location of replacement 
sites; (2) the quantity and species of plants to 
be planted; (3) a schedule and action plan to 
maintain and monitor the re-vegetation ar
ea; (4) a list of criteria and performance 
standards by which to measure success of th
e planting sites; (5) measures to exclude 
unauthorized entry into the re-vegetation/enhancement areas; and (6) contingency 

measures in the event that mitigation effort
s are not successful. This restoration plan should be completed prior to cons
truction of the proposed project. 
 The construction contractor should install 
temporary erosion control measures around 
drains to reduce impacts to Serrano Creek 
and protect on site drainages from excess 
sedimentation, siltation, and erosion. These m
easures should consist of the installation of 
silt fencing, coirs, berms, and dikes to 
protect storm drain inlets and drainages. 
 No changing of oil or other fluids, or discar
ding of any trash or other construction waste materials should occur on the project site. 
Vehicles carrying supplies, such as concrete, 
should not be allowed to empty, clean out, or otherwise place materials into natural areas 

on or immediately adjacent to the site. 
 Any equipment or vehicles driven and/or opera
ted within or adjacent to on-site drains should be checked and maintained daily, to pr
event leaks of materials that if introduced 
to Serrano Creek could be deleterious to a
quatic life. No equipment maintenance should 
be conducted near on-site drains. 
  The construction contractor will coordinate th
e points of discharge into Serrano Creek to 
construct discharge dissipation features such as (but not limited to) concrete blocks or 
rip-rap as necessary to reduce flow rate wh
ile reducing sedimentation, siltation, or 
erosion in the creek. In addition, IRWD will pursue all necessary federal and state 

permits and additional mitiga
tion measures that may be required as a component of the 
proposed emergency discharge into Serrano Creek. 
 Construction activities within Serrano Creek should be limited to periods where the 
channel is dry. IRWD should coordinate with local water districts to ensure that the 
channel remains dry for the duration of insta
llation of any discharge dissipation features. 
 No activities should occur within Serrano Cr
eek until appropriate permits have been 
obtained from the US Army Corps of Engin
eers (404), local Regional Water Quality 
Control Board (401), and/or California 
Department of Fish and Game (SAA) 5.3 Conclusions 
While the re-development of the IRWD Baker Tr
eatment Facility and associated construction at 
Peters Canyon Reservoir and connecting pipelines 
will take place primarily within the boundaries 
of previously developed facilities, the-proximity to nearby sensitive biological resources

necessitates care be taken with regard to those 
resources and that mitigation measures be put in 
place to protect them. The measures detailed in this
 report should be employed in order to reduce 
the level of impacts to biological resources to less than significant levels.

 Introduction
 In accordance with Section 15091(d) and Section 15097 of the CEQA Guidelines, which require 
a public agency to adopt a program for reporting 
and/
or monitoring required changes or 
conditions of approval to substantially lessen signif
icant envir
onmental effects, the
 Mitigation 
Monitoring and Reporting Program 
(MMRP) 
is hereby adopted for this project.
 This MMRP summarizes 
the
 mitigation commitments identified in the 
Baker WTP Project Final 
EIR (State Clearinghouse No. 
2010051055
). Mitigation measures are presented in the same order 
as they occur in the Final EIR. The columns in the 
MMRP 
table provide the following
