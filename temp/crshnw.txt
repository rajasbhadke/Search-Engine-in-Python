[] 1) Unauthorized Sysop Access:                              []
[]      -THIS  CAUSED BY A USER TYPING IN A PASSWORD THAT     []
[]       INVOLVES THE NUMBER ONE. (I.E. M1PQ, E1LH, P1TT,     []
[]       D1SK, ETC.). THESE USERS DO NOT HAVE TO KNOW YOUR    []
[]       PHONE NUMBER TO RECIEVE ACCESS.  AFTER THEY RECIEVE  []
[]       THE PROMPT: 'INVALID PASSWORD', THEY HAVE GAINED     []
[]       THE ACCESS THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO YOUR PASSWORD.     []
[]       FROM HERE THEY SIMPLY TYPE IN ANY NAME THEY PREFER,  []
[]       AND FROM THERE THEY ENTER NONE FOR THE TELEPHONE     []
[]       NUMBER AND BANG, FREE SYSOP ACCESS.                  []
[]      -IT IS CAUSED BECAUSE THE NETWORKS PROGRAM READS      []
[]       THE FILES AND LOADS THE FILES WHEN M1PQ, OR ANY      []
[]       OTHER PASSWORD IS ENTERED. NETWORKS DOESN'T CLEAR    []
[]       OUT THE VARIABLE JUST AS IT DOES WITH A NEW USER.    []
[]      -THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO ELIMINATE THIS: 1) MAKE THE    []
[]       USERS ENTER A VALID PHONE NUMBER, OR CLEAR THE       []
[]       VARIABLE OUT BEFORE ENTRY ONTO THE BOARD. 2)         []
[]       LOWER THE SYSOP ACCESS AND ONLY VALIDATE HIS         []
[]       ACCESS BEFORE HE IS GOING TO LOG ON THE BOARD.       []
[]       3) JUST CLEAR THE VARIABLE OUT AFTER THE USER        []
[]       ENCOUNTERS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ERRORS BEFORE       []
[]       BEING LOGGED OFF.                                    []
[]      -THE WAY THAT I FEEL WOULD BEST SUIT OUR PURPOSE      []
[]       IS FORCING THE USER TO ENTER A PHONE NUMBER,         []
[]       THUS CAUSING HIM TO GO THROUGH THE NEW USER PROCESS  []
[]       AND CLEAR OUT THE VARIABLE.                          []
[]      -I AM SURE THAT MOST OF YOU ARE SAYING TO YOUR-       []
[]       SELVES, "BIG DEAL" BECAUSE THE USER IS NOT           []
[]       VALIDATED.  IT MAY BE A BIG DEAL ON SOME SYSTEMS     []
[]       BECAUSE THE USER(HACKER) MAY BE ABLE TO READ SOME    []
[]       MESSAGES THAT ARE MEANT FOR VALIDATED USERS ONLY,    []
[]       OR THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET AN IDEA OF WHO IS ON      []

[] 2)Crashing with the Library                                []
[]      -ANOTHER WAY NETWORKS CAN BE CRASHED IS BY GOING      []
[]       TO THE LIBRARY OR THE 'G' SECTION AND TYPING ANY     []
[]       NUMBER THAT HAS A DECIMAL POINT IN IT. THAT DOES     []
[]       NOT EXCEED THE MAXIUM NUMBER OF THE MENU. (I.E.      []
[]       1.2, 3.2, 4.1, 5.6, ETC.).  THIS PROCEDURE WILL NOT  []
[]       DO ANY DAMAGE, UNLESS THEY TYPE: '1.SYS' AND WITH    []
[]       THIS AT HAND THEY CAN CAUSE THE COMPUTER TO TRY TO   []
[]       OPEN A FILE WHICH IS NOT THE PROPER ONE. FROM        []
[]       THERE IT MAY CAUSE THE COMPUTER TO GO INTO MONITOR   []
[]       AND WHICH AT THIS POINT, YOU ARE SCREWED.  GETTING   []
[]       BACK ON TRACK, THE FILES WHICH INCLUDE DECIMALS      []
[]       IN THEM ARE WRITING ONE SECTOR TEXT FILES TO DISK.   []
[]       CONSIDERING THAT MOST BOARDS RUN ON TWO DRIVES THIS  []
[]       MAY FILL UP A DISK REAL FAST.                        []

[]      -THE 99E99 TRICK, (WHICH WILL WORK WITH 99E98,        []
[]       99E97, ETC).  WILL CAUSE THE COMPUTER TO GO INTO     []
[]       MONITOR IF IT IS DONE ENOUGH.  THIS ONLY WORKS IN    []
