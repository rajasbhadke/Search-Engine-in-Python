The Other Side (Conflict Resolution Simulation)
Compatible: 48k Apple II+, //e, //c
Requirements: One disk drive; modems and second computer optional


     The Other Side challenges opposing players (or teams) to achieve peace through cooperation, symbolized via a "bridge" to which each side contributes pieces. Completing the bridge ends the game and both teams win. (One version awards "victory" to the side which places the last piece.)

     Since "both sides want peace", success might appear to be a foregone conclusion; not so! Whether you play the game using modems or a single computer, niether side ever sees the other's moves. Contact is limited to "Hotline" messages entered during a "communications" phase of each turn.

     More important, you are not the sole arbiters of national policy. Each side possesses a Computer Assisted Defense (CAD) system which cares only about the 'bottom line' and security. Should CAD decide you have let your side down or detect any hostile moves by the other side, it will attempt to sieze control; and its agressive moves will almost certainly provoke a similar response by the other side's CAD. Regaining control and avoiding a ruinous conflict can demand exceptional restraint as well as management skill from both teams.

     Complete with duplicate diskettes, manuals, plastic coated maps and modem software, "The Other Side" is an engrossing, realistic model of super power confrontation. If your gaming group has been looking for something "really different", you just found it.
