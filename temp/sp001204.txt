This story is almost too easy to believe.

Turns out (no surprise really) that the Internet domain registration 
monopoly (internic.net) is indeed owned by the 
military-industrial-biological complex. For once it's as if the 
double-speak vanishes and the truth is as open as a web page.

Now Internet domain registration will begin to be priced according to 
user-fees starting at $50 annually. One source, one collecter of fees. 
One databank with all Internet registration...

Scientific Applications International Corp.

To quote web reviews (emag):

"The company, with over 20,000 employees and 450 locations around the 
world, reported $1.9 billion in gross revenues in 1994. Over 90% of its 
income was generated by government contracts - more than half of that 
from defense, intelligence, and federal law enforcement contracts."

They are a large military technology corporation. Check out some of the 
projects that are listed in the corporate report:

- National Security: "Our advanced technology for the Army Global Command 
and Control System will allow quick response deployment and tracking of 
troops in simulated or actual evetns."

- Informaiton Management: "SAIC is supporting Department of Defence's 
renovation of the 52-year-old Pentagon, one of the largest buildings in the world and 
workplace for nearly 25,000 people. Under U.S. Army direction, our staff 
are creating an evolving building-wide "enterprise network" of shared 
communications and computing services. We are designing the network to 
operate more efficiently than today's disparate systems, yet require less 
human and fiscal resources to operate and maintain."

- Military Technology: "Our contribution to the U.S. Navy/Defense Nuclear 
Agency Electro-Thermal Chemical Gun illustrates this new focus."

WAIT A MINUTE, READ THAT SENTENCE AGAIN...

- Military Technology: "Our contribution to the U.S. Navy/Defense Nuclear 
Agency Electro-Thermal Chemical Gun illustrates this new focus."

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE DECIPHER THIS?

- Law Enforcement: "A new SAIC system will give federal, state and local 
law enforcement agencies fast, on-line access to criminal histories."

- Environment: "SAIC supports the decontamination and decommissioning of 
defense plants and military facilities."

These guys are some bad dudes.

To quote web review (emag):

"In 1990 SAIC was indicted by the Justice Department on 10 felony counts 
for fraud in its management of a Superfund toxic cleanup site. (SAIC 
pleaded guilty.)
In 1993 the Justice Department sued SAIC, accusing it of civil fraud on 
an F15 fighter contract.
In May 1995, the same month SAIC purchased NSI, the company settled a 
suit that charged it had lied about security system tests it conducted 
for a  Treasury Department currency plant in Fort Worth, TX. (The company 
paid the government $125,000 to cover the cost of the investigation as 
part of that settlement.)"

So why is this coming up now?

SAIC with the purchase of NSI, which owns Internic.net, now controls all 
Internet domain registration. A monopoly that now wants to charge $50 
annually for every domain name. Turn the funnels of money on.

For those who don't know internic.net is the "central" (catch that one), 
registration point for the Internet. Operated in conjunction with AT&T, 
internic.net is the biggest reference source on the net. Every time you 
send an email with an address like "lglobal.com", that name is referenced 
to internic.net and converted to an I.P. address such as 210.50.120.2 
which denotes network topography.

So again the military controls the maps and the bureacracy.

You've got to go see their board of directors page. It's incredible.

As an expression of global empire, SAIC is as naked as an oligarchy can be.
Their board of directors, 23 white men, 1 white woman, and 1 perhaps 
southern european woman. Two generals, one admiral, vice-chairman of bank 
of america.

goto http://www.saic.com/ and pick the corporate report.

it's some crazy pages, almost wonder if they're real...

power comes in many forms,
but there is only one power,
many faces.
and there is no freedom in the face of power.
