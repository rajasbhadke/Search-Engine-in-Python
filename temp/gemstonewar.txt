
GEMSTONE WARRIOR (Extended Arcade)
Compatible: 64K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, joystick optional


     When demons stole the great Gemstone humanity was deprived of its chief source of magic. Now threatened with extinction, all mankind turns to you, mightiest of warriors: fight your way through the Underworld and recover the five pieces of the Gemstone. Only thus may humankind be saved.

    "Gemstone Warrior" is a high-energy adventure set in a colorful maze of caverns and corridors. Untroubled by thoughts of monster welfare, peace, or similar avatar-like ideals, your basic objective is to kill anything that moves.

     Dead bodies, coffins, and chests yield gold, healing potions, extra lives, protective spells, and magic weapons, as well as restocking arrows and fireballs. With fifteen different magical artifacts (several of which have unknown uses), a major part of play is learning when to use which item. Gold, plus a juicy bonus if you rescue the stone, determine your score, the top five of which are retained on disk.

     Tight controls, and a good leveling scheme result in very challenging but winnable play for beginners and berzerker-class arcaders alike. The simple game save works well and, if you are killed, restart is almost immediate. Exceptionally addictive, Gemstone Warrior rangs solidly among arcade maze gaming's best.
