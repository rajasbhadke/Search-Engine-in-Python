That's a trifle optimistic - with a newly formed company (probably quite small,
with limited resources) you'll spend probably two years in bringing the game to
market for ONE operating system, and you'll be lucky if you can sell 10,000
copies EVER.

   Right Joey you are god.. As for Jason, Steve and Shawn,  doubt it very much
they will be part of the piracy scene.. Ahh, btw lets not get crazy here your
address and phone number can only do me good....


Farewell, and you will soon see how a product can sell 450,000 copies, easily..

   Yeah you are right Ralph vaporware like your helicoptor game that no one
will buy off you cause it is so lame.. The ware will not be discussed but it
should drve smaller companies off the map because of the price we can sell it
at.. Look in '90 april and may Incider/A+ for a full page color ad.. Oh, there
is no way in hell anyone will be able to crack it in less than 1 month, he he
but if you do try you will pay, and we have a serial number scheme, custom OS,
and we will prosecute anyone and everyone...
