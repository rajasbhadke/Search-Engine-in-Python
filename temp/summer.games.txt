-----------------------------------THE GAMES------------------------------------

POLE VAULT:
   
     * THE BAR IS INITIALLY SET AT 4 METERS. PRESS THE JOYSTICK BUTTON OR 
       RETURN OR SPACE. IF YOU WISH TO COMPETE AT THAT HEIGHT PUSH THE
       JOYSTICK FORWARD FOR 'YES' OR PULL BACK FOR 'NO'. YOU MAY ALSO 
       TYPE 'Y' OR 'N'. 
     * AFTER YOU ACCEPT A BAR HEIGHT, YOU MUST SELECT POLE GRIP. USE THE 
       JOYSTICK OR ARROW KEYS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HIGH, MEDIUM, OR LOW.

       BUTTON OR SPACE OR RETURN TO START YOUR RUN. NEXT, PULL THE JOYSTICK 
       BACK OR PRESS Z OR M TO PLANT YOUR POLE INTO THE VAULT BOX. (THE 
       VAULT BOX APPEARS AS A DARK NOTCH IN THE LANDING PIT).
     * NEXT, PUSH THE JOYSTICK FOWARD OR THE A OR I KEYS TO KICK UP OVER
       THE BAR. PRESS THE JOYSTICK BUTTON OR SPACE OR RETURN TO RELEASE
       THE POLE.

       THE DIVING BOARD.
     * USE THE JOYSTICK OR DIRECTION KEYS TO CONTROL YOUR BODY POSITION 
       AND ROTATION SPEED.
       THE A AND Z KEYS ARE UP AND DOWN. THE I AND M ARE ALSO UP AND DOWN
       AND THE J AND K KEYS ARE LEFT AND RIGHT. THE RETURN KEY AND THE
     AND THE SPACE BAR ARE THE ACTION KEYS.
     * YOU MAY ALSO USE THE REGULAR CURSOR KEYS (ARROW KEYS). THESE SAME 
       KEYS CAN BE USED IN ANY OF THE EVENTS TO IMITATE THE ACTIONS OF THE
       JOYSTICK.
     * THE BODY POSITIONS AND ROTATIONS FOR THE JOYSTICK ARE AS FOLLOWS:
           * RIGHT - FOR FULL TUCK
           * DOWN - FOR A PIKE POSITION
           * LEFT - FOR A HALF-PIKE
           * UP - FOR A LAYOUT
     * AFTER A DIVE, THE JUDGES' SCORES APPEAR IN THE BOXES ACROSS THE
       CENTER OF THE SCREEN. A DIVE ISN'T CONSIDERED PERFECT (FOR A SCORE
       OF 10 POINTS), UNLESS THE BODY ENTERS THE WATER VERTICALLY AND 
       FULLY EXTENDED. EITHER HEAD OR FEET FIRST.
     * A SECOND SCORING FACTOR IS THE DIFFICULTY RATING, BASED ON THE 
       NUMBER OF ROTATIONS. THIS SCORE RANGES FROM 1.0 TO 4.1.

       OF THE SCREEN TO MONITOR YOUR RUNNER'S ENERGY RESERVES.
     * ALL THE RUNNERS HAVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF STAMINA. RUNNER ONE CAN'T
       REGAIN HIS ENERGY AS FAST AS RUNNER FOUR CAN, WHILE RUNNER TWO LOSES 
       ENERGY FASTER THAN RUNNER THREE.
     * TO PASS THE BATON, PRESS THE JOYSTICK BUTTON OR SPACE OR RETURN.
