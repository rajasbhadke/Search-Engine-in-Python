
THE HALLEY PROJECT (Space Flight Simulation)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, joystick and tape casette optional


     From among thousands of applicants, you are one of the few selected to qualify for "The Halley Project", a top-secret deep space exploration program. Completing each of ten qualification/training missions advances you one rank, beginning with "Raven", then "Shrike", all the way through the exalted designation "Starbird". Should you prove to be one of the elite, the project and the galaxy are yours!

     Each mission begins with launch from a secret base on the comet and ends when you return having met all objectives. ("Land on any planet warmer than Callisto", "land on any moon smaller than Titan" are typical objectives.) While it is only necessary to complete a mission to advance, each is timed; and, along with each player's record, best mission times are maintained on disk.

    "The Halley Project" incorporates a twelve-constellation star map (showing bodies of 6th magnitude or brighter) and a remarkably accurate 'real time' model of the solar system. Except for loss of the console screen view (star map) during hyperspace jumps, the model appears to operate in all aspects of play including the zoomable ("radar") display of the solar system. Planets and moons revolve, rotate, and actually change size depending on distance.

     Complete down to a cockpit view of terrain when you land and a briefing tape, "The Halley Project" has it all. Boot the disk, start the tape, douse the lights, and get set for a fantastic gaming experience.
