  What is anarchism?  If we had an anarchist state wouldn't there
 be chaos?  Who would do the dirty work?  Aren't anarchists the
 ones who throw bombs and shoot people?  What if someone
decided they didn't want to work; could they get away with
being lazy?  Anarchism has changed over the years, but popular
 misconceptions remain.  It has come a long way since the days
 of "propaganda by the deed."  It is also nothing like the popular
 notion of anarchy as "chaos."  Even anarchists disagree on
what anarchism really means.  Anarchism has been around for
 a long time.  It is a worldwide phenomenon.  Most anarchists
 work towards a non-coercive, non-authoritarian society.  Most
 have a view that human nature is basically good, or at least
neutral.  Some anarchists are nonviolent and some believe
that some violence is allowable.  Most anarchists don't like
 governments and other institutions.  Some are vegetarians,
 some are vegans, and some eat hamburgers.  And the list
 goes on.  Anarchism is a very eclectic tradition.
 
         The anarchist movement has enjoyed a revival
over the last decade.  This resurgence has been a worldwide
 phenomenon.  Large gatherings, or conventions, have been
 held annually in North America since 1986,  the year the
 gathering celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Haymarket
 riot in Chicago.  The 1986 gathering had around 500
participants.  Last summer's (1989) gathering in San Francisco
 had over two thousand attendees.  The anarchist press is
 thriving; with many journals, magazines, and newspapers
being published just about everywhere.  Several small
publishers have recently reprinted "classical" works by
 anarchists.  These are usually about politics, philosophy
, or economics.
 
          This bibliography aims to help the layperson
or student who wishes to read about or learn more about
 anarchism.  A list of the more understandable works in
the field has been compiled, in order to  help the reader
 avoid the frustrations that can arise in reading a more
theoretical book.  Not all of these books are necessarily
 about anarchism. Selected works of fiction have been
 included to give the reader a more complex understanding
of the worldview of contemporary anarchism.  Many of
 these books have references to other works, and a list
of bibliographies has been included to help with any
further studies.
 
         Availability of the following materials varies.
 By their nature, materials of this sort are most often
published by small publishers or individuals and are
 usually not available in your typical mall bookstore.
  However,  many of these titles are available in public
 libraries, and still more can be found in college and
university libraries.  If you can find any anarchists in
 your town or city, they are usually more than willing
 to loan you their dog-eared copy of the book.  To help
the person who can't find any of these materials, a list
 of addresses of small publishers and alternative
vendors/bookstores has been provided.  If you contact
 any of the magazines listed, they can help you find
 most of these materials.  Some of these magazines have
 titles that are available for purchase (Fifth Estate
being the best example).

FICTION
 
 
 
Le Guin, Ursula K.
 The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia.
New York: Avon  Books, 1974.
 
 
A science fiction book set on two worlds: Annares
 and Urras.  Urras, the parent world, is a
hierarchical, industrial society.  Annares, the moon,
 features a society based on Taoist, anarchist and
libertarian principles.  Shevek of Annares, a great
physicist, travels to Urras after tiring of Annares'
 stagnation.  The novel portrays his travels and
experiences on both worlds.  Chapters alternate
between the two worlds and between time periods.
  In creating a convincing anarchist society, Le Guin
also manages to address the problems that arise in a
libertarian society.  A thought- provoking introduction
 to anarchist possibilities.  Recognized as a science
 fiction "classic."
 
 
 
 
Piercy, Marge.
Woman on the Edge of Time.
 New York: Ballantine, 1976.
 
 
        A novel about a woman, Consuelo (Connie)
Ramos, who has been labeled insane and left in an
 institution by her family.  Yet Connie is sane, and can
 communicate with the future, a future that features an
 egalitarian society
living in harmony with nature.
Piercy effectively contrasts the libertarian
 society of
the future with the madness of the present.  Is our
civilization, with all of our problems, really sane?  She
creates a stunning, convincing vision and tells an
empathetic story about a woman trapped by stark
realities.
 
 
 
 
Orwell, George.
 Animal Farm.
New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, c.1946.
 
 
      A popular allegory of the dangers of political
 revolutions.  Set on a farm where the animals over-
throw their human oppressor, the farmer, only to have
some of the revolutionaries become new oppressors.
 Two stories at once: a fable about barnyard animals,
 and an underlying critique of political revolutions,
the state, and hierarchy.  An entertaining critique of
both revolutionary communism and Western
democracies, written in a style easily understood by all.
 
NONFICTION
 
 
 
CLASSICAL  ANARCHISM  (??--1939)
 
 
 
 
Avrich, Paul.
The Haymarket Tragedy.
New Jersey: Princeton University Press,
 1984.
 
 
        A sympathetic and fascinating account of the
 events surrounding the 1886 Haymarket Riot in
Chicago by a sound scholar.  Eight prominent
anarchists were arrested after a bomb was thrown at
 a rally and a policeman killed.  Though no evidence
 ever linked them to the crime, they were convicted,
four were hanged, one committed suicide, and three
were pardoned.  Avrich documents the irregularities
 of the trial and the "red scare" that swept the country.
 He places the event in the context of American labor
history and creates a vivid portrayal of the anarchist
 movement at that time.  Avrich's book is  detailed,
comprehensive, and very readable.
 
 
 
 
 
Berkman, Alexander.
A.B.C. of Anarchism.
 London: Freedom Press, 1977,
   (originally
 published in 1929).
 
 
     Short, concise introduction to "classical anarchism."
  Berkman (1870-1936)
presents his case for "communist
anarchism."  He examines the difference between
 
"Individualists" and "Mutualists," and elaborates on
his beliefs in social revolution.
His question and
answer approach makes the subject very accessible to
the non-expert.  What is the cause of crime?  Do you
need government to tell you not to step in front of a
moving automobile?  Is anarchism violence?  Answers
 to these questions and many more.
 
 
 
 
Goldman, Emma.
Anarchism and Other Essays.
New York: Dover Publications, Inc. 1969
(originally published in 1917).

 over the course of her life.  Essays include:
 "Anarchism," "Minorities versus Majorities," "The
Psychology of Political Violence," "Prisons: A Social
 Crime and Failure," "Patriotism: A  Menace to Liberty,"
 "The Traffic in Women," "Woman Suffrage,"
"Marriage and Love," and several others.  Includes
a biographical sketch.  Reflects turn-of-the-century
 views and still relevant today.
 
 
 
 
 
ANARCHISM TODAY (1940--  )
 
 
 
Beck, Julian.
Life of the Theater: the relation of the artist to the
struggle
 of the people.
 New York: Limelight Editions: Distributed by Harper
 & Row, 1986, c.1972.
 
 
 Beck was a member of the Living Theater collective,
 a guerrilla theater troupe that traveled the globe
during the 1960's and early 70's.  The book is a collage
 of paragraphs, poems, thoughts, and meditations, all
written during his travels.  All add up to express his
vision of "the beautiful nonviolent anarchist
 revolution."
He argues that the actor's job is to make
 people feel.
 
 
 
 
Bookchin, Murray.
Toward an Ecological Society.
Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1980.
 
 
        A collection of essays that introduce the reader
to Bookchin's "social ecology."  He has collected
 these essays "to recover the very idea of a radical
critique of social life."  Thoughts on contemporary
radical movements and suggestions for alternatives.
 Essays cover such subjects as city planning, self-
management, ecotechnologies, ecocommunities,
Marxism, the urban future, and the prospects for
an ecological society.  Bookchin has contributed
many ideas to the new philosophies of ecology.  An
 excellent introduction to his more complex books.
 
 
 
 
Clark, John.
The Anarchist Moment: Reflections on Culture,
Nature and
 Power.
 Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1984.
 
 
 A philosophical approach to contemporary anarchist
issues.  Clark examines the interaction among
technology, nature, and culture.  He looks at the
anarchist philosophies in Lao Tzu.  The differences
between Marxism and anarchism are examined in
several essays.  He also includes a chapter that serves
 as an introduction to anarchism.  He discusses the
social ecology of Murray Bookchin.  An under-
 
standable, readable introduction to the philosophical
dimensions of anarchism.
 
 
 
DeLeon, David.
 The American as Anarchist: Reflections on
Indigenous Radicalism.
 
 Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 1978.
 
 
       A look at the "other" history of the United States.
 DeLeon shows that radicalism and resistance to
authority are as American as baseball, apple pie, and
 
Chevrolet.  He argues that this hostility towards any
 centralized institutions is a
common American value,
and has greatly affected many radical movements from
 America's beginning to the movements of the 1960's.
 
 
 
Devall, Bill and George Sessions.
 Deep Ecology: Living as if Nature  Mattered.
 Salt Lake City: Peregrine Smith Books, 1985.
 
 
        Examines the emerging ecological consciousness.
  Deep ecology is a deeper, more spiritual approach to
 Nature.  It goes beyond the limited piecemeal approach
to environmental problems and attempts to articulate
a comprehensive religious and philosophical worldview.
Although not a book about anarchy, one can find
many anarchist concepts and sensibilities here.
 
Free.
 Revolution for the Hell Of It.
 New York: The Dial Press, Inc. 1968.
 
 
 Your guide to 1960s anarchism.  Abbie Hoffman brings
 together a collage of materials: flyers, quotes, essays,
and photos.  This book documents the beginnings of
the Yippies.  He reflects on events such as the 1968
Democratic Convention in Chicago and the levitation
of the Pentagon.  Book effectively conveys the spirit of
 the 60s.  Abbie Hoffman was the true clown prince of
anarchism.
 
 
 
 
Illich, Ivan.
Tools for Conviviality.
New York: Harper and Row, 1973.
 
 
Illich has chosen "convivial" as a term to designate
 a modern society of responsibly limited tools.  He
goes on to illuminate society's need for appropriate
technology.  The sociological and philosophical
 aspects of current technology are examined.  He
shows how  "conviviality" can be applied to different
 social institutions.  Illich shows that humans are part
 of nature--not separate from it.  This book has
 influenced many anarchist writers.
 
 
 
 
Negrin, Su.
Begin at Start: Some Thoughts on Personal Liberation
and World Change.
Washington, NJ: Times Change Press, 1972.
 
 
       Writing from her personal experiences in various
political movements, the author creates a colorful collage
 of essays that connect personal liberation and world
change.  She does this in a style that most people can
 understand.  Negrin's perspective is markedly anarcho
-feminist.  She proclaims the desirability of questioning
 everything and proceeds to do so.  Utopia is necessary!
 
 
 
 
Read, Herbert.
Anarchy and Order: Essays in Politics.
Boston: Beacon Press, 1954.
 
 
 A compilation of essays by one of this century's most
 active anarchist writers.  Read writes about the
 philosophical and aesthetic dimensions of anarchism.
The main essay is "Poetry and Anarchism," written in
1938.  He sees this essay as a "personal confession of
faith."  He ponders the importance of poetry in an
industrial
 age.  Other noteworthy essays are: "The
Philosophy of Anarchism,""The Paradox of Anarchism,"
 and "Existentialism, Marxism and Anarchism."
 
 
 
 
Roszak, Theodore.
Person/Planet: The Creative Disintegration of Industrial
 Society.
 
New York: Anchor Press/Doubleday, 1977.
 
 
          A synthesis of ecological and psychological
theories.  His main argument is that "the needs of
the planet are the needs of the person" and that "the
 rights of the person are the rights of the planet."  He
 discusses the "third tradition" (anarchism) which he
 sees as fusing and also transcending the dichotomy
 between individual and collective.  Roszak believes
that the results of personal transformation are powerful
--capable of changing institutions, societies, and the
planet.
 
 
 
 
 
BIOGRAPHY AND AUTOBIOGRAPHY
 
 
 
Avrich, Paul.
An American Anarchist: The Life of Voltarine De Cleyre.
 New Jersey:
Princeton University Press, 1978.
 
 
   A scholarly biography of De Cleyre (1866-1912).
During her short life she was very active in the American
 anarchist movement, both as a writer and as an agitator.
 
A freethinker, feminist, and anarchist, she was widely
respected by the rest of the movement.  She was an
eloquent critic of state power and centralized
economics, but she also advanced her vision of a
decentralized libertarian society based on voluntary
cooperation and mutual aid.  Avrich portrays her
interesting life in a clear, understandable style.
 
 
 
 
Goldman, Emma.
Living My Life.
New York: Da Capo Press, 1970, c.1931.

Autobiography of America's most famous and influential
anarchist.  Goldman was a prolific writer, speaker, and
agitator.  In her account, she describes the events in
her life, the people she knew, her relationships, and
manages to convey her philosophies throughout.  In
spite of the many hardships she faced, Goldman
lived a rich and deep life.  Her personal story is an
accessible introduction to the complexities of anarchism.
 
 
 
 
Winslow, Kent.
Dreamworld..
Tucson: The Match!, 1988.
 
 
Why does one become an anarchist?  This autobio-
graphical novel answers that question and more.  Kent
Winslow is an anarchist living in the American
Southwest.  In his novel he tells of his struggles with
a tyrannical father, his resistance to the draft, and his
battles with schools, the police, and the courts.
Winslow honestly and insightfully portrays his life,
philosophies, and relationships.  His introspective
and frank style makes this book an engrossing
portrayal of what it means to be an anarchist in
contemporary America.
