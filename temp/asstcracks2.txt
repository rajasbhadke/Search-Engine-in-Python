
Assorted Cracks 2


From: hackett@obelix.gaul.csd.uwo.ca (Mike Hackett)

Well, I received so many requests for my GS cracks, I decided to dig out the
whole file and post it here.  I hope no one minds.  Anyway, here's my handy,
dandy AppleWorks DB of GS cracks - at least the ones I remembered to put in.
Many of these should allow you to transfer the program to hard disk unless
the programmers hard coded certain disk dependent stuff.  Often you can fix
that by just searching through the disk and changing any references to the
disk's name to "1/" so that they will look in the right place.  Other times
the programmers were just so sure that no one could break their protection
(ha!) that they made too many assumptions about where the program was to
overcome this.

Nonetheless, I think that most of these cracks are about the best solutions.
I took the trouble to check that I couldn't see a better place to put the
patch, and as you can see, many of them are simply one or two well placed
byte changes.  The reason I'm pointing this out is that many of the cracks
that I've seen in Computist and on Compuserve were not very good!  Most did
not even take into account hard drives, they just found _a_ way around the
protection scheme.  However, most of my own cracks were done long before I
had a hard disk, and since some were done for friends, I cannot test all of
them out.  If there are any problems found, or better solutions, I be glad
to hear about them.

Now, about the table: you'll need a block editor, of course.  Just find the
line that contains the name of the program (for those programs with
multiple entries for the same version, you must perform all changes), and
go to that block and byte offset within that block.  If there is a pair of
block/byte numbers, then that patch must be applied in two places
identically.  Check that the specified search pattern is indeed there before
changing anything.  If it isn't, then try to search the entire disk for that
pattern - it may be in a different place on your disk.  For patterns that
are marked (NU = not unique), this searching is not possible.  Finally, if
you've found the pattern alright, enter the replacement hex codes and you're
done (unless there's another entry).  Despite the length of this paragraph,
it really isn't that hard.

The entries with stars ('*') beside them have their full listings at the
bottom of the list as they were too long to fit in the table form.

Of course, here are the standard disclaimers: no guarantees, no refunds.
Your versions may be different from the one I had.  And, _never_ work on
your original disk.  You should first make a backup, using any standard disk
copier (i.e. not a bit copier), ignoring any errors incurred, so that the
copy won't have any of the garbage from the original.  Then apply the
patch(es), and if you like, copy the files onto another disk, or hard disk
if it works.  If there are any problems (or confusion) just let me know by
email (faster) or by posting.

Also, to fix a bug in S&V (don't remember what it was right now) change the
file TENNIS.SYS16, relative block 324 (need Block Warden to figure that out
- don't know the absolute block numbers for this one) byte $06D, enter the
following:

AF 34 C0 E0 29 0F 8F 34
C0 E0 AF 29 C0 E0 09 C0
8F 29 C0 E0 AF 35 C0 E0
09 18 8F 35 C0 E0 EA EA
EA EA

And in relative block 484, at byte $0C4, change the A2 00 to 80 0F.

That's all for now.  If there's anything missing, ask me again, I may have
forgotten to include some.  I know I don't have these: Immortal, Jack
Nicklaus Golf, Dungeon Master, Alien Mind (almost! - long time ago, though),
and I don't remember the others.  Oh, I also have several //e games cracked,
but they're not very organized, so if anyone wants something, ask me
individually.  Thanks.  BTW, if you play Pool of Radiance and don't yet have
my copier/patcher program (on AOL) - GET IT!  It makes life so much easier.
Last I checked over 150+ people had downloaded the first two versions (make
sure you get the newer one if you have POR v1.1).

  That is, you NOP out the DEC instruction and make the branch to be an
unconditional branch. If you want any other cheats or hints, let me know, I've

 That's it.  Alternately, you could use a block editor to "follow" the file
 THEXDER, and change relative byte $522C to $80

No one has yet responded to my offer to post this cheat, but it's
so short, that I've uploaded it anyway. (I used gscii+ 2.2 to encode
it).     Rocky Giovinazzo    giovin@medr0.ecs.umass.edu
