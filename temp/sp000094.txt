Our social institutions are founded on certain ideas; as long as the
latter are generally believed, the institutions built on them are safe.
Government remains strong because people think political authority and
legal compulsion necessary.  Capitalism will continue as long as such
an economic system is considered adequate and just.  The weakening of
the ideas which support the evil and oppressive present-day conditions
means the ultimate breakdown of government and capitalism.  Progress
consists in abolishing what man has outlived and substituting in its
place a more suitable environment.

"I've heard that anarchists don't believe in organisation."
I imagine that you have, but that's an old arguement.  Any one who tells
you that anarchists don't believe in organisation is talking nonsense.
Organisation is everything, and everything is organisation.  The whole
of life is organisation, conscious or unconscious.  Every nation, every
family, why, even every individual is an organisation or organism.  Every
part of every living thing is organised in such a manner that the whole
works in harmony.  Otherwise the different organs could not function
properly and life could not exist.
