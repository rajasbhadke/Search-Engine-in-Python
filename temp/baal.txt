Well, to start out with this game is tough. It says so on the front
cover of the instructions, so it must be true!

 Its June 5th 1999, your an archaeologist who has discovered a
scrawl from what seems to be a old man, or thing. You call your old
archaeologist professor and tell him of a stone with baal written
on it. Hearing the word Baal caused so much interest that he told
you not to touch it. He told you that the stone was "foretold by
an old scottish monk way back in the 12th century...." The stone
could cause death and destruction to the world at a time when man
was reaching for the stars. Later it was discoverd that the date
June 5th 1999 would be 666 if the 1999 was turned upside down! The
devil, satan!! The other archaeoligist moved the stone an Baal
rose, killing all in his sights! A War Council was formed to kill
this monster, elite warriors have been selected to fight Ball.....

     YOU are in charge of the Time Warriors and here are your TOP
SECRET MISSION INSTRUCTIONS. You must guide and control each Time
Warrior in his quest. Although it is impossible to say what horrors
you will encounter when you enter BAAL's lair, his enormous power
coupled with his huge army of monstrous bests make him an extremely
dangerous enemy.

 We pray you can do it, we know you can. Many lives will be lost
in the numerous bloody battles but BAAL must be defeated. If not
we run the risk of being ruled by a power crazy demon at best, at
worst the earth as we know it is doomed. OUR FATE IS IN YOUR
HANDS......

                           An Alternative Release


                         Game released by: The Firm
                 The Lexicon  714-627-0601  9600+ Only!
How to Solve MechWarrior:


This cheat has been provided so you can sit back, play the game, quickly
win, say to yourself "How neat!  I've won...", and stuff the game away in
your archives in a short period of time.

The basic premise behind Mechwarrior is that you're the only surviving son
of the leader of Ander's Moon.  A group of Mechs attacked the planet, killed
your family, and installed a new government on the planet.  They also stole
a valuable Chalice which is a heirloom of family power or something.  Your job
is to track down the killers, find the Chalice, and restore your family to
power on Ander's Moon.


When you start out, you will usually be on one of the Davion planets, but
might start out on a Kurita planet.  Travel immediately to the Kurita planet
of Land's End.

When you get to Land's End, enter the bar and order a drink.  The barkeep will
tell you to come back later.  Go to the mech complex and sell your Jenner, as
you won't need it for a while, and can make a nice profit here.  Besides, it
will be a lot more expensive to haul it along with you where you're going.

Go back to the bar.  The ruffian you meet there will tell you "Grig can be
found on...".  Make a note of the planet he gives you and go there.  I
have seen New Samarkand, Tabayama, and Delacruz often.  It will always be a
Kurita world.

When you get there, you will meet Grig.  Accept his mission to deliver a
packet to his agent on Dustball, and go there.  Dustball is a Steiner world.

When you get to Dustball, there will be a little scuffle.  You can either
FIGHT then RUN, or RUN then RUN.  Just make sure that you RUN the second time.
After that, go to the bar and order a drink.  The barkeeper will tell you to
return later, but you can just order another drink and he'll give you some
information and the name of a Marik planet, such as Gibson, Mosiro, or
Sadurni.  Travel there.

When you arrive on the Marik planet, go to the Mech complex.  The man there
will tell you that you might find Kangaroo Jack on Tancredi IV or Okefenokee
(Davion planets).  When you leave, you will be shot at by a sniper.  RUN.
When you get to the Davion planet, go to the bar.  Order a drink, and you'll
be introduced to a guy named Kearny.  He'll give you some information, and a
scrap of paper with an address on it, telling you to meet him there.  When you
leave the bar, go ahead and follow the address.  Then HIDE and FIGHT.

When you finish that, read the news net.  You'll note a few news items in
which you were involved.  You'll also get a message from Jordan Rowe, telling
you where the Black Widows currently are.  That's your next destination.  It
will be a Kurita world like Thestria or Proserpina.

When you get there, go into the bar.  You'll see some of the Black Widows,
and get a story.  CHALLENGE it.

You'll get in a fight, and some woman named Tasha will save your butt.  She'll
tell you that Matabushi is your enemy, not the Black Widows, and that Kearny
was just trying to get you killed.  Go ahead and leave the bar.

If you read the news net, you'll see that Tasha gave you some files supposedly
from Matabushi telling about your family's execution.  Read on, and you'll
find something about Matabushi announcing a new commercial strategy.  Another
news item from Jordan Rowe will tell you to meet up with Kearney on Albiero.
Go there.

When you get there, you'll land in the middle of a battle, and see Tasha.
Follow her.  You will see Tasha and Kearny confronting each other, and have to
decide whom to trust.  I would suggest you trust Tasha.

When the smoke clears, Tasha will give you a data disk explaining the action
which killed your family, and who was behind it.  She'll also give you five
million bucks, which isn't too bad.  She'll tell you that the Chalice you're
after is on a Kurita planet called Kirchbach (as far as I know, this is always
the same) guarded by four Battlemasters and one Warhammer.

Another loose end to tie up is Grig.  Head to the planet where you first found
him (New Samarkind, Delacruz, or Tabayama) and you'll meet a bum.  Ask him to
GO ON with his story.  Make a DEAL with him.

When you see Grig, WAIT for the situation to improve.  You'll get a chance
when there are only two guards with him, STRIKE now.  He'll try to make a
deal with you.  Don't go for it, and PULL THE TRIGGER.  You'll pocket some
easy cash.

You've now done everything you need to do except get the Chalice back.  The
above actions should have taken about a year of game time, meaning you've got
about four more years to go.  You should have about 10.5 million bucks, so go
ahead and invest in some mechs and crew.  SAVE THE GAME before you try to hire
any crewmembers, because the game will sometimes crash when you do.
You'll want to end up with a good crew and some good mechs, I would suggest you
get four Battlemasters.  You'll need money for this, and there are two ways you
can get it:

#1  Go around buying Mechs at industrial planets and Mech-manufacturing planets
    (such as Alshain (Kurita), Herperus II (Steiner), Calloway VI (Marik),
    Ares (Liao), and Marduk (Davion).  Other good planets include Amity,
    Alderbaran, and Galax.  Buy mechs at these planets, and travel to various
    backwater and out of the way places like Land's End and Baxley.  There are
    a huge number of these planets.  Anyway, you can sell Mechs at these places
    for a nice profit.

#2  Norton Utilities.  Save the game, NU it, and give yourself some cash.
    Money is offset 73 (49h).  Fill the three bytes with $FF, and you'll get
    about 16.7 Million.  Or if you're REALLY greedy, go to byte 76 (4Ch), and
    change that one to 01h to 0Fh (0Fh will give you about 250,000,000).

Once you get cash, hire a crew and start practicing doing jobs for the various
houses.  When your crew gets good enough (I suppose you could cheat for this
also, if you wanted to), go to Kirchbach and kick some butt.

End of game.
                       
I hope you enjoyed this little solve, and you'll see some more in the future.
In addition, I have done a set of docs to Mechwarrior, as the cracking groups
did not see fit to release them.

Hola, fellow humanoids! Well, Activision FINALLY  released the long awaited (at
least by ME)  Ghostbusters II!  And  frankly,  I'm rather  impressed.  Now they
could've done a little  better on the graphics  (like have an option to use 256
colors),  but what this game lacks in graphics,  it makes up for in sound!  The
game supports either AdLib or Roland sound boards  (neato, huh?). But if you're
stuck with only a PC Built in Speaker  (like me),  then fear not!  The sound is
STILL pretty good!  Oh, well.  Since you've probably noticed  all that  before,
let's get on to the game strategy.

Keep in  mind that  this  documentation is a  supplement for  the documentation
included  with the  Ghostbusters II package.  I've included  some  instructions
that can be found  in the regular  Ghostbusters II  manual for those of you who
lost them  (which most people  frequently do).  By the way, you  HAVE read  the
original docs, haven't you? Oh, well. Let us begin (again)!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Five years ago,  in the city of New York,  the Ghostbusters battled their first
major spiritual manifestation,  Gozer.  Crossing the proton streams produced by
their particle  accelerators, they managed to reverse  the dimensional  gateway
created by Gozer,  and send him back through  the portal.  In the process, they
destroyed  much of the  surrounding area,  which just so  happened to  make the
mayor a TAD upset.  Over the years,  they went out of business,  due to various
reasons,  one being the fact that the  supernatural occurances had  been halted
dramatically,  thus giving them  no ghosts to bust.  Upon declaring bankruptcy,
they went their separate ways.

Peter Venkman become the host of a talk show called "The World of the Psychic",
which basically only made fun of people who believed in such things. Ray Stantz
and  Winston  Zeddemore  opened  up an  occult  bookstore,  and entertained  at
children's parties. Egon Spengler took up scientific studies at a laboratory.

In the meanwhile,  The New York Art Museum  received a painting  of an  ancient
tyrant,  Vigo the Carpathian.  The painting had an arua of evil around it,  and
with good reason, for it was the resting place of Vigo's spirit, waiting to get
out.  The spirit needed a spark of energy to emerge into the real world, and it
just so happened that the spark needed was in the city's sewer, taking the form
of rivers of slime. This slime, being psycho-reactant, was created from all the
bad thoughts, actions, and attitudes of the bitter citizens of the Big Apple.

The slime  soon rose to the city's surface streets,  and it was soon discovered
by the people.  As each day passed,  the painting  of Vigo drew  power from the
slime.

Meanwhile, Spengler,  Stantz,  and Venkman had been reunited in order that they
attend court and face their prosecution.  Louis Tully,  an acquaintence of  the
Ghostbusters  was their lawyer  (strike one).  The exibits on  display included
some of the  Ghostbuster's  equipment,  such as ghost traps  and their particle
accelerators.  Also on display was a jar of the slime found in the streets. The
judge of the court  was none to pleased,  and sentenced  the Ghostbusters  to a
prison sentence and a fine of $10,000.  While screaming and shouting, the judge
failed to realize that the slime was acting up. At the height of his anger, the
slime  burst to  life,  and  the  spirits  of two  brothers  he had  previously
sentenced to death came forth,  attacking those in the courtroom.  Diving under
a table, he told the Ghostbusters he would  drop all charges if they caught the
two phantasms.  Having no other choice,  the Ghostbusters agreed, and they were
no sooner in their gear and ready to go.  Needless to say, they made a wreck of
the whole place, but they DID catch the two ghosts.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
                         
Ok,  that's the basic  background  to the game.  When you begin,  you will find
yourself in the  courtroom battling the two brothers.  You are at the bottom of
the screen,  with the ghost  trap positioned  in the center of  the screen.  To
capture the ghost, use your controlling device (keyboard,  joystick,  or mouse)
and manuever the  bullseye on  top of  one of the ghosts.  When he  is in  your
sights, hit the fire button to fire. He will undoubtedly move, so you will have
to move your  beam as well.  You will notice at  the top right-hand part of the
screen, there will be two energy bars. These represent the energy of the ghosts
you are attempting to capture.  Your object is to drain the bar completely.  At
that point, the ghost trap will automatically kick in and suck in a ghost. Also
note in the top left-hand corner,  there is a thermometer. If the meter reaches
the top, your pack will temporarily shut down due to overheating. When it cools
down, you will be able to fire again.  I recommend you NOT fire the accelerator
at open space, as it wastes energy dramatically.

After catching one of the ghosts,  you will have to get the other.  Do the same
thing to capture this one.  Make sure to watch  the thermometer,  and the slime
that the brothers and the slimer throw at you during combat.  Don't worry about
killing  the D.A.  in the back.  It doesn't really matter.  The judge cannot be
killed, so you need not worry about him either.

If you catch the two ghosts successfully,  you will experience  the first quote
digitized from the movie with great accuracy:  "Two in the box! Ready to go! We
be fast, they be slow!".  The judge will then release you, and the Ghostbusters
will be back in business! If you fail to capture the two ghosts, you will still
be allowed to go back into business, but you will owe a debt of $10,000.

You will next  find yourself in the firehouse.  You have several  options here,
those being:

   o Go to get more slime.
   o Answer the phone.
   o Test slime.
   o Visit Parkview.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

GETTING MORE SLIME
------------------
This should be the VERY FIRST move you make in the firehouse.  This option will
allow one of  the Ghostbusters  to be lowered into the  city's sewer  system in
order to get a psycho-reactant slime sample. Lower yourself  down to the river,
and press the fire  button to scoop up slime samples.  You will need to fill up
the vial with you  before you can go back up.  Be careful.  You must avoid  the
hand that pops out of the river, and also avoid getting slimed by any wandering
ghosts or spirits. If the hand grabs you, quickly shake back and forth to break
loose.  You will only be able to do this three times.  Also,  if you get slimed
more than three times by wandering ghosts, you will fall into the river.

ANSWER PHONE
------------
You will  get a chance to  answer the phone six times.  Each time,  you will be
answering a job call to bust some ghosts.  Upon selecting this option, a window
will appear with a picture of the Ghostbuster's secretary, Janine Melnitz.  She
will answer the phone by either saying "Ghostbusters...Whaddaya want?", "We got
one!!!!", or "Who you gonna call?". Again, each of these are digitized from the
movies.

TEST SLIME
----------
Since this is  psycho-reactant slime,  you will be testing its reaction to some
types of music. To select which music to play, move the arrow so that it points
to a small button  on the recorder.  After clicking on that,  select the  LARGE
button to start  playing the music.  The slime  will have a  ceratin  reaction.
Either it will explode,  or start to dance.  If it dances,  then that means you
now have a sample  of positive energy slime.  If it explodes,  you will have to
get some more.

VISIT PARKVIEW
--------------
If any of the Ghostbusters  fall into the river of slime,  they will end  up in
Parkview,  the local mental ward.  If this is the case,  and you wish  to break
them out, select this option.  You will then find yourself climbing on the wall
of the  institution on a rope.  Push to either the left or  the right and press
the fire button.  You will crash through one of the windows and enter the room.
There may be any  number of things in the room.  If one of the  Ghostbusters is
not there,  escape AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Staying too long will  make the guards
drop a net over you and take you away. To esacpe the room, wait for the rope to
swing by the window and then push forward and press the button.  If you do this
correctly, you will be back outside on the rope. If for some reason you wish to
leave the place entirely, move DOWN until you reach the ground,  where you will
drive away in the Ecto-1.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

After going through all this stuff for some time, Egon will make a Slime Blower
to shoot the positive energy slime. You will now have an option to "Take Statue
for a Walk", meaning you will animate the Statue of Liberty in order to go into
battle with Vigo the Carpathian. DO NOT select this option until you have THREE
vials of  positive slime  (the vials will  be shown to the  bottom right of the
list with all the Ghostbusters' names. Just keep getting more slime and testing
it. When you test ALL of the sound tracks, you will end up with three vials.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

MOVING THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
----------------------------
Simply move your controller to  the northeast and northwest.  Observe the move-
ment of the statue's feet, and how they interact with your controller. In time,
you will get the hang of it and be able to move quickly.  To stop the statue at
an intersection  in order to turn,  manuever both of its feet  so that they are
both resting on the ground.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
                    
A TIP: Like I said before,  the FIRST MOVE  in the firehouse you should make is
getting some slime.  After doing so, DO NOT test it.  Rather, answer the phone.
Egon will offer to stay behind and run tests. When you come back from the call,
he  will have  finished his tests,  and inform you  that he  found  a bad sound
track. He will, however, have kept the slime from exploding. That way, you will
not have to go  back for more  slime!  Answer  the phone  again  to repeat this
process.  Keep in mind  that WHENEVER  you answer a  call and there  is a slime
sample still intact, Egon will stay behind to test it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Well, that should be enough  information to get you started!  I'll leave you to
battle Vigo yourself  <grin>.  If you have any problems,  or any other tips for
this game, contact me at the number below. Also, I am getting into the habit of
writing  documentation files  for other games,  so if you happen to find a game
with little or no docs whatsoever,  give me a call,  and I'll write one up if I
can. Have fun!!!!
