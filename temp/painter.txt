            THE PAINTER V3.1

(W) Written in 1984 by THE FAMOUS GUMBY
---------------------------------------

THE PAINTER is a powerfull utility that allows you to write your name on hi-res pages that don't show up in the catalog of a disk.

Here are some examples:

Donkey kong, Aztec, Dark crystal, etc..


COMMANDS
--------

The (ESC) key  toggles between the text page and the hires screen.


The Main Menu
-------------

Once THE PAINTER program is booted, you will be presented with the main menu.

Here are some fonctions:

C: Clears the current hi-res screen.
L: Loads a hi-res page from disk.
S: Saves a hi-res screen to disk.

R: Reads data from the disk in drive 1.
W: Writes  data to the disk in drive 1.

P: Parameters ( more on that later ).

;: Reads tracks  by steps of 2.
-: Reads sectors by steps of 2.


When  loading or  saving a hi-res page, you can see  a  catalog of the drive by pressing the letter  C (as a file name) and pressing the (RETURN) key.


The Parameters Menu
-------------------

Once you press P from the main menu,you will be brought to the parameters menu.

To return to the main menu,simply press the (space) bar.

As in the main menu, (ESC), ;, -, R, W, will retain their functions.

You can move the cursor by using either arrow keys ( <-  -> ). The (return) key is used to select the options.


Start trk: Starting track to read data.
Start sec: Startinc sect. to read data.

Trk stat.: Increment or decrement by 1.
Sec stat.: Increment or decrement by 1.


Save prms: Saves the parms to the disk.
Load prms: Loads the parms to the disk.


Slot  : Always slot 6.
Drive : Toggles between 1 or 2.


Note: Raw data will always be read from       drive 1 and dos 3.3 parameter and       hi-res files from either drive.

As always, inputing  the letter C, will show you a catalog of the current drive


And now... how to work the thing.

Once the disk has been cracked , put it in drive 1, then press the (ESC) key to see the hi-res page.

Press R ( to read raw data from disk ). If you see no part of the hi-res page , press the  ';' key to read the next two tracks.

Repeat this  until  you see part of the hi-res picture. Then press  P  and note what track it's on.

You  can  fine   tune  the  picture  by changing the sector number.

Once you have the full  hi-res  page on the screen, save the parameters to disk and save the screen also by choosing  S from the main menu.

( you can now  alter / modify the saved   screen  with  your  favorite  graphic   program. )

Once that's done, reload the parameters and the saved file and press W to write it back to the disk as raw data.

note: if the loaded picture is reversed       on the screen , change the status       of the track and sectors.


Some examples

ZAXXON:     TRACK  : 16
            SECTOR : 06

        TRK STATUS : Decrement
       SECT STATUS : Decrement


DONKEY:     TRACK  : 13
