Copyright (C) 1992 by Lisa Gronke. See the introduction to The Bit
Bucket Bulletin Board List (Long) for explanatory information and
copyright restrictions. BBS that have a dedicated phone line (even
though they may be offline at certain times for maintenance, local
use, networking, or to observe the Sabbath) will be found on the Long
list. This listing covers only BBS that do not have a dedicated phone
line and an occasional system that is under development.

Please observe the BBS hours. If you are making your first call to one
of these systems, try voice first at a reasonable hour to be sure that a
modem is answering.
