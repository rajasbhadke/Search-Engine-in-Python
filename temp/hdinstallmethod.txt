                Hello,

        Here is the english translation for the hd install doc. 
You'll see that will be not perfect (I was watching tv when I do that).
The best solution will be that you turn the text in a good english form
and you mail me again, I'll verify it is ok.
(sorry Tiny Death but I couldn't write you...Email problem ??)

                         INSTALL HD   Version 1.0, may 1991

                               (c) 1991, Phoenix Corp.

This soft let you install on the hard disk most of programms. In this version,
Install HD includes a patched system for the Prodos 16 (version 1.6), a
special launcher for the Prodos 8 and a patched version of DUNGEON MASTER.

For the P16:

- Install SYSP16 on root of the volume partition : that will be the same 
thing that the SYSTEM folder for the Prodos 16 programs.
- Put too the NEWPRO file (it can be renamed as you like). The SYSP16 folder 
must include P16, SYSTEM.SETUP, DRIVERS and if you want DESK.ACCS but TOOLS
and FONTS are not necessary and take space for nothing. The START file must
be present.
- Create a folder on this same partition where you want. The name of this
folder must be the same that the name of the volume (name of the disk) of the
soft you want to install. This folder will be called the installation folder.
- In this folder, just install and other folder called SYSP16 but this time 
without the SYSTEM.SETUP, TOOLS, P16, DRIVERS and DESK.ACCS. But you have to
put the tools and the fonts necessary (and only these ones, to avoid to loose
space).
- The files of the application which are in the SYSTEM folder on the
application disk must be put in a SYSTEM folder, just under the installation 
folder. For exemple, the START file of the application (different of the START
file in the other SYSP16 folder which is here to patch the system). But, if
the soft use theses files via a prefix with a number (1/ for */SYSP16 for
exemple), you will have to put them in the SYSP16 folder and not in the
SYSTEM folder, but it is very rare.
- Install the others files of the application in this subdirectory (except
for the PRODOS file, it is useless).

To sum up, on a partition of the hard drive (not necessary the first one)
/HARD2 and for an application /APPLI, we have :

/HARD2/

       PRODOS                           ; no change
       SYSTEM                           ; no change
       SYSP16/                         ; new, SYSTEM for PRODOS 16
              SYSTEM.SETUP
              DESK.ACCS
              DRIVERS
              P16
              START                     ; main program
       NEWPRO                          ; new, PRODOS for PRODOS 16
       APPLI/                          ; new, include the application files
              SYSP16/                 ; new SYSTEM local for P16
                      TOOLS/
                      FONTS/
              SYSTEM                    ; new, no-system file.

You have now 2 solutions :
- Put the name of the SYS.16 application in STARTUP position in NEWPRO and
launch NEWPRO with the prefix of the folder of the application to launch
(not easy...).
- Use PROSEL or WINGS. Put the title as you like, the prefix of the folder of
the application, the application to launch as NEWPRO (that you can rename) 
with his way from the root because of the indicated prefix and in STARTUP 
position, the application to launch, in AN ABSOLUTE path but from the folder 
where it is launched (only if it is, else nothing as path, only the 
application name).


Exemple: Test Drive II

On the partition 4 on a HD with a volume name as TEST.
We want to put Test Drive in /TEST/GAMES/TD2MASTER

On a donc

/TEST

   PRODOS
   SYSTEM ...
     .
     .
     .
   NEWPRO
   SYSP16-----P16
              SYSTEM.SETUP
              DESK.ACCS
              DRIVERS
              START   (START included with patch disk).

   GAMES------TD2MASTER-----TD2.SYS16
                            SYSP16-------TOOLS
                                         FONTS

Specifications for PROSEL 16:

Title: Test Drive II
Prefix: /TEST/GAMES/TD2MASTER
Appli: /TEST/NEWPRO
Startup: /TD2MASTER/TD2.SYS16 or TD2.SYS16

note: The SYSTEM folder (under /TEST/TD2MASTER) doesn't exist because it is 
useless, the application hasn't any specific files in his SYSTEM folder.


If a ramdisk (/RAM5 create by the memory manager) is available, it will be 
destroyed. Then, the data on the ramdisk will be lost if you use a program 
patched with HD INSTALL. But, like the BRAM data are not modified, the 
ramdisk will be recreate when you will return to the finder/launcher. 
This let you launch Test Drive II without changing the control panel and 
rebooting with a COLD SHUTDOWN to launch it when we have a ramdisk.

It is possible to put in the 'STARTUP' a second access path, separated with 
a comma (','). This path (optional) is a path for the second 3,5p disk. The 
name for this folder will be the name of the volume of the second disk. It 
can be on a different partition.


Exemple: Rocket Ranger.

On the partition 4 of a HD with a volume name as TEST. As the application has 
two disks (with names: /ROCKET.RANGER1 for disk one, /ROCKET.RANGER2 for disk 
two), we are going to install the application on the HD in two subdirectories:
/TEST/ROCKET.RANGER1 and /TEST/ROCKET.RANGER2.

Then we have

/TEST

   PRODOS
   SYSTEM ...
     .
     .
     .
   NEWPRO
   SYSP16-------P16
                SYSTEM.SETUP
                DESK.ACCS
                DRIVERS
                START   (START included with the patch disk).

   ROCKET.RANGER1-----RR.SYS16
                      SYSP16------TOOLS        ;  included just the TOOL025
                      SYSTEM------CW             ; the only file 
                      FONTS
                      GFX
                      SND
                      TXT

   ROCKET.RANGER2-----GFX
                      SND
                      TXT


Specifications for PROSEL 16:

Title: Rocket Ranger
Prefix: /TEST/ROCKET.RANGER1
Appli: /TEST/NEWPRO
Startup: /ROCKET.RANGER1/RR.SYS16,/TEST/ROCKET.RANGER2

or Startup: RR.SYS16,/TEST/ROCKET.RANGER2

Note: The SYSTEM folder (under ROCKET.RANGER1) includes only CW because it is 
the only appliaction file in his SYSTEM folder. We could put all files in one 
folder, then we have just to put all files of GFX, SND and TXT folders (under 
ROCKET.RANGER2) in the respective folders under ROCKET.RANGER1.


For the P8:

- You create a folder with the same name that the application volume's name.
- The Launch.System program must be in the folder of the appliaction to launch.
- We launch it with the folder application as prefix, LAUNCH.SYSTEM as 
application and original application as STARTUP. We can put 'STARTUP' as 
definitive (for the finder for exemple) or as optional (for PROSEL or WINGS).

Exemple: Zany Golf

Same thing that for Test Drive II, we want to install it in 
/TEST/GAMES/ZANY.GOLF/DISK

We have


/TEST

    GAMES/ZANY.GOLF/DISK------LAUNCH.SYSTEM
                              DOS8.SYSTEM
 .                                 .
 .                                 .
 .                                 .

  For PROSEL, we will have:

Appli: Zany Golf
Prefix: /TEST/GAMES/ZANY.GOLF/DISK
Appli: Launch.System
Startup: DOS8.SYSTEM

For Dungeon Master:

Only the patched files of Dungeon Master are available in the folder. Then 
you have just to copy this folder anywhere on the hard drive including the 
missing files : DUNGEON.BONUS, DUNGEON.GAME, DUNGEON.KEY, GRAPHICS.GAME. The 
DUNGEONSAVE folder will include the saved games. To launch Dungeon Master, 
just launch the START file, not the DUNGEON MASTER file !!! The program runs 
well under GS/OS 5.04. But if you have only 1.25 MB of memory (or less) 
should be carreful at the NDA, CDA, INITS... because they take space ram and 
the program could crash... The best thing to do is to purge the memory before 
launching Dungeon Master, Prosel can do that. You can launch the DM.START 
file instead of the START file, it purges the memory and launchs after the 
START file.



Restrictions : - Only one volume is supported for the application for the 
Prodos 8 version. For exemple, the Battle Chess version  that I have patched 
can't run with this system, you have to use the no-patched version (or wait a 
new version).
        - Only two volumes for the application under Prodos 16.
        - No versions for GS/OS.
        - Difficult installation for the Prodos 16 version. Especially to 
support the SYSP16 (used by all the applications).

Notes : - This progam is interresting for the games, it will be stupid to use 
a prefessional application which doesn't run under P8 or GS/OS.
        - The One Volume Limitation for the Prodos 8 is not very important, 
because it doesn't exist a lot of Prodos 8 program which need more than one 
volume.
        - Same thing for the Prodos 16 program : most of them which are 2 or 
3 disks can be placed on a hard drive.
        - There is no GS/OS version of this program because most of the GS/OS 
program can be installed on a hard drive.
