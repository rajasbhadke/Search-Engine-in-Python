 just fill out the following information and return to me in Email
 on this or any other BBS on the current list.  You'll be added to
 next month's listing if returned by the 25th of this month.
 Please drop me a note at any time with any permanent changes that
 occur to your BBS, also.  Additional info limited to 5 lines.
         Hopefully this list will help area users find all the
 exciting places they can call, resulting in all BBS's getting
 greater exposure and having more callers.
