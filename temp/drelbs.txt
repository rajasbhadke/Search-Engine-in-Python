HOW TO PLAY
-----------
YOU FIRST APPEAR ON THE ATOMIC FLIP  
GRID IN THE CENTER OF THE DRELBISH
KINGDOM. YOU WILL NOTICE THAT AS YOU 
HOP AROUND THE GRID, YOUR MOVEMENT   
CAUSES GATES TO SHIFT POSITION 90 
DEGREES. YOUR OBJECT IS TO CLOSE OFF AS
MANY OF THE SQUARES AS POSSIBLE BY
FLIPPING SHUT GATES OF 3/4 COMPLETED
SQUARES. IN OTHER WORDS, MAKE A SQUARE
OUT OF FOUR GATES. WHEN A 3/4 SEALED 
BOX IS CLOSED BY A GATE FLIP, IT WILL
TURN INTO A PULSING SQUARE. IN EACH
ROUND YOU MUST SECURE ALL OF THE  
SQUARES POSSIBLE ON THE GRID. THERE ARE
EIGHT ROUNDS TO COMPLETE THE GAME.
YOU HAVE 5 DRELBISH LIVES TO COMPLETE
YOUR MISSION.

WHEN YOU HAVE COMPLETED ALL THE SQUARES
POSSIBLE ON THE GRID, THE SQUARES WILL
BEGIN TO FILL UP WITH GORGOLYTES AND
DRELBISH WINDOWS. WAIT PATIENTLY AND
JUMP THROUGH THE DRELBISH WINDOW INTO
THE DARK CORRIDOR. YOU ARE NOW IN THE
LAND OF THE GORGOLYTES, SLAVEMASTERS
TO THE DRELBS. YOU WILL BE ON A SCREEN
FILLED WITH DRELBS AND A PURSUING
GORGOLYTE(S). GO OVER AND TOUCH AS MANY
DRELBS AS YOU CAN, THEREBY FREEING THEM
AND GIVING YOU BONUS POINTS. IF YOU
ARE STOPPED BEFORE YOU FREE EVERY ONE
OF THE DRELBS THEN YOU ARE TOSSED BACK
ONTO THE GRID. IF, HOWEVER, YOU ARE
SUCCESSFUL IN FREEING ALL OF THE 
ENSLAVED DRELBS THEN YOU WILL BE 
TRANSPORTED TO THE BONUS SCREEN, AND
THERE YOUR BONUS POINTS WILL BE ENTERED
TOWARDS THE GOAL OF FREEING ALL THE 
DRELBS FROM THEIR FATE.

HEARTS
------
AFTER A CERTAIN TIME HEARTS WILL APPEAR
ALONG THE CORRIDORS OF THE FLIP GRID.
YOU MUST PURSUE THESE FOR THEY ARE
MAGICAL INDEED. WHEN YOU RUN OVER A
HEART, IT WILL FREEZE THE CURRENT ENEMY
FOR FIVE SECONDS DURING WHICH YOU CAN
HOP QUICKLY AND TRAP THEM IN A SQUARE.

DIAMONDS
--------
OCCASIONALLY, A MAGICAL DIAMOND WILL
APPEAR ON THE FLIP GRID. PASS OVER IT
BEFORE IT DISAPPEARS AND IT WILL OPEN
A DRELBISH WINDOW INTO THE DARK
CORRIDOR.

THE MYSTERY LADY
----------------
WHENEVER THIS FACE APPEARS IN ONE OF
THE GARGOLYTE SQUARES, HOP QUICKLY TO
THE SQUARE AND STEAL A KISS FROM THE
DAMSEL. IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL, YOU WILL
JUMP TO THE BONUS SCREEN. AFTER ALL THE
ENSLAVED DRELBS ARE FREED, YOU WILL
DISCOVER THE SECRET OF THE MYSTERY
LADY.

TROLLABOARS
-----------
THESE SQUARE HEADS HUNT DRELBS FOR THE
FUN OF IT. THEY CAN FLIP GATES, HOWEVER
THEY CANNOT COMPLETE SQUARES OF THEIR
OWN. YOU CAN ALSO TRAP THE TROLLABOARS
INSIDE THE SQUARES THAT YOU COMPLETE.
THIS IMMOBILIZES THEM ONLY A SHORT
TIME, WHEREUPON THEY BREAK FREE AND
DESTROY THE CURRENT SQUARE.

GORGOLYTES
----------
THE GORGOLYTES WILL TRY TO POP INTO THE
FLIP GRID. YOU WILL SEE THEIR FACES
HAUNTING YOU. DON'T LET THEM INTIMIDATE
YOU. WHILE THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE DARK
CORRIDOR, THEY CANNOT HARM YOU ON THE
GRID UNLESS YOU RUN INTO ONE OF THEM.
THEY WILL DESTROY BOXES IN WHICH THEY
APPEAR AND BE A GENERAL NUISANCE.

SCREWHEAD TANKS
---------------
THE SCREWHEAD TANKS CONTROL THE  
PERIMETER OF THE ATOMIC FLIP GRID. THEY
FIRE DREADFUL BULLETS THAT RICOCHET OFF
THE GATES OF THE GRID. BE CAREFUL TO 
AVOID THE TANKS AND THEIR BULLETS,
OTHERWISE IT'S GOODBYE DRELB.

BONUS SCREEN
------------
YOU WILL ENTER THE BONUS SCREEN EITHER
BY KISSING THE LADY THAT APPEARS IN
THE GARGOLYTE BOXES OR BY COMPLETING A
ROUND OF THE DARK CORRIDOR. YOU WILL BE
AWARDED A BONUS EQUIVALENT TO 250 TIMES
THE NUMBER OF THE COMPLETED SQUARES ON
THE ATOMIC FLIP GRID. THEN, YOU WILL
BE TRANSPORTED BACK TO THE FLIP GRID TO
BEGIN THE NEXT ROUND.
