INTRODUCTION:
-------------


After a fun-filled day of adventuring, Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper accepts your
hard earned data and makes a high-resolution map on your printer. This map is
the starting point for your next outing. Your Quick-Draw map grows along with
your knowledge of your adventure.

The Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper is a companion to any adventure game. It
supports the following features:

- Prints a high-resolution map showing all rooms and their connections.
- Draws each room showing the room title, the room #, or if you want, both.
- Shows which room connections are "one-way".
- Adds new rooms and information at any time.
- Stores the mapping data for 4 adventures.
- Prints a summary of all adventure information.


----------------------
HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
----------------------


An Apple ][/][+/][e with 48K or 64K of memory and a single disk drive are
required. A dot matrix printer is required for to print the maps and
information summaries.

Included in this file is a list of printers and interfaces supported by
Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper. Appendix I shows how to configure Quick-Draw
Adventure Mapper for other printers and interface cards.


--------------------
LOADING THE PROGRAM:
--------------------


Place the diskette in drive 1 and turn the computer on. The first time it is
loaded, Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper will automatically run the configuration
program which will allow you to change several default settings and to specify
your printer and interface.

From then on, when QDAM is booted, it will begin with your selections. If you
wish to change them in the future, or if someone else configured your copy, hit
<ESC> immediately after booting. This will run the configuration program.


-----------------------
CONFIGURING THE SYSTEM:
-----------------------


During configuration, QDAM will ask you 7 questions, as follows:

[1] Your printer's name.
[2] Your printer interface's name.
[3] The slot your printer's interface is in.
[4] If your interface uses a second slot, the number it is in.
[5] Map printing option.
[6] Map entrance/exit display option.
[7] Map graphics density.

For items [1] and [2], you select your printer and interface from the list of
supported peripherals. If your printer and/or interface is not shown, then see
Appendix I on how to customize QDAM for your printer and/or interface card. The
3rd item is the slot your printer interface is in (usually Slot 1). The fourth
item is only required for certain interface cards, such as the Versa-card,
which use 2 slots.

For the last 3, "Numbers", "Yes", and "Single" would be good choices until you
are familiar enough with QDAM to decide you want anything changed. Their
purposes are fully explained in section 7.


------
MENUS:
------


QDAM accepts commands from the menu on the bottom line of the screen. Typing
the first letter in the command's name is all that is required to specify that
command. Many of the commands will bring up more detailed menus.

 / Section 2 /
/___________/


---------------
ROOM PLACEMENT:
---------------


QDAM uses a grid that is 19 rooms across by 13 rooms down for a total of 247
rooms per map. Rooms can be positioned anywhere on that map.

Infocom games, considered the most advanced have the following #'s of rooms in
their 13 adventurers:

[01]    Zork I          110
[02]    Zork ][         086
[03]    Zork ///        089
[04]    Enchanter       074
[05]    Sorcerer        084
[06]    Starcross       086
[07]    Suspended       063
[08]    Planetfall      105
[09]    Deadline        051
[10]    Witness         031
[11]    Infidel         077

NOTE: This list does not include SeaStalker or Cutthroats. The numbers here may
also be deceiving. The # here are the # of internal rooms in the programming,
many of which, in some cases, can not be entered by the player.

As you can see by the above list, 247 rooms is plenty for almost all
adventuring needs.


------------------
MOVING THE CURSOR:
------------------


The room selection cursor is positioned in the upper left corner when the
program is first booted. The cursor can be moved anywhere on the upper portion
of the screen. The table below shows the keys that move the cursor:

  U  I  O

  J  *  K

  N  M  ,

The arrow keys may also be used on a 2e.


----
ADD:
----


The ADD command places a room at the current cursor position. As soon as you
press the "A" key, the screen should flip to the room information entry
display. The ADD command automatically moves you to this new screen and menu
since you will usually want to enter room information as soon as you add the
room. For now, press the L key to LEAVE and go back to the previous menu.

There are 3 things you should now notice:

- There is a colored box in the center of the screen, representing the room you
  just added.

- The "SELECTED" area displays blanks instead of the flashing message:
  "* * * EMPTY * * *". It is really displaying the title of that room, but
  since we haven't entered a title yet, there are only blanks there. The "ROOM"
  number shows "1".

- The menu is now different. The ADD command is now gone, and in its place are
  DELETE, EDIT, and VIEW.

Since there is a room at the current cursor position, we can't add one. We can
DELETE it, EDIT its information, or VIEW its information.

Move the room cursor again. As you move the cursor, the "SELECTED" indicator
will change between the empty indicator and the room's title. The menu will
change depending whether the current cursor position is on a room or not.

Room numbers are automatically assigned as the rooms are entered. The lowest
available number is always used.

-------
EXTRAS:
-------

The XTRAS command calls up another menu containing special features that will
be explained later.

-----
VIEW:
-----

The VIEW command displays all of the information entered about the currently
selected room.

-----
EDIT:
-----

The EDIT command displays the same information as the ADD command and allows
you to change any or all of it.

------
LEAVE:
------

The ADD, EDIT, or VIEW commands all bring up new menus. All of these new menus
have a LEAVE command, which returns you to the previous menu.

-------------
TEXT EDITING:
-------------


Most of the information entered into QDAM consists of text such as:

- Room titles
- Items found in rooms
- Pathways or connections between rooms
- Comments about a room
- File titles for saving your information

The text editing commands are explained below. In the following section, you
will have many opportunities to practice them.


---------------
BASIC CONCEPTS:
---------------


Text editing is always performed within a rectangular area of the screen, whose
position is dependent on the information being supplied. This area can consist
of a portion of a single line or encompass several lines on the screen. When
multiple lines are involved, a word that is too long to fit in the remainder of
the line is automatically moved down to the next line.


-----------------
EDITING COMMANDS:
-----------------


Only upper case characters can be accepted. Newly typed characters replace
those that previously occupied their positions. Some special command characters
are recognized:

RETURN:                 -Signals the completion of all editing. The contents of
                        the current editing area accepted as displayed.

ESC:                    -Initiates a mode that allows athe cursor to be moved
                        within the current editing area. In this move, the "I"
                        key will move the cursor up one line (or the beginning
                        of the current editing area), the "M" moves the cursor
                        down one line (or to the end of the editing area) and
                        the "J" and "K" keys move the cursor one spacve left or
                        right, respectively. Any other key exits this mode.

Arrow keys:             -Moves the cursor one character in the direction of the
                         arrow.

Control-D:              -Deletes the character at the current cursor position.
                        All text to the right of the cursor is shifted one
                        space to the left. If you delete all the characters in
                        the text area, it will be treated as if you deleted the
                        item. Apple 2e users can use the DELETE key and it will
                        function the same as Control-D.

Control-I:              -Inserts characters at the current cursor position. All
                        characters to the right of and including the cursor are
                        shifted one character to the right. The new character
                        is placed to the left of the cursor.

Control-R:              -Restarts the editing session with the editing session
                        with the original text. This allows you to recover
                        what you started with if you make extensive editing
                        errors.

Control-N:              -Blanks the current editing error. If you want to
                        replace everything in the editing area, it's easier to
                        start with a clean screen.

Control-B:              -Moves the cursor to the first character in the area
                        currently being edited.

Control-E:              -Moves the cursor to the last character in the area
                        currently being edited.

If you are not familiar with entering control characters, it's really very
easy.  To type the CTRL-D command, hold the CTRL key down while pressing 
the "D" key.

--------------------------
ENTERING ROOM INFORMATION:
--------------------------


When you add or edit a room, you get the same display. For each room, you
can enter:

- Title of the room
- Items found in room
- Comments
- Pathways to other rooms

The first three are covered in this section.  The next section discusses
pathways.


------
TITLE:
------


The TITLE command allows the 18 character room title to be modified.  When
a room is added, the title is initially blank.  Practice using all of the
text commands now.

After entering the title, press the "L" key to return to the highest level
menu to verify that the title you entered is displayed as the selected room.


---------
COMMENTS:
---------


The COMMENTS command allows the comments area of the screen to be modified.
Notice that the comments area is located in a multiple line text editing
area.  Enter some comments and observe how the words are placed in the area.


------
ITEMS:
------


Up to eight items per room can be entered.  Each item name can be 11 
characters long.  The ITEMS command calls up one of three new menus:

- If the items area is blank:

  ADD LEAVE

- If there is at least one item, but less than eight:

  ADD EDIT DELETE LEAVE

- If there are eight items:

  EDIT DELETE LEAVE

The ADD command adds a new item to the end of the list.  The arrow keys are
used to position to a particular item.  The DELETE command deletes the
currently selected item.  The EDIT command allows the currently selected
item to be modified.

Practice adding, editing, and deleting items.

-----------------
CONNECTING ROOMS:
-----------------


The PATHWAYS command provides the mechanism to define the connections between
the rooms in your adventure.  Up to eight connections can be defined between
rooms.  The PATHWAYS command calls up one of the same three menus as the ITEMS
command.  The reasons for calling a particular menu and the basic function of
the ADD, DELETE, and LEAVE commands are the same as the ITEMS command.  The
only real difference is the information to be recorded.


---------
PATHWAYS:
---------


When you add a pathway, the cursor will go to the left side of the screen under
the word "PATHWAY".  For each connection, a fourteen character pathway can be entered to define the direction that must be taken in order to move to the 
connecting room.  Some typical examples are:

NORTH    SOUTHEAST    UP    FOLLOW PATH    GO DOOR    CLIMB TREE    LAUNCH BOAT


---------------------------
CONNECTING TO ANOTHER ROOM:
---------------------------


After you have edited your pathway and hit return, the cursor will move to the
right side of the same line under the word "ROOM".

At this point, all you have to do is enter the room number of the room you want
to connect it to.  You have just made a room connection.

What did you say?  You  don't remember the room number?  Read on.


--------------------------
SELECTING YOUR CONNECTION:
--------------------------


Instead of entering the room number, just press the "RETURN" key.  The display
will change to show the map grid.  The room you are currently editing will be
shown in a different color with the cursor around it.

Move the cursor, using the normal room cursor movement commands, to the room
you wish to connect to.  The "SELECTED" area will update to display the titles
of the rooms as you move the cursor through them.  Once your cursor is properly
positioned, press the "RETURN" key to establish the connection between the 
rooms.


-----------------
REVERSE PATHWAYS:
-----------------


So far, you have established a single direction pathway from the room you're
editing to the room you've selected.  Since most connections run both ways,
when a room is initially added, you are given the opportunity to establish the
other connection.  This feature is not implemented for the edit command.

After you have defined the connection, you will return to the room editing
display.  The second line from the bottom will display the question:

REVERSE PATHWAY?

If you hit "RETURN", a single direction pathway will be established from the
current room to the selected room.  If you want to define a two way path later,
position to the other room and define another one way path back to the room you
are now editing.

If, in response to the question, you type in a pathway, a two way path will be
defined.

For example, you can enter a path from room 1 east to room 2.  If you type
"WEST" when asked for a reverse pathway, then a path exists from room 2 west
to room 1.

It should be emphasized that establishing a path with a reverse path, is exact-
ly equivalent to establishing two one-way paths between rooms.


--------------------
PATHWAYS TO NOWHERE:
--------------------


If you do not know where a particular exit goes, you can enter a "?" as the
room number.  The room title will be shown as question marks and exit indica-
tors will be printed on the map for each pathway to nowhere.  You can enter the
correct destination later, as you get further along on your adventure.


----------------------
PATHWAY ABBREVIATIONS:
----------------------


The more common pathway directions receive special handling.  They can be 
entered as abbreviations but will be automatically expanded to their full
form for presentation.

The pathway entries that are recognized are:

    Pathway                  Abbreviation
    -------                  ------------
    NORTH                         N
    SOUTH                         S
    EAST                          E
    WEST                          W
    UP                            U
    DOWN                          D
    NORTHEAST                     NE
    NORTHWEST                     NW
    SOUTHEAST                     SE
    SOUTHWEST                     SW

Enter some of the abbreviations above as pathways to observe their automatic
expansion into their full form.

----------------------
USING YOUR DISK DRIVE:
----------------------


The data you have entered can be stored and retrieved from a data disk.  DO
NOT USE YOUR PROGRAM DISK TO STORE YOUR ADVENTURES.  The Quick-Draw Adventure
Mapper uses data disks that are the same disk format as DOS 3.3, but organized
differently.  This means that:

- Any disk initialized with standard DOS 3.3 can be used as a data disk.

- Any data previously on the disk will be lost when used with Quick-Draw
  Adventure Mapper.

- There are no files on the disk that can be recognized by any file oriented
  utility.  Therefore, a program like APPLE's FID will not operate on the
  data disks.

- Any program (such as APPLE's COPYA) that copies the entire disk can be used
  to back-up your data disks.

When you select the XTRAS command from the highest level menu, you will be
presented with the following options:

DISK   PRINT   MOVE   BOOT   NEW   RAM   LEAVE

Select DISK and the screen should display a new menu:

FILES   SLOT/DRIVE   INIT   CATALOG   LEAVE

The various menu commands are explained below.


-----------
SLOT/DRIVE:
-----------


Press the "S" key and you can change slot and drive numbers that all other
commands will operate from.  The default is set to the drive that you booted
Quick-Draw Mapper from.


-----
INIT:
-----


If you don't have an initialized disk, this is the command for you.  This 
command produces fully compatable DOS 3.3 disks.  Until you save Quick-Draw
Adventure Mapper files on it, the disk is the same as that produced by APPLE
DOS's INIT command.


--------
CATALOG:
--------


A single Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper disk can hold four different data sets.
This command will read the disk in the current slot and drive and display the
titles of the four files.  Missing files are displayed as blanks.  The titles
are displayed under the "FILE TITLE" heading on the screen.


------
FILES:
------


A disk catalog is performed and a new menu is called up with the following
functions:

SAVE   RESTORE   PRUGE   LEAVE

When you press the "S" key to begin the SAVE command, the disk's catalog will
will be displayed and a flashing indicator will be placed in the left most
column of the title display area.  You can use the arrow keys to position the 
indicator.

If the position you selected already has a file title, your current data will
be stored in that position under the same name.  If the position is blank, a
cursor will appear next to the indicator and you will have to enter a file
title.  Make the title discriptive, since it will be used when the maps and
information summaries are printed.

The RESTORE command lets you select a file to bring back into memory.  If you
pick an empty file, the current memory is preserved.

The PURGE command erases a file on the disk, so that you can use the space to
save a different adventure under a new title.

PRINTING MAPS AND SUMMARIES:
----------------------------


Selecting the PRINT command from the XTRAS menu will call up a new menu:

ALL   MAP   SUMMARY   CHANGED   OPTIONS   LEAVES

Use these commands to print maps and summaries of your adventure:

   Command                      Action
   -------                      ------
   ALL                          Prints a map and summary of the current 
                                   adventure.
   MAP                          Prints the map only.
   SUMMARY                      Prints the summary only.
   CHANGED                      Prints the summary only for the rooms that have
                                   been added or changed since the last boot,
                                   NEW command, or RESTORE command.
   OPTIONS                      Sets options that control the appearance of the
                                   printed map.


------------
MAP OPTIONS:
------------


Selecting the OPTIONS command from the PRINT menu calls up still another menu:

NUMS   TITLES   BOTH   SHOW   OMIT   1   2   LEAVE

These commands control the map printing options and can be set in the
configuration program:

Command         Action
-------         ------
 NUMS           Only the room numbers are printed
TITLES          Only the titles are printed
 BOTH           Both the room numbers and the titles are printed
 SHOW           The entry/exit path indicators, explained below, are shown on
                the map.
 OMIT           The entry/exit indicators are removed from the map
  1             Prints the map in single density graphics
  2             Prints the map in double density graphics (not available on all
                printers)

The entry/exit indicators let you see which paths enter and exit a room. A path
leaving a room has a small line drawn perpendicular to it on the outside of the
box representing the room. The line is drawn inside the box if the path enters
the room. If a path enters and exits a room, BOTH lines are drawn.

You should print out maps using the various combinations to determine your own
individual preference.

------------------
REARRANGING ROOMS:
------------------


From the XTRAS menu, the MOVE command will display the current adventure map on
the screen and present one of the following menus:

PICKUP   INSERT   DELETE   LEAVE

            -or-

INSERT   DELETE   LEAVE

The first menu is presented when the cursor is positioned on an existing room.
The second menu, without the PICKUP command is used when the cursor is
positioned to an empty spot.

PICKUP:
-------


The room located at the current cursor position changes color.  Move the
cursor to the new location for that room.  When you press the "RETURN" key,
the room at the old position will disappear, and reappear at the current
location of the cursor.  Obviously, you cannot move a room to a location that
is currently occupied by another room.


------------------
INSERT AND DELETE:
------------------


These commands allow you to move many rooms at one time.  Selecting one of
them indicates whether you want to insert or delete space and brings up the
following menu:

ROW   COLUMN   HORZ.   VERTICAL   LEAVE

These commands will move the existing rooms as explained below.  None of the
commands will allow you to shift rooms off of the map.  You should practice
the room moving commands until you are comfortable using them.


---------------
INSERT DETAILS:
---------------


Command         Action
-------         ------
ROW             Consider a square whose upper corner is the cursor and whose
                lower right corner is the lower right corner of the screen.
                The ROW command will move that square down one row.  The ROW
                command will not work if the bottom row of the square contains
                any rooms.

COLUMN          Consider the same square.  The column command will shift it one
                column to the right.  It will not work if the right column of
                the square contains any rooms.

HORZ.           All rooms in the same row as the cursor that are at or to the
                right of the cursor position are shifted one column to the
                right.  There cannot be a room in the rightmost position of
                cursor row.

VERTICAL        All rooms at or below the cursor position that are in the same
                column as the cursor are shifted down one row. There can not be
                a room at the bottom of the cursor row.


---------------
DELETE DETAILS:
---------------


Command         Action
-------         ------
ROW             Imagine a square whose upper left corner is the cursor and
                whose lower right corner is the lower right corner of the
                screen. The ROW command will move that square up one row.
                The ROW command will not work if the top row of the square
                contains any rooms.

COLUMN          Consider the same square as mentioned above. The COLUMN command
                will shift it one column to the left. It will not work if the
                left column of the square contains any rooms.

HORZ.           All rooms in the same row as the cursor that are at the right
                or to the right of the cursor are shifted one column to the
                left. There cannot be a room in the same position as the
                cursor.

VERTICAL        All rooms at or below the cursor that are in the same column as
                the cursor are shifted up one row. There cannot be a room in
                the same position as the cursor.

OTHER COMMANDS:
---------------


From the XTRAS menu, there are three additional commands:

RAM

The number of bytes of memory left is displayed.

NEW

Clears memory so that you can begin with a clean slate.

BOOT

The computer will be rebooted from the drive that Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper
was loaded from.

SPECIFYING INTERFACE CARD DATA:
-------------------------------


If you have a printer interface card that is not currently supported, you have
three options:

[01]  Buy a supported card.  (Not a popular choice).

[02]  Write your own interface driver.  (Explained in the next section).

[03]  Specify certain parameters about your interface.  (Explained below).

During configuration, select the "USER-SPECIFIED" option for your interface and
answer affirmatively when asked if you want to specify your interface 
parameters.

You need to know the following information which should be in the manual for
your interface card:

   Data Address - This is the address at which each byte must be stored in
                  order to transmit it to the printer.

   Busy Address - This is the address that contains the printer busy status.

   Busy Bit - This is the bit number in the busy address that must be tested
              to determine if the printer is busy.  The low order bit is 0 and
              and the high order bit is 7.

   Set/Reset - Set means that if the bit is on, the printer is busy.  Reset
               means that if the bit is off, the printer is busy.

   Strobe On Address - This is an address that must be toggled after the data
                       byte has been stored in order to transfer the data.  It
                       is not required on most interfaces.

   Strobe Off Address - This address is required on some interfaces and must be
                        toggled after the strobe on address.

Addresses can be entered as decimal (default) or hexadecimal (preceded with a
"$") values.  You can enter absolute addresses set for a specific slot or make
them adjust to the slot number (s) entered during configuration.  After
specifying each address, you will have to select one of five address
modifications:

- None
- Slot *16
- Slot *256
- 2nd Slot *16
- 2nd Slot *256


----------------------------
WRITING AN INTERFACE DRIVER:
----------------------------


If you can program in 6502 assembly language, you can write your own interface
driver. The rules are very simple:

- Your routine must begin at $4300 and be no longer than $0100 (256) bytes.

- The printer drivers JSR to $4300 with the character to be output in the
  accumulator.

- Name your routine "USER-WRITTEN.IF" and select "USER-WRITTEN" from the
  interface menu during configuration.

- The printer slot # is stored at $CE. The 2nd slot value is stored at $CF.

- You can use the page zero locations between $90 and $9F.


-------------------------
WRITING A PRINTER DRIVER:
-------------------------


Writing a printer driver is considerably harder. The following requirements
should be met:

- The driver must begin at $4000 and be no more than $300 (768) bytes long.

- To be general purpose, it should call an interface driver at $4300 to output
  each character.

- Mapper calls 5 different subroutines:

   > JSR $4000 to perform a normal form feed operation on the printer.

   > JSR $4003 to output a normal text line. The data begins at $2C00. Output
     80 bytes maximum or until a carriage return ($D) is found.

   > JSR $4006 to enter graphics mode. You can do whatever is required to init-
     alize the printer. All subsequent calls will be to output graphic lines
     until a leave graphics mode call is made. The line spacing must be 7
     "dots" high.

   > JSR $4009 to send a line of graphics data. The data is at $2A00 and
     consists of 480 bytes with each byte containing a column that is 7 "dots"
     high and one "dot" wide. The high order bit is always off, the 2nd highest
     is the top bit in the column, the low order bit is the bottom.

   > JSR $400C to leave graphics mode. You should do all of the "clean-up" that
     is required.

- You can use the space between $2000 and $27BF while in graphics mode. The
  contents will be indeterminate when graphics mode is entered and will be
  destroyed after graphics mode is exited. In between, it will be stable and
  survive between graphic line calls.

- Name your routine "USER-WRITTEN.PR" and select "USER-WRITTEN" from the
  printer selection menu during configuration.

- You can use the page zero locations between $80 and $8F.

- The graphics density value is stored at location $4B. A zero indicates single
  density, while a one means double density.
