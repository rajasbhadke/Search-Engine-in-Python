Anarchy is Freedom!

The anarcho-syndicalists seek to realize an autonomous society -
a society without authorities. Autonomy in all ways of life is
the basic idea of the anarcho-syndicalism.

Thus they refuse the organization of their interests by centralistically
structured institutions. Such institutions always use hierarchy and the
imbalanced concentration of power. Nor shall or could anyone realize
their interests through representatives, such as are maintained in
reformist unions, political parties, or religious formations based
upon congregations, dioceses or synods.

The directly and indirectly on payment-dependant individuals aim at the
ability to organize themselves in independant corporation-, subject related
and regional groups. As they are funded nationwide (Germany) by the FAU
(Freie ArbeiterInnen Union) and worldwide by the IAA.

In order to achieve their aims, they use direct actions: boycotts,
strikes, general protests, blockades, etc. They reject any parliamentary
work. In this kind of actions they see the possibility to contend
individualistic movements and the lack of perspectives.

The power of the capitalistic system resides in private and
governmental authority over production capabilites, and the daily
underpayment of the working class. Because of that, the economic area
is the primary focus of the struggle against capitalism.

Revolutionary work in the corporations hits capitalism not only in its
various appearances but also at its root. This work can only succeeed
when it is being done simultaneously in all parts of society,
because all efforts are dependant upon each other.

We welcome all people who are ready to cooperate with us in this struggle.
