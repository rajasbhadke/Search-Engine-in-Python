 INFOCOM'S ENCHANTER I.

FROM THE FORK IN THE ROAD GO:

NE, N, OPEN OVEN, GET BREAD, GET JUG AND LANTERN, S, E, SE, NE, DRINK WATER,
GET WATER, SW, SE, SW, SW, S

---> AN OLD HAG WILL GIVE YOU A SCROLL. THROUGHOUT THE GAME, YOU WILL BE FINDING
     THESE SPELL SCROLLS. SOME SPELLS YOU WILL NEVER NEED. SOME YOU MAY NEED TO
     USE MORE THAN ONCE. YOU MUST WRITE THE ONES YOU NEED TO USE MORE THAN ONCE
     IN YOUR SPELL BOOK. 'FWEEP' IS ONE OF THESE, SO:

READ SCROLL, GNUSTO FWEEP, NE, NE, E, E, MEMORIZE FWEEP, FWEEP THE GATE, E

---> YOU HAVE REACHED THE CASTLE. WHEN- EVER YOU FEEL HUNGRY OR THIRSTY, DRINK
     THE WATER OR EAT THE BREAD. NOW DO THE FOLLOWING:

READ BOOK, MEMORIZE FROTZ, FROTZ THE LAMP, S, S, E, S, OPEN DOOR, N, READ
WRITING, REMOVE BLOCK, E, GET SCROLL, READ SCROLL, GNUSTO EXEX, W, S, U, DROP
ALL, E, GET LIGHTED PORTRAIT, GET SCROLL, W, GET ALL, READ SCROLL, GNUSTO OZMOO,
N, N, E, MEMORIZE OZMOO, E, OZMOO ME, (WAIT FOR A COUPLE OF TURNS BY TYPING 'L'
OR 'I')

---> YOU WILL NOW BE SACRIFICED, BUT THE OZMOO SPELL WILL KEEP YOU ALIVE!
     NOW THEN:


D, OPEN SOUTH DOOR, S, GET ALL, N, W, W, S, CUT ROPE WITH DAGGER, OPEN BOX, GET
SCROLL, READ SCROLL, MELBOR ME, S, W, U, GET IN BED, SLEEP.

---> YOU HAVE NOW PROTECTED YOURSELF (TO A DEGREE) AGAINST THE POWERFUL MAGIC OF
     KRILL. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO AT LEAST FACE HIM AND USE THE POWERFUL KULCAD
     SPELL... BUT MORE OF THAT LATER. AT THE MOMENT, YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO
     THE DREAM YOU HAVE. NOTICE THE PRINESS WHO SEEMS TO HIDE A SCROLL IN THE
     BEDPOST. WELL, WHEN YOU WAKE UP, YOU SHOULD TRY THE FOLLOWING:

GET OUT OF BED, EXAMINE BEDPOST, PUSH BUTTON, GET SCROLL, READ SCROLL, GNUSTO
VAXUM, D, E, E, E, S, SE, MEMORIZE NITFOL, NITFOL TURTLE, MEMORIZE EXEX, EXEX
TURTLE

---> NOW YOU HAVE ONE FAST MOVING TURTLE ON YOUR HANDS! BY THE WAY, IF YOU EVER
     GET SLEEPY FROM HERE ON, JUST SAY "SLEEP". OK, NOW YOU WANT THE TURTLE TO
     FOLLOW YOU, SO SAY

"TURTLE, FOLLOW ME", NW, N, E, U,

---> NOW YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE TURTLE THE FOLLOWING STRING OF COMMANDS AT ONCE...

 "TURTLE, SE, GET SCROLL, NW"

---> YOU'VE GOT THE KULCAD SPELL!

GET SCROLL, "TURTLE, STAY", D, W, N, N, N, N, FOLLOW TRACKS, REACH IN
HOLE, READ FRAYED SCROLL, N, MEMORIZE FWEEP, FWEEP THE GATE, N, GET SCROLL, READ
CRUMPLED SCROLL, S, W, W, W, W, W, U, MEMORIZE FWEEP, FWEEP THE EGG, KREBF
SHREDDED SCROLL, GET SCROLL, D, MEMORIZE VAXUM, E

--> OK, NOW YOU SHOULD MESS AROUND IN THE HALLS OF MIRRORS UNTIL YOU SEE THE
    ZORKING ADVENTURER. YOU SHOULD THEN:

ZIFMIA THE ADVENTURER, VAXUM ADVENTURER, SHOW THE DAGGER TO THE ADVENTURER, (GO
EAST UNTIL YOU ARE IN THE GUARDED ROOM), POINT AT THE DOOR, N, "DROP ALL BUT
BREAD, JUG AND LAMP", GET MAP AND PENCIL, S, CLOSE DOOR.

---> IT IS >VERY< IMPORTANT THAT THE THE ADVENTURER DOES NOT TAKE YOUR SPELL
     BOOK OR YOUR BRITTLE SCROLL OR YOUR FRAYED SCROLL. IF HE HAS, YOU MUST
     RESTART THE GAME AT THE LAST SAVED GAME (YOU HAVE BEEN PERIODICALLY SAVING
     THE GAME, HAVEN'T YOU?) AND MAKE SURE YOU CLOSE THE DOOR TO THE ROOM SO HE
     DOESN'T GET THOSE THREE ITEMS WHILE YOU ARE OFF DEFEATING THE GREAT
     TERROR!!

---> NOW THEN, IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP, YOU WILL NOTICE THAT IT MAPS THE STRANGE
     TRANSLUCENT ROOMS YOU FIND BELOW THE DUNGEON. IF YOU NOTICED THE TUNNELS
     CONNECTING THE ROOMS DOWN THERE, THEY WERE PERFECTLY ROUND AND MADE OF
     CARBON. WELL, THIS MAGIC MAP CAN MAKE AND ERASE THESE MAGIC TUNNELS JUST BY
     DRAWING AND ERASING LINES ON THE MAP!! BUT YOU ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF LINES
     WORTH OF PENCIL LEFT, SO YOU HAVE TO USE IT WISELY! THE SCROLL YOU NEED TO
     DEFEAT KRILL LIES IN THE ROOM MARKED P.... BUT SO DOES THE ULTIMATE EVIL
     TERROR, WHO IS GUARDING IT. THE IDEA IS TO RELEASE THIS TERROR BY CREATING
     A TUNNEL TO P, BUT TO TRAP THE TERROR IN OTHER ROOMS BEFORE IT GETS A
     CHANCE TO ESCAPE THE TRANSLUCENT ROOMS AND JOIN FORCES WITH KRILL! FIRST,
     GET DOWN TO THE FIRST ROOM BELOW THE DUNGEON...

W, W, W, W, W, W, S, S, S, S, E, S, D,

---> NOW TO TRICK THE TERROR!

S, E, NE, SE, CONNECT F AND P, SW, SW, GET SCROLL, ERASE B AND R, ERASE V AND M,
NE, NW, NW, CONNECT B AND J, W, READ POWERFUL SCROLL, U, U, E, E, N, N, N, N, N,
E, OPEN DOOR, N, DROP MAP AND PENCIL, GET ALL BUT MAP AND PENCIL, S, W, S, S, E,
E

---> NOW TO UNDO KRILL'S MAGIC STAIRS AND GET THE BASTARD!

MEMORIZE VAXUM, KULCAD STAIR, READ ORNATE SCROLL, IZYUK ME, E, GONDAR DRAGON,
VAXUM BEING, GUNCHO KRILL

**** YOU'VE DONE IT!!!!!!!! ****
