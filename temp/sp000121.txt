***** 9th June / Tokyo, Kyoto ****************************************
The wedding ceremony of "Prince Naruhito".  The Japanese state made a
campaign to force people to celebrate this wedding and the imperial
family.  Many actions were undertaken by anarchists, communists and
citizen groups.  There was a demo in metropole Tokyo.  In Kyoto, radical
students occupied University campuses, held self-lectures, and took
direct action to hinder the institutional hoisting of the so called
"National Flag" (Hino-Maru).  That afternoon, anarchists and radicals
joined a meeting organized by a women's group and held a rally.  The march
went through the main streets of town.  "BETTER DEAD THAN WED!!!"


***** 6-15th June / Kyoto  ********************************************
Demonstrations against "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty".  Radical students
(including anarchist students) held a 10km rally.  They met another demo
and meeting organized by citizen groups.  Riot police reacted violently,
but people linked arms giving no opportunity for cops to make arrests.  

***** 4-11th July /Tokyo, Kyoto, etc. *********************************
Actions against the G-7 Tokyo summit at many places:
-Tokyo; Radical students and anarchist student groups hold 
       rally at the city which was under heavy police guard.
-Kyoto; A rally organized by citizen and leftist groups.
-Osaka; Activists held the "People's Counter-Summit."

***** 11th July / Tokyo ***********************************************
Protest rally and meeting against racism.  The Tokyo city government
and the police closed Totoki Park which many foreigners, mainly Iranians
were using and arrested them for "illegal staying."  Most of them were
deported.  The demo started from Shibuya.  Punk music was heard from the
megaphone protected by the anarco-punks' "hard-core bloc."  Although cops
tried to prevent people from joining they could do nothing against the
hundreds of foreigners who gathered and filled up the square in front of
Harajuka station where the march reached.  People chanted "Police Go
Home!  Smash Fascism!"  By-passing foreigners made speech and condemned
the racist policy of the Japanese state.  

****** 17 -18th July / Kyoto  *******************************************
Regional activists from the anti-Emperor movement gathered to discuss
the further direction of struggle.
