THE SCENARIO: DEVICE ZX88B - mistakenly activated during a moment of feverish
international tensions- is about to trigger twenty DOOMSDAY Bombs from a series
of enemy satelites encircling the Earth! The world holds it's breath as you are
assigned to disarm the device before it detonates the bombs.

Device ZX88B is a sophisticated failsafe system designed to resist tampering.
It can't be turned off. It can't be destroyed. The twelve microchips within it
are designed to send detonation pulses to the enemy satelite network within
minutes of activation. The source of these pulses is the microfuse built into
each of the twelve microchips.

Game Play:

Motherboard: The Motherboard within DEVICE ZX88B represents all twelve
microchips and shows you which are available for entry at any given time. Enter
a microchip by typing it's number. As long as the game lasts, you will always
have a choice of at least two microchips to enter. The game evaluates your play
on each chip,and awards a greater number of choices after a well played screen.
If a chip defeats you, you may choose to re-enter it immediately, or re-enter
it later in the game.

Microbatteries: You must use the power stored in each of the microbatteries to
OVERLOAD, and disarm each microchip. You must go to a battery to transfer power
to each of the other two batteries on each microchip. You continue to go to a
battery and send charges to the other two until one of them becomes overloaded
and begins to flash. At this time the flashing microchip is vulnerable and so
are you. You must reach the overload without being hit. This causes the circuit
to blow. You then begin a "Lightning Run" for bonus points. The "charge" on the
overloaded battery becomes the amount of time available to you for the
lightning round.

Neutrons, Double Neutrons, and Photons: Avoid being hit by these foriegn
particles that pulsate throughout the microchip. Contact with any of them will
drain power from the batteries and alert THE DEVICE of your intrusion. FIVE
hits will cause the system to eliminate you and make micro fuse contact.

Microspark: Microsparks usually appear in dead ends and contact with them will
send a power surge throughout the circuit, further charging the batteries.

Microfuse: The microfuse is the herat of the microchip. Do not let the left and
right sides connect. If connection is made a detonation pulse will result.
Polarity on the fuse can be flipped by making contact with it, thus slowing it
down.

Lightning Run: During the lightning round you can run up your score and get
revenge on the neutrons and photons by running over as many of them as you can.

Lightning: During the lightning round the spark becomes lightning and acts as a
point multiplier. Each time you contact it point values for the neutrons and
photons double.

Vacuum: The vacuum roams the wires of the microchip during the lightning round.
Contact with it will bring the lightning round to an end.

The Twelve Micro-chips:

1)  Bouncing Neutrons- slow
2)  Quicker Neutrons- medium fast
3)  Neutron Chambers- normal
4)  Photon Chamber- Beware of the flashing electron guns that fire Photons.
5)  Chamber Maze- Travel through the walls of the maze instead of the wires.
6)  Double Cross Chamber-Where you enter determines if you travel in the walls
    or in the wires.
7)  Magnetic Chamber-The walls draw you from side to side, changing without
    warning.
8)  High Speed Micro-chip- Batteries drain faster and microfuse makes
    contact in half the time of a normal chip.
9)  The Short Circuit- Short circuit moves quickly, timing is crucial to jump
    through it.
A)  Photon Wire Maze- Beware of the One Way wires.
B)  Photon Walls- Combine all your talents to jump wires and move through the
    chamber walls.
C)  Photon Diamonds- Manuver the diamond maze and skillfully jump through the
    short circuit.
