        Loading/Running P.L.Editor

If you own an Apple II Plus system that
 does not have an Integer BASIC Firmware
 card, the Program Line Editor will not
be run when the supplied disk is booted.
 This is because the Greeting program is
 an Integer BASIC program. So, the follo
wing steps must be taken in order to all
ow the Program Line Editor disk to boot
properly in Applesoft.

      1. Remove the Write Protect tabs
from the edge of the included disk.
      2. Insert and boot the disk.
      3. UNLOCK PROGRAM LINE EDITOR
      4. UNLOCK PLE.FP
      5. RENAME PROGRAM LINE EDITOR,
          PLE.INT
      6. RENAME PLE.FP.PROGRAM LINE
          EDITOR
      7. LOCK PROGRAM LINE EDITOR
      8. LOCK PLE.INT
      9. Replace the Write Protect tab.
     10. Reboot the disk

After this is done,just boot the disk n
ormally. Soon, a disk catalog will appea
r,letting you know the PLE is up and run
ning.

When the PLE has been run,you shouldn't
 notice anything unusual about the opera
tion of your Apple. In,fact, everything
IS the same, except for all of the new c
ommands and features described in the fo
llowing pages.

NOTE: When the PLE is up and running, D
OS will set HI-MEM:1536 bytes lower than
 normal for your system.

PAGE 1

There are two new commands added to BAS
IC that allow you to edit either a progr
am line or the last line of characters t
yped at the keyboard. These are CTRL-E (
EDIT) and CTRL-W

        ENTERING EDIT MODE:
            CTRL-E AND CTRL-W


This is the command used when you want
to edit a line in your program. To type
Ctrl-E, just press the CTRL key and hold
 it down while you hit the E key.After t
he word "EDIT" appears, type the line nu
mber of the line you want to edit. The l
ine will appear,with the cursor at the b
eginning of the first statement in the l
ine. The Line Editor remembers the numbe
r of the last line edited, so, if you wa
nt to edit the same line again later, si
mply type Ctrl-E and a period (.). This
will cause the last - edited line to rea
ppear.


Here are a few things to watch for when
 using Crtl-E to enter Edit mode:

1. Ctrl-E must be the first character t
yped on a line.
2. Don't try to edit line 0 of an Apple
soft program.
3. Ctrl-E is disabled during INPUTs and
 Monitor.
4. Backspacing into the word EDIT befor
e typing the line number may disable Ctr
l-R (RESTART) in Edit mode.
5. If you inadvertently type the ESCape
 key before typing Ctrl-E, two warning b
ells will sound and you will not enter E
dit mode. If a line number is typed afte
r the warning bell, hitting Return may d
elete the line.
6. If a line is longer than the maximum
 BASIC line length (128 for Integer BASI
C, 239 for Applesoft), it will be auto-P
ACKed, removing all extraneous spaces fr
om the line.



              CTRL-W

This is the command to use when you hav
e typed a line in Integer BASIC and rece
ived a ***SYNTAX ERROR message. Just typ
e Ctrl-W and the line will instantly rea
ppear. Ctrl-W works during INPUTs, and i
t will recover and re-execute immediate
commands. This command can also be used
to recover lines canceled with Ctrl-X.

Ctrl-W actually works two ways, dependi
ng on when it is typed. If it is typed a
s the first character on a line, it will
 cause the last line typed from the keyb
oard to reappear. If it is typed while e
ntering a line, ctrl-W retypes the line
and  enters Edit mode.

Here are some things to be careful of w
hen using Ctrl-W:

1. Ctrl-W does NOT work when entered as
 the first character of an Applesoft lin
e.
2. Very long lines may be auto-PACKed,
removing all extraneous spaces.



         EDIT MODE:CONTROL COMMANDS


All of the following commands are avail
able only after entering Edit mode as de
scribed. Control characters in the edite
d line are displayed in inverse video du
ring Edit mode. A warning bell will soun
d if your line has reached the maximum B
ASIC line length (128 for Integer BASIC,
239 lines for Applesoft).

Notice the first character of each comm
and's name is the same as (or sounds lik
e) the command itself. This is an easy w
ay to remember these commands.


              EDIT MODE COMMANDS


Ctrl-I INSERT -This command allows you
to insert character into the line. Non-c
ontrol characters typed after a Ctrl-I w
ill be inserted in front of the cursor,
and the rest of the line will spread to
make room. All following characters type
d will be inserted until a control chara
cter is typed (such as <-,->, or another
 Edit mode command). To insert control c
haracters, see OVERRIDE.


Ctrl-D DELETE -To delete the character
under the cursor from the line, type ctr
l-D. The character will disappear, and t
he rest of the line will move in and fil
l up the space created. If you DELETE to
o much, you can recover the line with RE
START

Ctrl-F  FIND -Followed by a character t
yped N times, FIND will move the cursor
to the Nth occurrence of the character i
n the line. For example, to position the
 cursor on the third colon (:) in a line
, type Ctrl-F :::. Notice that you only
need type Ctrl-F once. Type any other ch
aracter to terminate FIND


Ctrl-Z ZAP - This function deletes all
characters up to a specific character. A
 Ctrl-Z followed by a character typed N
times will delete all characters up to t
he Nth occurrence of that character (muc
h like FIND). For example, to delete thr
ee statements from a line, type Ctrl-Z :
::. Type any other character to terminat
e ZAP. If you ZAP a little too far, you
can restore the original line with RESTA
RT

Ctrl-0  OVERRIDE  - This command functi
ons exactly like the INSERT command exce
pt that the FIRST character inserted may
 be a control character. After the first
 character has been inserted, OVERRIDE b
ehaves exactly like INSERT that is, inse
rtion is terminated with a control chara
cter. Inserted control characters are di
splayed in inverse video in Edit mode. Y
ou can use OVERRIDE  to insert Ctrl-D's
into PRINT  statements for DOS commands.
 You might also want to experiment with
other control characters such as the fou
r programmable cursor characters (Ctrl-
H,I,J,K),backspaces,and carriage returns
.

Ctrl-R  RESTART- The RESTART command is
 used to re-edit the original line, rega
rdless of any changes or deletions you m
ight have made (A life saver). RESTART d
oes not work if you entered Edit mode wi
th a Ctrl-W.

Ctrl-P PACK-The PACK command allows you
 to remove extraneous spaces in edited l
ines that would otherwise cause a *** TO
O LONG error. Ctrl-P will retype a line
with all spaces removed except those wit
hin quotes. PACK can also be used when y
ou hear the bell warning you that your l
ine is too long. To protect REMark lines
 from being PACKed, enter a quote as the
 first character of the REMark.


Ctrl-C  CONVERT  -  The CONVERT command
 is used to quickly convert upper case t
ext to lower case, or vice versa. ctrl-C
 converts the character under the cursor
 to the current case set by the Crtl-A/C
trl-S upper-lower shift lock, and advanc
es the cursor.

Ctrl-B  BEGIN  -  This command moves th
e cursor to the beginning of the line.
It is useful for repositioning the curso
r before using the FIND command, and for
 renumbering lines.


Ctrl-N  END  -  This command moves the
cursor to the end of the line.Ctrl-Q  QU
IT  - The QUIT command deletes to the en
d of the line starting from the cursor p
osition and exits Edit mode. The line is
 entered up to the cursor position.

Ctrl-M  RETURN - Typing a Carriage RETU
RN will exit Edit mode and save the line
 exactly as it appears on the screen  Th
is is the usual way of leaving Edit mode
.

Ctrl-X  CANCEL -  Ctrl-X is used to can
cel the line being edited, and exit Edit
 mode. A line cancelled with Ctrl-X can
be recovered with Ctrl-W.

<-,->    The backward and forward arrow
 keys work just as they normally do, mov
ing the cursor backward or forward one s
pace. These are also invoked with Ctrl-H
 and Ctrl-U, respectively.


Ctrl-A,Ctrl-S - The upper and lower cas
e shift lock keys also work in Edit mode
. Ctrl-A is upper shift lock,and Ctrl-S
is the lower shift lock. (See CONVERT)

STOP LIST
    ESC or
    Ctrl-S   Temporarily stop,i.e. pro
              gram listings or CATALOG,
              hit Ctrl-S or ESC. Exit
              command, hit any key.


CANCEL LIST
    CTRL-C   To terminate listing
              entirely and return to BAS
IC

FLUSH LIST
   Ctrl-F    To quickly skip through
              long listings. To resume
              output to screen Ctrl-F

NOTICE: ECS and Ctrl-S:

        During INPUT be careful. The ab
ove commands S,C,F,ESC, work ONLY when c
haracters are actually being printed on
the screen.




              CURSOR CONTROL

Ctrl-H  -  LEFT
Ctrl-I  -  RIGHT
Ctrl-J  -  DOWN
Ctrl-K  -  UP

These character allow you to control th
e position of the cursor from within PRI
NT,REM, or INPUT statements.

Example: a PRINT statement with an aste
risk followed by five Ctrl-K's and anoth
er asterisk will print an asterisk one s
pace ahead and four lines above the othe
r.



            ESCAPE FUNCTIONS

NOTE: THE ESCAPE FUNCTIONS ARE NOT AVAI
LABLE DURING EDIT MODE !!!!


ESC @, A-G   These are normal Apple Esc
ape commands. They work as is in manual.

ESC P  Typing ESC-P/ same as ESC shift-
P, except don't use shift key.

ESC I,HJ,K,M   Simulate Autostart ROM E
scape editing. Same as ESC A,B,C,D,


ESC T   This types TEXT and RETURN, and
 then POKE -16300,0 RETURN, which return
s you to text page 1.

ESC L   Type LIST and a carriage return
.


ESC O  Automatically types CALL-936

ESC 1,2   ESC 1 will CATALOG the disk
        in drive 1
          ESC 2 will CATALOG the disk
        in drive 2

ESC /  Use in place of word PRINT


ESC:   This does a CALL-151 Note that a
  ":" is a lower case "*" the Monitor pr
ompt character.When executed all that is
 seen is "MON"


ESC <- ->  Performs eight <- and -> . T
yping ESC ->->->->-> will copy an entire
 line from the Apple screen while ESC <-
<- will fast backspace sixteen times.

ESC Q  This function will bring the  va
lue of the contents of any two memory lo
cations. To use, you must first set the
variable A equal to the address of the l
ocation of the two-byte number. (This is
 done by typing A=n, where n is an integ
er) Next just type ESC Q. This function
is roughly equivalent to PRINT PEEK (A)
+ PEEK (A+1) * 256, except that values g
reater that 32767 are printed as negativ
e numbers.  In INTEGER BASIC setting A=7
4 will print the current value of LOMEM:
 and A=76 will print the address of HIME
M: In Applesoft use A=105 and A=73 respe
ctively, to print the value of LOMEM: an
d HIMEM: This function is not printed on
 the screen during execution.



ESC W- Will calculate the start address
 and length of the most recently BLOADed
 disk file on 48K system.  You must chan
ge the constants within the function wit
h the ESC CREATE programs for use with o
ther size systems.

ESC !-% -ESC shift 1 thru ESC shift 5
make available the five characters that
 are not normally available on the Apple
 keyboard: the right bracket ( ) the bac
kslash (  ) the underline ( ) Ctrl-/ and
 ctrl

ESCAPE FUNCTIONS CAN BE USED FOR ANYTHI
NG, REMEMBER POKES PEEKS CALLS, TYPE RES
PONSES TO INPUT, FIRE UP PRINTER DRIVER,
 APPEND INTEGER BASIC.




 ESCAPE CREATE.INT
 ESCAPE CREATE.FP

When using the ESC CREATE program to di
splay the Escape functions you've notice
d that the cursor movement commands ESC`
@ through ESC F are defined in terms of
themselves.

If you don't want the text of the Escap
e function to be displayed on the Apple
screen just insert (') apostrophe into t
he function at the place where you want
to disable the display (usually the firs
t character of the function). When encou
ntered, during execution of an ESC funct
ion, listing of the function is turned o
ff and (') skipped over NOT entered into
 the line as part of the function.


Also notice ESC Ctrl-E is defined as tw
o bells and a Ctrl-X. This can be a life
saver if you use ESC key for Stop List a
nd you accidentally hit the ESC key afte
r the listing has stopped.  The next key
 will be processed as an Escape function
 and thus you will NOT enter Edit mode.
Type Ctrl-E to enter Edit mode and you h
ear two bell, you know to try again.



USING PLE GREETING PROGRAM ON YOUR OWN
DISK::

A. Insert PLE disk and boot.
B. Decide Integer BASIC or Applesoft of
 the greeting program you want.
C. LOAD PLE
D. Insert your own disk.
E. CATALOG your disk to find out the na
me and file type of its existing greetin
g program.
F. SAVE HELLO. You now have replaced th
e old greeting program with PLE


GREETING PROGRAMS:

A. LOAD PLE
B. DEL 10,30
C. ENTER YOUR PROGRAM.
     INTEGER: The last statements execu
ted in your program MUST

     GOSUB 32767: PRINT  "<ctrl-D>INT"
    Applesoft: the last statement execut
ed must be

     GOSUB 63999:PRINT "<ctrl-D>FP"

Because the final INT and FP immediatel
y terminates the program and clears prog
ram memory, it is NOT possible to RUN an
other program from your Greeting program
. BRUN CATALOG AND EXEC etc., are allowe
d

D. Insert your own disk.
E. Save HELLO

It is possible to INIT a new disk with
a PLE Greeting program.



ENTERING BASIC FROM APPLE MONITOR

To return to BASIC after hitting RESET
or CALL-151,type Ctrl-Y and hit return.
If you use 3D0G to re-enter BASIC the PL
E will be disabled until BASIC is reente
red with Ctrl-Y. If you have Autostart R
OM, hitting RESET  will always return yo
u to BASIC with the Editor up and runnin
g.

THE PLE IS MUCH CONNECTED TO THE APPLE
LIKE A PRINTER OR OTHER PERIPHERAL.
THEREFORE WHEN YOU USE PR# IN# THE PLE
IS TEMPORARILY DISABLED AND MUST BE RECO
NNECTED. IN APPLESOFT CALL-1013 OR SIMPL
Y AN & IN YOUR PROGRAM OR FROM THE KEYBO
ARD. INTEGER DOESN'T HAVE & STATEMENT YO
U MUST USE CALL-1013 TO RECONNECT THE PL
E.




MEMORY CONFLICTS;
To transfer to another disk

A. BLOAD REMOVE PLE
B. BSAVE REMOVE PLE,A$300,L$3A
