About The Game:  Neon is written by the author of Roundabout
which was released two years ago.  Since then Datamost the
company that distributed that game went out of business.  The
author of Roundabout has given me Capt Copy permission to
disktribute this game for free.  Do not pay any attention to
any copyrights.  This is absolutely free and legal to distribute
to any of your friends.  Look forward to another release by the
same author soon.  I will write some docs for it in the near
future.

Object:  The object of the game is to pick up all the Neon lights
while avoiding any monsters and avoiding running into the walls.
Each level is made up of 4 mini games each with its own rules.  I
will explain each later.  All 4 games must be completed before
you can move onto the next level.


Game Controls: The game can be played on keyboard, joystick or
joyport.  The game defaults to using the keyboard.  To use
joystick just type a ctrl-j or to use the joyport use a ctrl-p.

Keyboard commands:

Note:  Only two of the four game require you to fire at the
monsters.

In order to select which game you care to play use the space bar.


Joystick Controls:  The joystick controls the direction that you
move and also will determine which direction you will fire.
Button #1 will cause you to fire a shot.

Joyport Contols:  The atari joystick works similiar to any apple
joystick.  The joystick controls direction and the button is used
to fire.  Firing is continuous.


The Four Games:  Each level is made up of 4 mini games.  Like the
game Tron, you will not know which game you choose until you
select one by hitting a button or the space bar

Game 1: This game is made up of maze littered with Neons.  You
must pick them all up and avoid running into the face.  Level 1
has only 1 face, level 2 has 2 and so on.

Game 2: This game has you in the center of 4 deadly walls.  Pick
up each Neon as it appears.  The number remaining is in the top
right hand corner of the screen.  Do not touch any of the walls
and avoid the monsters bullets.  By the way the walls will slowly
begin to close in on you as time passes.

Game 3: This game has you in the center of several enemy
creatures.  You must pick shoot all the creatures to complete the
level.  Pick up all the Neons to increase your score.

Game 4: This game has several faces that are moving around.
Shoot as few as necessary in order to get the Neons.  The more
you shoot, the faster the remaining ones move.  Don't run into
any of them and when you have all the Neons in hand run into any
corner to complete the level.  By the way there is a time limit
on this game.

After completeing all the games you will go to the next level!


Misc:

1)Ctrl-R    Restarts the Game
2)Ctrl-S    Turns on/off the sound
3)Escape    Pauses the game
