			    *** HOW TO USE DEMUFFIN ***


AS THE TITLE SAYS, IT'S CALLED DEMUFFIN PLUS.  I'M SURE ALL YOU APPLE USERS
KNOW WHAT MUFFIN IS (IT UPDATES DOS 3.2 FILES TO DOS 3.3 FILES.  DEMUFFIN PLUS
IS A MODIFICATION OF THIS PROGRAM.  WHAT IT DOES IS READ THE RESIDENT D.O.S.
(THE DOS ON THE DISK YOU WANT TO CRACK) AND 'UPDATES' IT TO STANDARD APPLE DOS
DEMUFFIN DOESN'T HAVE THE RESIDENT DOS IN MEMORY, YOU HAVE TO LOAD DEMUFFIN
PLUS AT A LOCATION WHERE IT WON'T GET MESSED UP WHEN YOU BOOT UP THE DISK YOU
WANT TO CRACK.	THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY BLOADING IT AT A$4000 OR HIGHER.  SINCE
THE PROGRAM ONLY RUNS AT LOCATION $803, YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT DOWN IN MEMORY
AFTER YOU BREAK INTO THE PROGRAM.  HERE IS A SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION ON HOW TO USE
DEMUFFIN PLUS:

1) BOOT UP DOS 3.3
2) BLOAD DEMUFFIN PLUS,A$4000
3) BOOT UP DISK YOU WANT TO CRACK
4) HIT RESET WHEN DOS HAS BOOTED UP
5) KEEP HITTING RESET UNTIL DRIVE STOPS
6) CALL-151
7) 803<4000.6000M
8) 803G
9) COPY ALL FILES ONTO 3.3 INIT'ED DISK



NOTE:  THIS WILL ONLY WORK ON A DISK THAT WHEN YOU BOOT UP, A CURSOR APPEARS .
IT WILL NOT WORK ON SOME OF THESE SOMETIMES.  SOME EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS THAT
CAN BE DEMUFFINED WITH NO OTHER CHANGES ARE:
SPACE VIKINGS
KRELL S.A.T. PREPARATION SERIES
CASTLE OF DARKNESS

AND MANY OTHERS!


DEMUFFIN PLUS WILL ALSO NOT WORK ON
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE NO DOS (THE ONES
THAT JUST LOAD INTO MEMORY).
