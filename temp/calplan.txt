                             Plan of Operations


      This plan will be used to set the guidelines for the operation
 of CALNet.

1) CALNet will operate using Zone 49.

2) CALNet will be made up of 9 Regions (at present). This may be increased
   at a future time. The Regions will be as follows:
    
   a) San Francisco Bay Region
   b) North Coast Region
   c) Northern California Region
   d) Central Coast Region
   e) Sacramento Valley Region
   f) Central Valley Region
   g) Los Angeles Region
   h) San Diego Region
   i) Southern California Region

3) NET COORDINATOR node numbers will be the area codes used in each
   Region. In large metropolitan areas HUBS will be used to supplement
   NETS

4) The stated purpose of CALNet is to allow BBS operators within the
   state of California to share information that is of interest to 
   themselves and their users. Information that is not necessarily
   of interest to systems or users outside of the state of California.

5) No member of CALNet will be required to drop any existing
   affilation in any other Network, as a matter of fact it is
   encouraged.
