Pertaining :congratulations

you negative file sufficiently pissed me off.  why don't you get a life or
something...but if you wanna just keep starting up with us then do it somewhere
where i can't see it....and the placing of shit in files is equal and
rtt-able to rags on crack pages.  what I don't understand is why you had to
gnd do an asshole thing like that.

The thing that confused me is that I didn't rag on USA at all. Just a quick
mention of the times when he claimed to be in MPG.
