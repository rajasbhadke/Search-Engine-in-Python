 Well, to add fire to the flame, a backdoor in Hermes has been found.
The following contains the instructions on how to 'open' this back door
, with some important info left out in order to protect against would-be
hackers.
 
TO BECOME A SYSOP ON ANY HERMES BBS DO THE FOLLOWING: (v1.7->2.0)
     1> Logon as a new user, with the name Frank Price III.
          Phone number: 213-xxx-xxxx
[PAUSE]                 password: //xxxxxx
          (ALL OTHER INFO DOESN'T MATTER..computer type,DOB,ect.)
 
2> At the main menu type //OPENTEMP
 
3> Now the bbs will freeze up for 10-15 secs,while it loads the official Frank
Price account. Then you ll see the regular hermes prompt dissappear. Now you
can do whatever you like, because your now the sysop of that bbs. If you have
no idea what to do just type '//?', and you'll get a list of all the remote
sysop commands including a new option called '//XAMIN'. This command will let
you delete, restore, or edit the userlist. You will also see an option that
will let you d/l the Hermes Shared file. ('//DSHARE')
 
4> If you try this and it doesn't work, just be patient....When I 1st
discovered the above info, it t ook me about 10-15mins to get it to work.
 
NOTE: AT RANDOM WHEN TRYING THE ABOVE SOMETIMES THE BBS WILL HANG YOU UP
(THE ABOVE INFO HAS BEEN PROVEN ACCURATE ON AT LEAST A DOZEN HERMES BBS's)
 
 
For those that want the x'd out info, I will not give it out.


Whoever digs up the x'd out info from Hermes' bowels,
