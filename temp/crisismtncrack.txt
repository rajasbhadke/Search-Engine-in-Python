  TO CRACK DUNGEON & THESEUS AND THE MINO TAUR BY TSR, I HAVE A METHOD THAT

REQUI RES NO WIERD HARDWARE OR EXTRA CARDS.  THIS PROGRAM IS WRITTEN IN BASIC

AND US ES FILE NAMES TO LOAD FILES, BUT IT DOE SN'T HAVE A CATALOG SO YOU HAVE

TO CRAC K IT ANOTHER WAY BESIDES DEMUFFIN.HERE IS WHAT TO DO:



BOOT DUNGEON

WHEN IT SAYS"PLEASE WAIT" THEN PRESS RE

SET TWICE.

CLOSE

LOAD HELLO

D6:0

  NOW YOU CAN GO TO BASIC AND LIST THE PROGRAM.BUT THERES MORE PROGRAMS TO THE

GAME!  SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS FIND TH E ENDING APPLESOFT ADDRESS AT $AF.B0

(L ISTED IN REVERSE ORDER) AND USE THE MON ITOR MOVE COMMAND TO MOVE IT INTO A

SAF E AREA.I CAN'T REMEBER THE ACTUAL ADDRE SS FOR THE PROGRAMS, BUT I WILL

GIVE YO U THE CORRECT FORMAT FOR DOING THIS:  6000<800.[WHAT EVER IS IN

$AB.F0,INREVE RSE ORDER]M [RETURN] THEN YOU BOOT DOS 3.3 AND MOVE IT BACK TO

THE CORRECT PLACE IN MEMORY:  800<6000.[6000+WHATEVER WAS IN AB.F0]M



  NOW FIX THE AB.FO TO WHAT THEY WERE BEF ORE AND SAVE THE PROGRAM!  IN AWHILE,

YOU WILL HAVE IT CRACKED!



BY THE WAY

D6:0 - CANCELS THE THING THAT MAKES THE

       PROGRAM IN MEMORY RUN EVERY TIME

       YOU TYPE A COMMAND IN APPLESOFT.



A44D:4C 69 FF - MAKES IT SO WHEN YOU LO
