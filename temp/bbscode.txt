OVERVIEW: ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
     The TurleyCode BBS Rating System, (TurleyCode, for short)
     was developed for a quick identification of Electronic
     Bulletin Board Systems by a simple Alpha-Numeric means.  The
     BBS's "TurleyCode" would give the potential caller a brief
     description of what they will find on that BBS.  Even
     though, the TurleyCode BBS Rating System is copyrighted, all
     may use it without payment.  All that is asked is that it is
     not modified in any form without the expressed written
     consent of David D. Turley.  This system is by no means all
     inclusive.  It wasn't designed to be so.  It was designed to
     give an idea of what type of system the user should expect.
WHO MAY USE IT: ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
     Any BBS Sysop or BBS List maker may use this system for a
     quick, and standard method for BBS designation.  Once again,
     all that is asked is that it remain un-tampered with, so
     that there will only be one version, and not multiple
     versions.  The right of revision is held by the author,
     David D. Turley, who may make revisions when necessary.
USAGE: ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
