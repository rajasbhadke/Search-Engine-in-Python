
LANTERN OF D'GAMMA (Picture-Text Adventure)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive


     When King Louis d'Gamma discovered his castle would soon fall to treacherous retainers, he hid his treasure as well as clues to its whereabouts and a magic lantern. Since the traitors were no good at either puzzles or math, the legendary hoard remains to this day, unclaimed and waiting for someone like you to solve the ancient mystery.

    "Lantern of D'Gamma" is intended as a fun way to involve young adventurers in using middle school math skills. While the interesting worksheets may help, the game is more likely to produce a bumper crop of English majors, all dedicated to writing better computer adventures. Aside from weak parsing, there are numerous fatal traps and no provisions for saving a game. (I typed in "SAVE" at one point and the game simply bombed.)  Hopefully, "Lantern..." will be recalled before it puts out too many lights."
