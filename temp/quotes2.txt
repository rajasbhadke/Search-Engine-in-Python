***

	 "By a continuous process of inflation, governments can confiscate,
	 secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their
	 citizens. By this method, they not only confiscate, but they 
	 confiscate arbitrarily; and while the process impoverishes many, 
	 it actually enriches some....The process engages all of the hidden 
	 forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in 
	 a manner that not one man in a million can diagnose."

				   - John Maynard Keynes
			      Economic Consequences of the Peace, 1920

	 Constitution."

			       - Thomas Jefferson

***

	 "But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. 
	 See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and 
	 gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the 
	 law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what 
	 the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime."

				  - Frederic Bastiat
				    The Law

***

	 "There is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful,

				 - President Woodrow Wilson

***

	 "The voice of protest, of warning, of appeal is never more needed 
	 than when the clamor of fife and drum, echoed by the press and too 
	 often by the pulpit, is bidding all men fall in step and obey in 
	 silence the tyrannous word of command. Then, more than ever, it is 
	 the duty of the good citizen not to be silent."

		 "Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious

***

		 "Liberty cannot be preserved without a

		 [emphasis mine]

				 - John Adams

***

		 "The less government we have the better -
		 the fewer laws and the less confided power.
		 The antidote to this abuse of formal government

***

		  "It's unwise to pay too much, but it's worse to pay
		  too little. When you pay too much, you lose a little
		  money - that is all. When you pay too little, you
		  sometimes lose everything, because the thing you
		  bought was incapable of doing the thing it was bought
		  to do. The common law of business balance prohibits
		  paying a little and getting a lot - it can't be done
		  If you deal with the lowest bidder, it is well to add
		  something for the risk you run, and if you do that you
		  will have enough to pay for something better."

				   - John Ruskin (1819-1900)

***

	      If men use their liberty in such a way as to
	      surrender their liberty, are they thereafter
	      any the less slaves?  If people by a plebiscite

	     "Success or failure of endeavors to substitute sound

	     the fate of our civilization is sealed.  Even if such pioneers 
	     are available, however, their efforts will be futile if they
	     meet with indifference and apathy on the part of their fellow

	"Statism postulates the doctrine that the citizen has no

	"Inflation is one of the most important, yet least understood,

	by the news media and some high economic advisors, inflation is
	not a rise in the general level of prices (often referred to as 
	an increase in the cost of living).  Inflation is simply an 
	increase in the supply of money.  This increase in the number of 
	dollars in relation to the goods and services that are put up for 
	sale causes people to bid up prices.  Thus, a general rise in prices 
	is the effect of inflation.  More dollars is the underlying cause
	of the higher prices."
