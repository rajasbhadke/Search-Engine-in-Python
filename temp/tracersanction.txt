Tracer Sanction (Picture-Text Adventure)
Compatible: 48k Apple II+, //e
Requirements: One disk drive

     Known only as "The Wing", the galaxy's most infamous criminal genius has eluded planetary lawmen fro years. Finally, the Stellar Intelligence Agency has taken a hand in the matter assigning you, its top field operative, to shut down the Wing once and for all.

     Tracer Sanction launches you on a chase spanning eight worlds ranging from backwater fuel depots through castle-crowned estates and a burdgeoning metropolis. While the search for clues, locating contacts, and acquisition of useful tools constitute the meat of the mission; an ongoing concern is your short budget. 'The company' supplies a one-man hyperdrive spacer and just enough sols to get started. Finding the money to keep the ship fueled is your problem. Puzzles and perils abound; but your trusty jetpack and a poetically inclined android help even the odds.

     Somewhat in the style of "Sherwood Forest" or "Gruds in Space", "Tracer Sanction" is cute if not especially demanding. Attractive graphics and several clever gimmicks add up to hours of quality entertainment.
