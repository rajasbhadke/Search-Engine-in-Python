FOR A SOCIALISM THAT LIBERATES! 

We fight for anarchism, a social system based on freedom, mutual aid and 
social justice. We are against all forms of state, economic exploitation and 
social oppression. Social wealth and the means to create it must be owned and 
controlled by society otherwise freedom and equality will never be realised. 

Real change can only come through direct action. We need to organise and act 
together. Solidarity is strength! By resistance in our communities and 
workplaces we can change the world. 

A new world can only be created by working class people, by our own actions 
and organisations. It can never be done by a political party acting for us. It 
must be decentralised andmanaged from below, directly by and for everyone 
without bosses, politicians, leaders and other parasites. 

The movement to create such a free society must reflect its principles of 
liberty, equality and federalism. We must build the ideas and structures of 
the new world today, in our struggles, not only in Scotland but across the 
globe. 

Glasgow Anarchist Group is dedicated to this task. By our words and actions we 
try to spread the anarchist message and encourage the spirit of revolt. 

Liberty, Equality, Solidarity!
