  Many years ago,an evil began to spread across the land.It was centered in the "Shadowkeep",the home of the powelful wizard,Nacomedon.The demon,Dal'Brad,had imprisoned Nacromeden in a crystal,and held his captive deep in the tower while he wrought the evl madness.

  This evil spread until it reached the borders of the four races of the earth.Roos,Thalidars,Zhis'ta and Humans alike were threatend by the wretched evil that was spreading from the tower.A few adenvurers were sent forth from each civilization,determined to put a stop to the evil and perhaps acquire a small forture at the same time.

  Roos,hardy explorers of great physical endurance;Thalidars,masters of the ancient art often known as magic;Zhis'ta,agile and shrewed warriors from birth;Humans,intelligent leaders with a knack for getting in trouble--all joined together to fight the demons in the "Shadowkeep".

  Alas,it was not enought.Each was defeated in turn.There was time for just one more group of brave adventures.One more party of heros was needed to topple the cruel and hartless obelisk that was the "Shadowkeep".We call on you,our last and most able chance,to accept the challange--to assemble your party,approach the Keep,and,if your spirit is able,rid the tower of its malicious tenant.

Before beginning the quest to free the wizard Nacomedon,assemble the following:

Supplied Herewith:
------------------
* The Program Disk side "A"
* Three Scenario Disks sides B,C,D

Supplied By The Adventurer:
---------------------------
* Four blank disks,each to become a       copy of one of the four Disk Sides 
  for future games.
* An optional Fifth Blank Disk,to         become a "Save Game/Character Backup    Disk",hereafter referred to as a        "Save Disk".This will be used for       recreated lost adventures and           adventurers.


Then the brave adventurer must complete four small tasks:

 1.Instead the Program Disk Side "A".Turn on your Apple.

 2.Playing the game permanently alters the disks you are using.Thereforecopy each Disk Side onto your Four Blank Disks.Do this by selecting "C" for the "Creating a Playable Disk".The computer will respond.

   "Be Forewarded:This process will         destroy any other data on you Four      Blank Disks!"

 3.Create your Save Disk.This is your only chance to do this.Give an "I" for the option about "Initializing Save Game/Character Backup Disk".

 4.Begin your Quest!Enter "S",and keep your wits wits about you!

  Here at the Lonley Inn,the mysterious proprietor will greet you and ask your name.He is a frienbdly sort,curious about your band of adventurers and egar for your business.He has run this Inn on the edge of the Shadowkeep for many years,unexplaindly protected from the evil of Dal'Brad that lurks so close to his door.

  Before selecting your band from among the many visitors at the Inn.pause and consider the importance of assembling a balanced and able group of adventureres.Up to twenty different characters may be registered with the innkeeper,and from this gathering you will create a band of nine,all who must harmonize and support each other.

  As you register your team,the proprietor will ask a series of questions about each member,questions that concern thier race,profession,and gender.As the details are recorded onto the register,the resulting attributes of each individual are open for your inspection.


*  Characters may be any name,in length up to twelve letters w/ no spaces or numerals.  


The Four Great Races of Roo,Thalidar, Roo,and Human each possess thier own qualities and quirks.Within each race,males are stronger than females,though females if a race have a higher dexterity....

Adventurers are trained in one of the five professions:

WARRIORS:Sturdy masters of the mace and broadsword;at least four per party is a sound grouping.
MONKS:Wise and insightful,agile and vigorous.
RUNEMAGES:Possessors of the Runes of Power;can Decipher glyphs that baffle others.
SHADOWMAGES:Draw thier power from shadow.
NECROMANCERS:Seek power over what is most feared-death..


The innkeeper records the background of each adventurer in his log.It is acknowledge that race,gender,and profession determine a character's attributes.But,of course,all individuals bring strengths and weaknesses that exceed those of thier postions.the proprietor thus allows extra value to be distributed among any adventurer's attributes,in any or all of the six areas:

STRENGTH:How much an individual can carry and the amount of damage he can inflict in combat.
INTELLIGENCE:How many spells a character can learn,and how quickly he can learn new ones.
DEXTERITY:The agility of a character--the ability to move quickly and leap out of (or into) danger.The most dextrous individual moves first in a fight.
POWER:The ability to focus magical energies.Power is drained by magic,restored by rest.A character with no power will not live.
LEADERSHIP:Force of personality.The character with the most leadership will be declared leader of the party.
HIT POINTS:The ability to withstand the physical damage.Hit points are restored by the rest or healing arts,and,as with power,are necessary in order to live.

 Once new adventurers have been registered,review or rename veteran characters from past adventures.

 Also,recreate any whose souls were saved on the Save Disk.Select this option from the list,name the character whose life and spirit should be restored.Welcome the adventurer back into the party.

 Finally,gather the party,selecting uo to nine of the most able and ready.The mission ahead in not for the dull of mind or the frail of spirit.

  The adventurers must prepare for the journey to the Keep.They may give equipment and supplies to each other,and though other means prepare themselves.

  They may also visit Raddath.An enigmatic,pan-dimensional creature.Raddath will offer his wares and wisdom to the party.He has felt the evil of the Keep and thus will give his aid in any way he can.Raddath buys and sells magic and goods,and can heal damage,drain posion,and even revive a character killed while in the Keep.He is not,however,given over to charity.Raddath has no aversion to acquiring a forture while helping destory the Keep.

Futher Note-While Raddath is skilled in magic,he offers on guarentees of the effectiveness of his cures.No refunds.

  The final preporation may be to order the party.Sound orginization is essential within the confines of the Keep.Take this opportunity,it may be your last.

  The road of the Keep is short,but it wears long on the soul of the hero who walks it....

(Of course,if you have become faint of heart,no one will stop you from abandoning the quest now.If you leave this place,you may never see it again...)

          EZEKIEL CAST THE LUMINANCE 
          SPELL
          NAOMI GET THE TORCH AND GIVE

          READY THE MACE
          DAGMAR PUT THE WAND OF TRAVEL           IN THE CHEST

Any command not directed to the certian character will inspire the leader of the party to respond.

   The party as a whole will move following basic commands:
     
         F or FORWARD
         L or LEFT (Turn left)
         R or RIGHT (Turn right)
         B or BACKWARD (Step back)

  Explore the Keep thoroughly,and exercise caution:

         OPEN DOOR   
         CLOSE DOOR   
         LISTEN

  Inhabitants will occasionally allow you to address them,which you should do in either of the following ways.
Do this before they lop your head off:

      ASK SILDRA WHERE THE GOLD IS                        =
       "SILDRA WHERE IS THE GOLD"

  From time to time,assess the damage inflicted onfellow adventurers.

        LOOK PARTY
       (gives members' hit points)
        STATS
        ROLF CONDITION
        LOOK NAOMI

  Magical healing is possible through the aid of Raddath.If a visit to him is impossible,characters may use any magic they possess,but at the expense of some power.

 The adventurers can investigate and aquire objects while in the Keep:

        SEARCH(some characters wil find hidden objects more quickly that others ) 
        
        LOOK SCROLL
        MORDOR GET SCROLL
        FANNIE GET SCROLL
        ZOORA GET ALL
        GET GREAT SWORD AND READY IT     
If an adventurer has too heavy a load,something will need to be dropped.The amount they can carry depends on thier strenght.

        DROP THE BASTERD SWORD
        DROP ALL BUT THE TORCH
        MERCER DROP ALL (exept items            prepared for combat)
        
 Or,the adventurer might simply give the object away.
    
        MYRA GIVE ROBERT THE GEM OF 
        CHANCE
        GIVE THE SOGGY STICK TO BILL
        
You might wish to let one object hold another.

      OPEN THE BOX AND PUT THE GOLD
      INSIDE AND CLOSE BOX
      PUT ROCK IN HOLE 
      PLACE GOLD ON THE TABLE
     
Find out what an object can do by using or examining it.

      USE THE FUNNY ROCK 
      EXAMINE THE FUNNY ROCK
      
If you have a particular use in mind,and a certian target,state those.

      SMASH THE ALTER WITH THE BREAKER
      BAR
      ATTACK THE CORD WITH THE GREAT          SWORD

  Light is require to explore the dark,dank Keep.Without a lit torch (or a light spell),searching will be impossible.(Combat will be possible but difficult;there would be no warning at the approach of monsters).Any illumination will serve the entire group,but will eventually extinguish,becoming a soggy stick or used up spell.It is advisable to have several sources of light at any given time.

   Rely on the power of magic;above all else,it will be your key to success.

   Though all may cast spells within the Keep,many have the capacity to learn no more than a scant or so.Power and training determine one's triumph while using this ancient art.Mage's,with exeptionally learned backgrounds,begin the journey with knowlegge of a small number of spells.Raddath has aquired many others,which he makes available for sale to the hapeful adventurer.

   As all may cast spells,so will all feel the effects of the task.After casting a spell,even the most powerful magician weakens,and eventually must restore powers with sleep.Monitors the loss of an adventurer.

   Up to two spells or magical artifacts may be active at any one time.

    INVOKE RING OF LIFE AND CAST THE 
    FORTRESS SPELL

  Discover more about spell you aquire by reading or learning them.

   READ BOOK OF DARKNESS
   LEARN DEATH SPELL
   GET HEAL SCROLL,LEARN IT,CAST IT

  A scroll that is successfully learned becomes a spell that may be cast.The scroll will vanish once it has been learned.

  Mere mortals are limited in the number of spells they may know,When one's memory is full and the spell cannot be learned,a spell must be forgotten.

      FORGET DEATH SPELL

 Once a spell has been forgotten,only another scroll will grant a new opportunity to aquire the spell.

 Ready the magical artifacts as you prepared other weaponry.

      READY SOULEATHER SWORD

 Learning magical spells is sufficient preparation for use.

 Watch for podiums while in the Keep.Through these devices you and you band of adventurers may quickly transport to another level of the Tower.The indications needed to operate these mysterious devices are always changing.

 Finally,the halls of the Keep are laced with spells that bind,hide,or hinder.Doors are often sealed with spells of warding,released only by the journey before you.The password that are known:

        SAFTEY
        LAIR
        PASS
        FRIEND 
        HOME

 Be apprised of the possibilty of other passwords;and hope that if you are unsuccessful in vanquishing the demons from the Keep,that you will at least return to tell your successors what you learned.

  Successful warriors appoach combat with weapons,equipment,and magic in readiness.An adventurer would do well to have equipment prepared for both Attack and Parry.

       READY BASTARD SWORD
       PREPARE GREAT SHIELD
       WEAR SCALE MAIL

At a sign of combat,the party will,at your command,negotiate,flee,or remain to fight.When you mobilize the ranks and determine the course of action,you may assign each member to attack,parry,cast spells,change places,prepare equipment,or,of coarse,do nothing.

 When assigning adventurers to thier tasks,consider the skills that they might posses due to heritage and profession.These skills might cause them to perform some tasks better that others.Before combat,gain information on a member's skill as such:

         EXAMINE ELLA

The skills:

ATTACK:Skills necessary to land a blow on an enemy.

PARRY:Success with a character can avoid or deflect a blow.

MAGIC:Technical proficiency in casting magic.

OPEN:The ability to open sealed or locked objects.

SEARCH:The aptitude for finding hidden objects.
  

 If combat has worsend the condition of the party,change positions to preserve life and limb.Enter:

            ORDER

 And,as weariness sets in,allow the few remaining good spirits in the Keep tto restore your band's energy.Rest for up to ten hours,the resume the journey.One hit point and a unit of power is restored to each character for every hour of sleep.

        SLEEP FOR 3 HOURS

Beware:Monsters can sense when a party is asleep and unprepared for attack.A blow while asleep can be far worse than the extremes of combat.Consider the use of certian spells that will conceal the sleeping party from marauding monsters.Or,perhaps choose a safer course:sleep outside the confines of the Keep.

  When perils strike and the fate of the party is in jeopardy,preserve the spirit of the adventure onto the disk we have named "Save Disk"(See Part I).This way,if the situation later becomes hopeless,you may send the party back in time to the earlier conditions,as recorded on the Save Disk.

  This is also useful if you must interrupt the quest.Recorded the adventure and later return.

  To save the adventure,enter:

        SAVE

You will then need to insert the Save Disk.If you have a second drive,place the Save Disk there.The program will ask you to assin a number to the verion of the adventure you are saving.Make a note of the number you give,and then the conditions of the adventure.The computer will alert you when the adventure has been successfully saved and you may proceed.

 Up to 15 games may be saved onot your Save Disk.

  When you are ready to restore:

         RESTORE

 As before,insert the Save Disk,and,finally,give the number of the adventure you wish to restore.

 Let your mind be occupied by the fight itself,and not with the trivia of your
whereabouts.Have at hand numerous sheets of gridded parchment,for map-making.

 On these sheets,record the halls,the room,the sairs and floors of the Keep.

            E.CREATURES 
            ***********

BARQUEST:Wolf-like and adept at magic.The Barguest prefers to guard places of power,such as temples and castles,and comes to its duties at the call of magic.Its lack of armor should not be confused with a physical frailty.

BROLLACHAN:Two eyes,a grinning mouth,and shapeless substance-that is all.Evolved from horrible creatures in the deepest unexplored marshlands,the Brollachan is difficult to destroy with conventional weaponry.At the lack of a proper spell,adventurers should flee.

COCKATRICE:A thoroghly evil creature composed of the head,wings,and feet of a large fighting cock.Its body is covered with scales,and it has a long,barbed serpent's tail.

DEMON:A large humaniod of terrifying appearance.Eyes cast an evil gleam above protruding fangs,and the black body is often winged,with a red glow as if from flame.Enchanted or mundane weapons often fail,for the Demon is near impossible to destroy.

FACHAN:Bizarre and feathered,this foul creature resemble the trunk of a disease tree.One arm sprouts from the middle of its chest.Its lone eye stares from the middle of its head.It prefers to batter its foes,and jumps from place to place on its single leg.

FOUL FROND:This green plant-like creature has a bite of poison that can lay flat an adventurer in quick order.When its enemy succeds in cutting it down,it may leave behinds a silver rose.

GARGOYLE:Short,propelled by bat-like wings,and possesing a spiked tail,spurred elbows,And a horned head.The gargoyle is physically tough with rough,stone like skin.Its nagical powers are keen,though the creature is not well-armored.  

GHOST:Quick and troublesome,the residual life force of a once living creature,ghosts can be bitter about thier plight and thus quite unplesant.An unfortunate death from before may have bound this creature to a single spot.

GOBLIN:Puny and dirty,ugly and irritating.Goblins often dress in tatterd,cast-off clothing and have little to distinguish them.

HUMAN:The best if traits can turn the most sour.A small number of these adaptable bipeds have turned to evil,and have used thier knowledge is armor and civilization to aid the realm of Dal'brad.Humans can adopt a negotiative stance,but be warry of traitors and falsehood.

VENOMOUS SHEEP:Small and innocent in appearance,these mindless,fanged creatures can inject a powerful poison which has no antidote.They display great aggresion.

OGRE:Physically strong but unmagical,the ogre is second cousin to the Troll.Its dark skin coloring is tinged with red.

RED CAP:Evil creatures that thrive when residing on sites of great bloodshed.Their terms of service allow them to wet there caps with the blood of their victims.

STOOR WORM:A large,slow,python like creature with a dragon's head may often be found keeping guard over treasures.After constricting an adventurer's armor and shattering it,the Worm will batterits vicim.

TROLL:A weaker relative to the ORGE,but nonetheless tough in physical battle.This hideous humaniod has dark,scaly skin and misshapen eyes.They dislike sunlight;the dark has invaded thier core and has made them cunning and evil.

WIGHT:Like the GHOST,often has an unearthly tie to a grave.They are slow to act possibly due to the rotting corpses they inhabit.Their great magical power makes them difficult adversaries.

ZHIS'TA:A hatred of evil has turned into a love of it.When ZHIS'TA become part of the evil realm,their cunning and agility take on a keenness that is hard to overcome,However,these traitors,like the Humansthat have come into the Keep,have a weakness that can be turned to advantage at the hands of an able warrior.
