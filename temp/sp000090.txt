"Prometheus" (anarchist rant, former .plan file)

by j z provo

...then there was the time when the man was with a comerade, cohort, friend.

   This person snickered at one of his works, asking "Just what the HELL does
it mean?"
   Fire brewed in the man's eyes; artist turned madman grabbed his friend by
the collar and slammed a rather suprised companion into the wall. 
   "Mean? MEAN?" He was shouting. "What does the sum total of your life _mean_?
What will your life mean when you're gone? ...nothing. This is a representation
of you and all those like you.  Here -look!- do you see this? This is your 
mindless chase after meaningless scraps of paper. There is your blind acceptance
of The Rules... This piece is a monument to modern stupidity; to those who have
been _so_ indoctrinated that they cannot even CONCEIVE of not 'playing by the
rules', let alone breaking them or even think that other rules could exist. For 
all those to whom the word 'rebellion' has been programmed to mean 'violent
conflict', and who believe that a society dedicated to grinding the teeth of
Moloch with their children is the natural way, that we and our so-called culture
are the endpoint of evolution and 'intelligence'..."
   Suddenly he breaks off with a sigh. A tired, time-worn sound. He looks away..
And I turn back to you with a look of sadness, a sadness you will never 
comprehend. The sadness of a Prometheus who finds his gift of fire only being 
used to roast infidels.
