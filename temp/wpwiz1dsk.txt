Adding Write-Protect to Wizardry I boot disk image


     After you download the two .dsk.gz files and run each through
WinZip and make sure each has the .dsk extension on the file name,
you may still not be able to get Wiz-1 working on your emulator.

     According to the docs included on Asimov, the boot
disk needs to have write-protect set. (This has always been true of
actual diskette copies of Wiz-1, too.) I'm pretty sure booting the
diskette without write-protect messes up the copy.

     With a real diskette, you would just stick on a write-protect tab
to cover the notch. On an emulator, you need some way to tell the boot
drive that write-protect is ON. (i.e. you need a Buggie Drive on your
emulator!)  There seems to no way to do this on AppleWin.

     One trick that does seem to work is to change the boot disk image
file's attribute's so that Read Only is set. Try this ...

Right-click on the file Wizardry_|_boot.dsk
Select "Properties"
Click "Read Only"
Click "Okay"

 
     When I tried booting a new copy of Wizardry_|_boot.dsk on AppleWin,
the program would hang when I pressed SPACE. When I tried booting
another copy which had the Read Only attribute set, the program
continued on to the game menu when I pressed SPACE. So, setting the
attribute seems to work like a write-protect tab. Good luck!
