Zonker Harris/AD:
 Anarchy cannot rule. Anarchy is the destruction of rule. A few twits out 
there think that it makes people drop their jaws to see "ANARCHY" somewhere in 
their messages. Usage like "ANARCHY RULES" prove just how very little they 
actually know about it. Anarchy is not just going ANARCHY RULESANARCHY RULES 
in your messages, in fact, the less people know about you the better. It 
really pisses me off to see jackasses seeking hipness try to proclaim the cause
of others. Go ahead, announce yourselves as Anarchists, but when the new 
precinct goes up I hope they see your signs. Anarchy is the cause of the 
population of the world, and the fact is many of you self-proclaimed Anarchists
would probably be overwhelmed if a true Anarchist revolt ever occurs.

Subj: Profanity/Originality/Garbage
From: THE DICER
Date: 04-24-85 at 07:16 PM

ADDRESSED TO JOHN PECACEK...


I guess the price we pay for having this board available to everyone is the 
occasional profanity and frequent posting of phone numbers/codes that mean 
nothing, are not new, are blatantly illegal and therefore against policy, or 
are simply ruggish.

However, I WILL NOT SIT STILL and listen to a Doctor Dicklick spout off.
Maybe I've had enought of 'NEW WARE' or 'WHAT'S THIS' or 'NEED BOX PLANS'
messages. Perhaps this is the last straw. The purpose of any board, however, 
including this one, is to further people's knowledge. That means people that 
have a legitimate interest in learning, and the phone system we use without 
thinking about each day is something beautiful that people should* know more 
about. To make that easier on this board, and on all others, I propose the 
following, and it wouldn't take that much coding:

 1. Modify the editor to disallow messages containing swear words. I think 
    this would have the most impact on the anonymous board. As sysop, if 
    you think having phreak philes on board gives a bad reputation, then 
    what do you suppose having insults to gays and others people does for 
    you on that particular board? Sysops *aren't* responsible for what 
    goes up on their boards, but the **are** responsible for it staying 
    there.

 2. I'm not one to advocate 'posting requirements' or 'originality require- 
    ments,' since there are people who don't know a lot and who should be 
    able to learn if they want to. I would suggest, however, that you ban 
    the words: NEW, WARE, AWESOME, GREAT, LATEST, GAY, FAG, JERK, HOT and 
    others from the titles of messages. And their permutations, too. I 
    think sometimes that writing a title like, 'LATEST AWESOME WARES' ac- 
    tually inspires these ruggies to embellish the rest of the message. 
    There are those who will say, but at least we can tell from the title 
    whether to read a message or not, and you're right...I know when to 
    press the space bar...right after I've seen the title. However, it is 
    also the sysop's responsibility to do a little screening, and since the 
    kind of message I'm talking about is so blatantly obvious, cleaning up 
    this entire board would not be a hard thing (or timeconsuming) to do.

I've got a lot more thoughts, but that's enough for now. John, I guess I am
opening a question of sysop responsibility, but I feel that I can do that on 
this board. I don't think anybody, even other sysops, will say that this 
isn't one of the nicest boards in the country. I'm interested in maintaining 
that pleasantness. I don't think what I've outlined has been unfair in the 
slightest, nor would the programming aspects be too timeconsuming. You 
already must have some word scanning function in already, at least to check 
for duplicate titles.

I say once again, the purpose of any bulletin board is to learn. The messages 
preceeding this one listed information of no use: one of those five 'hacking' 
numbers was the Safehouse itself. In the last message, how does only a four 
digit number help? We need a NPA and exchange number if it is indeed a phone 
number. People have complained of the ruggie problem before. I think it's 
time to do something about it. But most important, I think it's time to 
separate the ruggies from the people who truly want to learn, and to help 
those people to whatever level of understanding they desire. That's why I do 
what I do...to learn. We have a responsibility as users and the sysop has a 
reponsibility as an administrator to let that learning process grow.

 This is addressed to the last msg. It would not be fair to many users to 
edit everything they do. differnt people like differnt things some people feel 
that new ware msg are "k-kool". some users feel they cannot express them self 
without swearing and to try to scan it would be near impossible remember many 
of the people on this system make it their habit to get around things the could 
do such things as S*H*I*T well that is even worse than if it was just typed. 
We also can't infringe on the users first amendment rights now can we. What I 
am trying to say is it is too hard for the sysop to POLICE the board all they
time should not be his job. If you do not like something you should voice you
opion and see how others feel as you did. but if everyone wants to post (I 
don't know why) New Ware or call this rad bbs msg they can. as long as they 
put them in the right place. As this one is not and I am sorry for that but I
put it here for the sake of coherrent discussion.
