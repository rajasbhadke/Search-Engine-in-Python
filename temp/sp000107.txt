I sit on a man's back, choking him, and making him carry me, and yet

The changed form and substance of law is rather like what a jailer

  "A Russian should rejoice if Poland, the Baltic Provinces, Finland,
Armenia, should be separated, freed from Russia; so with an Englishman
in regard to Ireland, India and other possessions; and each should
help to do this, because the greater the state, the more wrong and
cruel is its patriotism, and the greater is the sum of suffering upon
which its power is founded.  Therefore, if we really wish to be what
we profess to be, we must not only cease our present desire for the
growth of the state, but we must desire its decrease, its weakening,
and help this forward with all our might."

   Leo Tolstoy, from  "Writings on Civil Disobedience and Nonviolence,"
written in 1886.
