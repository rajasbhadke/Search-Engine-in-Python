Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Text Adventure)
Compatible: 48k Apple II+, //e, //c
Requirements: One disk drive

     It's bad enough when your home is on the Demolition Department's Top Ten; But what do you do when a new interstellar bypass means the demolition of your planet? You hitchhike a ride on the nearest Vogon spaceship, of course.

     Based on the best-selling novel, "Hitchhikker's Guide to the Galaxy"     quickly diverges into a kind of open-ended adventure which you win by accumulating all 400 game points. Accompanied by the eccentric alien, Ford Prefect, your odyssey includes encounters with the notorious Bugblatter Beast of Traal, personality switches, lessons in poetry appreciation, and a real braintwister of a maze.

     Incorporating Infocom's excellent parsing, "Hitchikker's Guide '" is often entertaining but often frustrating as well. While the occassional requirement that a command be repeated several times enhances the atmosphere of hapless wandering; it also makes solution testing unnecessarily tiresome. Documentation and support trinkets set a new quality standard; but all the fluff in Aurthur Dent's pockets won't save this one.
