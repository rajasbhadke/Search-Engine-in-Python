Anarchist Reading List

The following list is slanted towards anarchosyndicalism, but George
Woodcock's 'Anarchist Reader' and 'Anarchism' cover most of the historical anarchist 
movements and ideas, and is a good start.

General:

'Anarchism Today', David E. Apter and James Joll, MacMillan (ISBN 333 12041
8), has chapters on various movements and a bibliography of Anarchism in
print.  George Woodcock's Anarchist Reader and Anarchism also have useful
bibliographies.  Daniel Guerin's 'Anarchism' (Monthly Review Press,
ISBN 85345-175-3) takes an anarchosyndicalist point of view (and has
a bibliography).  Paul Avrich's 'Anarchist Portraits' (Princeton University Press 
1988, ISBN-N-0-691-00609-1) covers Russian and American anarchists.
