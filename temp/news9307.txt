I want to thank The Flying Chicken for his support of The INN, again he has
written an excellent article for the modders out there. Thanks TFC.

The Bishop 1 @4550 starts next month as the coordinator for the INN Mod [or
mods] of The Month. I am looking forward to the selections he makes.

***

It has been hot in the Western NY Area the home of IceNET... some say we
should change the name from IceNET to HeatNet. Our brain of truely has
been slowed considerably, hence the late and brief INN for this month.

***

I recently sent Wayne 1@1 WWIVNet some questions and here they are:

SA...  Rumors are a flying as to the release date of WWIV 4.23, when do you
think would be an accurate date of it's release?

Wayne...  Unfortunately, no idea yet.

SA...  What new features should we expect to see?

Wayne...  Definitely multiple languages, some bug fixes, and cosmetic
enhancements. Really don't have a list set up yet.

SA...  You must spend many, many hours programing and coming up with ideas,
plus hours on end of tech help. What motivates you to continue the updates
of WWIV and the support of WWIV?

Wayne...  Mostly it's answering email.  I don't know why I keep doing it.

SA...  What is your view on all the different networks that are springing up
all over the country since the release of the multinet 4.21a?

Wayne...  I think we'll see the number drop after a while.

SA...  Finally, many are wondering if WWIV will go multi line, is this in
the future for sure?

Wayne...  No, not for sure, but it is a possibility for v4.23.  We're
looking into it now.

***

I was hoping for some information on the release of 4.23 but as you can see
he has no idea. Multilined WWIV seems to be the item most wanted by WWIV
Sysops and it looks like it is on the way.

***

I have heard of many sysops having a net validate bug, wherein a sub without
Net Val turned on still asked if you would like to net validate messages.
Also if net val was on it would not ask you to validate. I had the same
problem. Our friend the Deranged Alchemist sent me the following fix. It
works and I am happy :).

OK,  Try this...
The Deranged Alchemist #1 @6855

     Try the following (Assuming you have the source and a compiler):

Load up MSGBASE1.C and search for the function scan();

void scan(int msgnum, int optype, int *nextsub)
{
  char s[95],s1[95],s2[95],*b,*ss1;   /* s, s1, and s2 upped to 95 chars */
  int i,i1,i2,done,quit,abort,next,val,realexpress;
  slrec ss;
  long l,len;
  postrec p,p1;

  irt[0]=0;
  irt_name[0]=0;
  done=0;


Note that s[81], s1[81], and s2[81] were upped to 95 characters.  This fixed
my problem.

If you don't have the source, or want to try this first, get a copy of the
virgin BBS.STR (ENGLISH.STR in the ZIP file) put it in gfiles as BBS.STR
(back up your modded STR file) and see if the problem goes away.  If it
does, Whala!

                                    Wayne
                          The Lab BBS   (618)462-0767

Thanks Wayne for the fix, this one was a killer on my BBS....

    WWIV BBS Software has been often overlooked by magazines which have
often focused on more expensive commercial products such as Major BBS,
TBBS, and PcBoard or on public domain software such as RBBS.  WWIV,
which stands for World War IV, has made significant ground in the
shareware market with several thousand systems registered world wide.

     WWIV sysops have been primarily hobbiests who were drawn to WWIV
by several factors.  It is extremely easy to set up.  It is inexpensive
to register and registration permits access to the source code.  It has
one of the smoothest working networks available, and it allows the sysop
to significantly customize the BBSs without resorting to source
modifications while permitting the registered sysop to make
modifications to the software to give his board a "unique" flavor.

EASE OF SET UP:

    From its beginnings as a teenager's project written in BASIC, WWIV
has been easy to set up, featuring an INIT (initialization) program that
created the necessary directories and permitted the sysop to easily
enter the system specific information required of the system.  From its
beginning in BASIC, WWIV was written in Pascal and finally in "C".  Its
origins as a "theme" board with a militaristic flavor have disappeared
but its power, its features, and its ease of set up have steadily
progressed since 1986 when the first registration was received.

    Documentation is complete and orderly.  While it is not necessary
for a sysop to read the documentation before installing WWIV, it will
help.  Documentation files for installation, sysop commands and users
are included with each version.

    When setting WWIV up for the first time, the sysop runs the
initialization program and is presented with a menu of set-up options
most of which are self-explanatory.  One feature that seems to be unique
to WWIV is that the initialization will have the system try to automatically
detect the brand, model, and speed of the modem.  Once that is detected, the
system will automatically set the modem parameters that should work with
the modem.  A sysop may "tweak" the modem parameters if necessary, but
most sysops find the automatically selected ones to be close to optimal.

    The initialization menu is simple and appears as follows:

    1. System info (name, passwords, newuser info, etc)
    2. More system info (net, status, etc)
    3. Paths (messages, gfiles, data, etc)
    4. Com port info (port, IRQ, base address, etc)
    5. Select modem type (now GEN-V32) <-- Gives you the modem type detected.
    6. External programs (zip, terminal, etc)
    7. External protocols (zmodem, hs/link, jmodem, etc)
    8. External editors (full screen)
    9. SecLev data changes
    0. Auto-Validation data changes
    A. Auto-detect modem type (if possible)
    N. Update network info
    U. Change max # sub/dirs
    Q. Quit


    Customization of the BBS can actually begin here in some of the
options available through the INIT program, such as whether or not you
allow aliases or require real names, whether or not you wish users to be
informed at logon regarding files which they uploaded that have been
downloaded by others, and whether or not you wish to have a
"free-format" phone number in order to accommodate European systems.
Customization can also be done by changing certain default messages to
be whatever you wish.  The system supports color ansi, black and white
ansi, and non-ansi default messages and displays the appropriate message
to the user.  Sysops requiring help with the initialization options
and/or customization of default messages may consult the documentation
or seek help from the designated WWIV support boards located in the USA
and throughout the world.


    WWIV offers the sysop the ability to assign up to 255 different security
levels, though most sysops only use 4 - 10 levels.  Each of these levels can
be configured for the amount of time per day, time per logon, how many
messages can be read, how many private E-mails the user can send, how many
posts the user can make on public message bases and whether or not the user
can post anonymously.  In addition the sysop can assign (AR's), account
restrictions, which can be used for various purposes such as allowing only a
certain group access to a specified message base.  There are also
(DAR's), Download account restrictions which are used much the same way as
the (AR's) and these are used in the files section of the system.

    There are also function keys that the sysop can use while a user is online
to increase a new user's security level, drop to DOS, chat with the user,
increase or decrease a user's time in increments of 5 minutes, drop the user
offline and give the sysop the user's and system's activity for the day.

    WWIV permits the system to have as many as 999 message bases and 999 file
directories.  Each file directory can hold as many as 499 files, giving
the system the capacity of 498,501 files.  Built-in commands support the
two most popular file description formats available on CD-ROMS so that a
sysop can easily use CD-ROMS on his system if he wishes.


    System menus are available in both Ansi and Ascii formats and may be
easily customized by the sysop who wishes to have some individuality to
his system.


WWIV BASED NETWORKS:

    WWIV also supports several WWIV based networks.  The oldest and
largest of these is WWIVnet with over 1500 member systems.  IceNET and
WWIVlink are also relatively large WWIV based networks boasting over 600
members each.  There are numerous small WWIV based networks that are
primarily local and/or devoted to special topics.  A WWIV board may be
on more than one network.

    By joining a network the sysop can subscribe to a wide variety of
networked message bases (subs) hosted by other sysops.  The selection of
subs that are available are many and diverse.  The next version of WWIV
which should be released during the fall of 1993 will also have FidoNet
capability. Presently there are 42 documented WWIV based networks that a
sysop can join.

WWIV FROM THE USER'S SIDE:


    A user logging onto a WWIV system for the first time encounters a
series of questions.  These questions enable the sysop to know a little
about his users and they also set the user's capabilities such as ANSI,
COLOR, etc.  Unmodified WWIV systems will use the following questions:

        Ansi graphics support detected.  Use it?
        Do you want color?
        Alias/Handle?
        Real Name?
        Voice phone?
        Data phone?
        Street address?
        City?
        St?
        Country?
        Zip code?
        Sex?
        Date of birth?

    After the user has entered this information, he is asked to leave
feedback ( a message) to the sysop.  New users normally have limited access
to the system until the sysop validates their account.

    A validated user normally will have access to the several
sub-systems available on a WWIV board: Message Base area, General Text
File area (bulletins), on-line programs, voting booth and file transfer
section.  Each section has its own menu of commands which a user can read.
Expert users may toggle the menu status off. The user can obtain online
help at anytime by hitting CTRL-O.

WWIV SUPPORT:

   WWIV is a dynamic BBS system that offers one or two new releases each
year.  Each new release adds additional features and yet these new
releases do not cost the registered sysop any additional money.  WWIV
support boards have many utilities, modifications, and on-line games
available for downloading by WWIV sysops.  These support boards also are
available to answer technical questions that may arise by WWIV sysops.

    The registration fee for WWIV is $80.00.  Registration fees and/or
information about registration may be obtained from WWIV Software
Services, P.O. Box 720455, McAllen, TX 78504-0455

    In short, the WWIV software offers an inexpensive beginning to the
fascinating hobby of running a bbs.

                         by Alken Foijet Godden #1 @8869

     I'm afraid to say that there is no easy answer when it comes to making
original mods on a board.  It would be close to impossible for me to write a
mod package that would make a modded BBS DESQview friendly since there is a
vast quantity of things that could have happened to make it unfriendly.

     The easiest problem to predict is footprint size.  Many people look at
their file size and decide that it is the same size as what's in memory.
Ignore the file size and run some memory checks while the program is
running, your results should be right on the money.  Write down the routine
you went through each time you checked the programs memory - this will
insure accurate results.

Reducing overhead in WWIV:

     OVERLAYS:  You can reduce your EXE size just by optimizing the
overlayed files that already exist.  The size of your total overlayed files
in memory is twice the size of your largest overlayed file (standard
Borland).  So, by splitting up the largest file into smaller ones you can
gain some memory without overlaying more functions then what you started
with. You have very little control over when your overlays reside in memory,
so try to keep functions that call each other within the same file(s).

     Just looking at the map should tell you if there are any files that are
noticeably larger than any others. You can overlay functions that weren't
overlayed to begin with, but you should be very picky as to what exactly
you're overlaying.  Some functions use memory addresses to call other
functions/data.  If this data/function was overlayed it's likely that your
program will spit up all over you.  This includes declaring global variables
within an overlayed file - if they are used by other files.

     SHRINKING:  I don't suggest it, but it's easy enough to get the BBS to
shrink from WFC to do network calls (receive too).  The problem that arises
is that if you need to shrink from WFC, it's also likely that you'll need to
shrink before running your text editors also - which I found to be a pain to
do.

     LARGE STRUCTURES:  WWIV has incredible structures, and with a large
user base and many networks they become even more incredible.  I won't say
exactly what to do about the structures, but they definitely become
cumbersome.

     It might be a good idea to save all of these large structures to disk
before running any external programs, and release the memory for that period
of time.  Any buffers could be freed before an external program runs also.

     You could rearrange some code so that the memory is freed before a
program will need memory.  Here is an example in "attempt_callout(void)"
where a structure is used to find out what board to call.  The memory isn't
freed until well after it is done with the structure.  This isn't a mod, but
I've corrected the problem in theory:

          fl1 += weight[nn][i];                         // existing code.
          if (fl1>=fl) {                                // It just finished
            i1=i;                                       // using "weight" and
            break;                                      // "try"
          }                                             //
          if (fl1>=fl) {                                //
            i1=i;                                       //
            break;                                      //
          }                                             //
        }                                               //
      }                                                 //
      if (i1!=-1) {                                     //
        for (nn=0; nn<net_num_max; nn++) {  // All I did was copy these
          if (try[nn])                      // lines from the bottom of the
            farfree(try[nn]);               // function.
          if (weight[nn])                   //
            farfree(weight[nn]);            // This will save you 4 bytes per
        }                                   // network and 6 bytes per connect
        farfree(try);                       // that you have.
        farfree(weight);                    //

        do_callout(net_networks[net_num].con[i1].sysnum); // existing
        time(&l);                                         //
        last_time_c=l;                                    //

        set_net_num(0);                     // reset network stuff
        return;                             // no reason to be in this
function
                                            // anymore
      }                                                   // existing
    }                                                     //
  }                                                       //

     I have a friend who has about 15 networks and an average of five
connects a piece (I really don't keep track).  And where he's not about to
get excited about 510 bytes, it's the theory that's important.

     I chose that piece of code because it was easy to demonstrate.  If you
find yourself disagreeing with anything I've said, it's the nature of
programming.  If we all had the same ideas we'd all write the same programs.

     MATH COPROCESSOR:  If you have a math coprocessor, use it.  No reason
why not to.  By turning floating point emulation off you should gain a
substantial amount of memory.  WWIV will be able to use the math coprocessor
instead of calculating floating point numbers with the code Borland
supplies.

     Remember to compile the entire BBS when changing things that effect the
program globally (this includes overlays).

Making your program DESQview friendly:

     INTERRUPTS:  All interrupts except 50H-57H, 68H-6FH, and 78H-7FH, are
fair game.  DESQview uses these interrupts for its own use, do not hook
them.

     INT 15H is used for DESQview's API.  Your interrupt handler must
preserve all registers both going into DESQview's interrupt handler and
returning from DESQview's interrupt handler.

     INT 1CH / INT 08H (timers) are set up by DESQview.  The amount of
consecutive time slices is determined here, 5 foreground ticks = 5
consecutive timer interrupts.  It's highly advised to pass control to the
previous handler as quickly as possible because DESQview will hold off other
interrupts until you do - which can effect high speed communications.


     DESQview's API: WWIVv422 now comes with a bit of API support.  These
improvements are a step in the right direction, but they are not "fully"
there yet.  WWIV uses 4 of DESQview's API calls.  DESQview has 151 API
functions that I'm aware of.  If WWIV becomes a multi-line program using
DESQview expect to see a great deal more of these API calls.

     DISK ACCESS:  I don't recommend trying to alter any file structure
because you'll end up running into problems with external programs that
expect certain structures.  As it is, WWIV is a fine running DOS program.
However, if Wayne intends to make it multi-line it would be advisable that
he create a function that all disk access run through.

     Why?  Because here's where multi-tasking causes big problems with
multiple programs using the same files.  Let's say two WWIV's are running on
two different modems.  One WWIV writes updated information to a file, the
second BBS should be informed of this - but before that, both BBS's should
compare their data to each other because it could be different by this time.

     Having so many places in the code where disk read/writes occur makes
for large code if all of the above is going to take place.  As it is, WWIV's
code could be smaller if all the read/writes were condensed into two or
three functions.

     EXT/EXP MEMORY:  Wayne put in a little piece of commented out code that
I feel might reek havoc on many people who just take the comments off.  This
code causes the compiler to use extended or expanded memory for the
overlays.

     For one thing, you're robbing Peter to pay Paul.  You want to create
some memory in the 640 region, but it's not a straight trade.  For one, the
compiler has to add some code to allow swapping to this memory - which goes
into the base memory.  And secondly, if you shrink the BBS for external
programs the BBS.EXE program isn't even in memory at all - so what's the
point?

     If you want speed, don't use DESQview.  If you're using DESQview it's
because you want to run several programs at once.  Putting overlays into
ext/exp memory only helps in terms of speed - otherwise there's no use for
it.

     The biggest downside to using extended memory while in DESQview is that
DESQview cannot manage it very well.  When two programs request the same
region of ext/exp memory at virtually the same time they can end up
corrupting each others data.  This is do to the nature of time slicing and
ext/exp memory.

     Since you're running DESQview to run more than one program at a time,
try to keep your memory as clean as possible.  You know as a sysop that WWIV
will be running in your first window, but you can't predict what you'll run
in subsequent windows.  Since the known variable is WWIV, then I suggest
keeping this program as friendly as possible.

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ´  An Interview With The Sub List Man   ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
                   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


SA... Odin being the subslist coordinator must be fun keeping up with all
the sub changes. What do you do to stay on top of the situation?

Odin:  It's not easy staying on top of things.  When I first started, it
       took 5 hours to get the first subs list out.  The Editor left me over
       a month's work (ugh!).  After that it took me about 1.5 hrs each
       "ping." Then, during my Easter break, I decided to write a program.
       This program was written in 2 days in Turbo Pascal 6.0.  It allows me
       to update the subs list from a ping in about 15 minutes (yeah!).  It
       also let's me set up the SUBS.* files anyway I want.  I can place
       whatever category I want in which ever SUB file.  It has incorporated
       CATEG.NET and a file called N99999.NET (list of all nodes which is
       updated by another program after NETWORK3.EXE is run).

SA... What could the sub hosts do to help?

Odin:  For starters, they should check their //BOARDEDIT to make sure that
       the 'O' option for each of their subs is set to how they want the
       name to look in the subs files.  If they want, they can leave it
       blank.  Then the ping will grab the title from option 'A'.  All the
       sysops have been great with their mail to me about their subs.  Check
       the SUBS.LST, SUBS.1, and SUBS.2 files for your subs.  If you find an
       error, e-mail me quick. I will have the change in the next update.

SA... What procedure should they follow for hosting a new sub?

Odin:  First, check to make sure the sub doesn't already exist.  When 2 or
       more subs discuss the same topic, both lose potential subscribers.
       Second, use //BOARDEDIT to set up the sub.  Set the auto info and
       autorequest (except for adult subs) and select a category.  Third,
       e-mail me the information (include SUBTYPE, HOST, NOTES, and TITLE).
       Lastly, advertise the heck out of it!  It gets subscribers. By the
       way, picking an interesting name can lead to subscribers easier.

SA... Are there are problems arising that you would like to address?

Odin:  Again the 'O' option in boardedit.  Most of the time my program and I
       spend rejecting new "names" of peoples subs because they have put a
       description under the 'O' option.  I know it says description, but
       Wayne Bell wrote the software to use this for the pings, so bear with
       me.

SA... Many BBS's are still running 4.21a and earlier, should all subs still
have a numeric subtype?

Odin:  This has been a topic of discussion between Jim and I for a while.
       Both of us agree that it is better if everyone upgrades to 4.22.  It
       allows more flexibilty.  Right now, I have to deal with the alpha
       types and numeric types for the same sub.  It can get very confusing.
       The biggest problem with alpha types is that sysops have a tendency
       to use a type already in use.  Again, read the subs list first before
       choosing a name.

SA... It was brought to my attention that you are working on a program that
will print out on the hosts message base a list of subscribers to a hosted
sub, like WWIV Serv does, is this true and if so tell us about it. How does
it work and when will the public be able to use it?

Odin:  This program came from another program I wrote called FIXSUBS.  This
       new program is called SUBSCR(ibers).  It is currently in testing
       stages right now and will be available sometime around July 4th.
       Basically, it reads the node file and use the nodes and BBSLIST.* to
       get the board names and REGIONS.DAT to get the area.


SA...  Odin you have set up a sub that is for the subs list. What is the
purpose of this sub and who should subscribe to it?

Odin:  It is supposed to help sysops to contact me quickly.  No one has
       subscribed yet (guess I don't advertise too well.......).  Anyone can
       subscribe to it.  I can help with subtypes, names, etc....... It is a
       discussion forum also.  You can make comment, suggestions, and even
       gripes to me about the SUBSLIST.  So give it a try.


Odin:  Thanks for interview.  If anyone has a question, feel free to write.
       FIXSUBS is available for download here (we are an ISB and have ASV).
       SUBSCR will be available in beta form on July 4th.  A mod will also
       come with it.

The Following is a post that Odin sent to everyone concerning the subs.lst:

Attention all SysOp who host Subs for IceNET - from Odin (SLC)

     As the IceNET Subslist Coordinator, I was going through the SUBS.INF file
(the file created by Jim when he sends out "pings") and I have noticed a few
things that I would like to address.

     I would like all sysops who are currently hosting subs to check the
following information:

     1.  Check for duplicate sub types on your boards (there are a few)
     2.  Verify all your subs in the subs list.  Any discrepancies, please let
         me know.
     3.  next paragraph.

     The last thing I need for you to do is to check your //BOARDEDIT for each
of your subs.  There is a misleading menu command called  2'O': Description 1.
This really should be called SUBS.LST Sub Title.  When Jim does a "ping", this
ping searches a file called SUBS.XTR for the all the subs you host that have
the AUTO INFO set in the 'J' command.  The 'O' description will be the title
that you wish to have in the SUBS list.  If you leave it blank, then the 'A'
Title will be used.  Please refrain from using the 'O' to describe the sub.
Please place the title you wish to use in the subs list instead.

     Also, Jim and I have discussed a possible change in the CATEG.NET file.
The addition of categories, and the renaming of others is a possibility.  This
is not etched in stone though.  Also, the Highly Recommended category is only
for the National SysOp Sub.  I know all of you think that your subs should be
highly recommended (as do I), but then we would only need 1 category.  So I may
be renaming this category,  The National SysOp Category  (but I am not sure....).

     If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail.  Please check over
your subs and let me know..........

p.s.  If you wish to automate your subs to remove dropped nodes from the
      network, call my board and download a file called FIXSUBS.ZIP which will
      contain the method to automating your subs.

                              Some Basic WWIV

    WWIV. One thing for sure, it's versatile. In that versatility,
lies literally hundreds of thousands of possible mods, ranging from
simple prompt changes to the more involved mods such as the multi-line
mod or the message quoting enhancement. But all of them have one thing
in common, they rely on basic WWIV variables. So before we get too
involved in mods, I think we will hold back a bit and stick to the
tried-and-true basics.

                           Variable Basics

    It is vital to know all you can about the variables used in WWIV.
Each variable takes up precious space in your BBS's data area, and
duplicate variables can cause you endless headaches. So we should
start with some of the basic WWIV variables, the ones that any modder
should at least be aware of. The definitions for all of the global
WWIV variables are stored in VARS.H. This file contains variables that
are accessable to any function in your BBS. There are quite a few
variables in VARS.H, and we certainly can't cover them all, but I'd
like to highlight some of the special ones.

                             The Integers

checkit     1 if extended ASCII characters are acceptable from the
            keyboard or com port. 0 instructs WWIV to accept only the
            lower 128 characters.

curdloads   1 if the user is in the transfer section, 0 if the user is
            NOT in the transfer section. The 'T' command from the main
            menu simply sets curdloads to 1. The next time the main
            menu should be displayed, curdloads is checked, and the
            transfer area menu is displayed instead.

echo        1 if WWIV should echo characters to the com port, 0 if
            not. This feature is set for the entry of passwords.

hangup      A 1 indicates that WWIV should hangup the phone at it's
            earliest convenience; used commonly in the '/O' command.

helpl       The number stored in this variable indicates which help
            section should be displayed when Ctrl-O is pressed. The is
            the number stored in HELP.MSG, in the first column of a
            line of '=' characters.

hungup      1 if a user has hung up, 0 otherwise. This variable is
            normally set by a call to checkhangup().

lines_listed
            This varialbe contains the current number of lines that
            has been displayed on the user's screen (NOT THE SYSOP's,
            they can be different sizes!). When this value reaches
            the user's screenheight, a pause prompt is displayed.

net_num     The current network number, as stored in the 'N' setting
            in INIT. Remember 0 is the first net, 1 is the second,
            reguardless of the numbering systems you see anywhere else.

ok_modem_stuff
            Setting this variable indicates that WWIV should perform
            modem routines. If you start the BBS with the /M
            parameter, this value is 0.

topdata     The setting of this variable indicates which "topscreen" is
            displayed locally. 0 disables the display, 1 creates the
            system status display, and 2 creates the user status
            display.  To actually display the topscreen, a call to the
            topscreen() function is in order after setting this
            variable to the desired value.

useron      1 if a user is on the BBS, locally or remotely, 0
            otherwise.


                            A Lone Double

timeon      The number of seconds the user has been on.


                              Structures

    Which brings us to the meat of the variables, structures. There
are countless structures in WWIV, some of them large, and I won't go
into the data stored in these structures in detail here. Rather, I'll
give you a quick definition of what type of information they contain.
The word in parentheses below the structure name is the global
variable associated with the particular structure.

userrec     This structure contains user information for the
(thisuser)  current user.

configrec   Contains data from CONFIG.DAT, which defines the BBS
(syscfg)    configuration.

statusrec   Holds key data about the BBS, most of which changes
(status)    constantly. This structure is also used to store data from
            the BBS when external programs are running. It is written
            to disk before each external program call, and restored
            afterwards.

subboardrec
(subboards)
            Contains //BOAREDIT information about each sub, such as
            message file name, ARs, restrictions, etc.

directoryrec
(directories)
            Stores //DIREDIT information about each sub, such as
            storage directory, DARs, and other flags.

usersubrec  These structures hold the subboards and directories
(usub)      available for each user.  Note that not all subs and dirs
(udir)      are available to all users, so these structures are used
            as indexes to the actual sub number or directory number.
            (More on these in the future, I assure you.)

postrec     Contains data about each message or e-mail, such as
(msgs)      author, anonymous flags, etc.

modem_info  This structure stores modem setup strings, connection
(modem_i)   parameters and more, all taken from the settings in
            MODEMS.MDM.

net_networks_rec
(net_networks)
            This structure holds the INIT settings for each network
            your system is a member of, such as node number and
            directory.

wwiv_version
            While really a string, this variable holds the current
            WWIV version number, suitable for display.


                               Curtains

    Well, that's enough to chew on for the moment.  Some of the more
simple mods you'll find just display some of the variables I've
mentioned above, and I'm sure you got an idea or two about using them
to personalize your BBS.  But there are many others, so feel free to
poke around inside of VARS.H to see what you can find.

    And we'll talk again next month.

Note: I didn't write an SSM editor.  It would be pointless, since Tolkien has
already done an excellent job of writing one.  So don't make a mistake when
writing your SSM's unless you've got Tolkien's editor or don't care.

       Berea BBS      (716) 675-9384      IceNET Node  7671

                            West Seneca, NY


     Berea is currently operated on an 486 with 8 megabytes of memory,
120 Megabytes of hard disk storage, a CD-Rom Drive for downloading nearly
1 Gigabyte of Shareware programs.  Berea has a rotating CD-Rom Library which
changes monthly to offer a diversity of programs for downloading.  The CD's
include several Night Owl series, Two Pheonix series, and an Alpha and Omega.
Transmission is achieved through a US Robotics 9600 baud V.32 modem, with V.42
Berea currently uses registered WWIV 4.22 BBS software with personal
modifications, and Berea is Networked with the IceNET, WWIVnet, FishNET,
and MicroNET Networks.

     Berea was established March 17, 1987, on an Atari 8 Bit Computer.
It was later upgraded to an 8088 and then finally evolved to it's present
hardware configuration.

     Berea Hosts 3 IceNET subs;
        The Christian Issues Network   Subtype   7671
        Ambassadors For Christ         Subtype  17671
        Political Thought and Debate   Subtype  27671


When did you first start bbsing?

     I first started BBSing in January of 1985.  I was hesitent and unsure
of what the modem world would lead me to.  I called many BBSes and really
found many of them to be nothing more than war boards.


What caught your attention, that later made you decide to start your own BBS?

     Although I did not start this BBS, I soon found a comfortable place as
a user on Berea.  Berea was going through some changes and some rough times
as it's Sysops and Co-Sysops were not always present.  I, through the rough
times, made minor suggestions here and there.  I was later asked to assist in
the daily operations of the BBS.  Having only an Apple IIe to work with made
these tasks very cumbersome and difficult especially at 300 baud.  I soon
became a user of the IBM world and learned that the task of daily maintance
became enjoyable.

     The actual Sysop had become too busy to operate his own BBS, so
he turned over the complete operations of the system to myself.  I remember
my first experience as The Sysop when I logged on and found almost 200 pieces
of mail waiting for me.  Many of these were old, but it was my policy to
personally answer each and every piece of mail.


When did you join IceNET?

     I joined IceNET in December of 1992.


Why did you join IceNET?

     I wanted to join IceNET for quite sometime, I think what kept me from
joining was the fact of my failure to communicate and my own action of
jumping to conclusions.  I called many IceNET Boards and found them to be
of the Typical High School Sysop type.  There is nothing wrong with this
type of BBS, it just wasn't what I was looking for as an older Sysop.  It
was my conversations with Jim (1@1) and Special Agent (1@7672) which led
me to see that there was a diversity in IceNET just as in WWIVnet.  I then
without hesitation joined IceNET.


What is the theme or purpose of your BBS?

     Berea was established March 17, 1987, with the main intent to give an
open discussion for religion, and an open forum for Christian conversation.
As we all know, religious discussions are shunned from many of the local
boards.  The idea of Christ, in almost any form of conversation, is rejected
and shunned in today's fast paced society.  Berea was intended to break this
barrier and offer free speech to those who wish to participate in any of the
discussions.  Although Berea offers a forum for religious speech, it also
offers forums for other discussions as well.  These include Political,
Technical, as well as many others topics which may change from time to time.

     Berea, was named after the City of Berea in Macedonia (now called Verria
or Salonica).  The people of Berea were highly recognized and commended by The
Apostle Paul for their diligence in Seaching The Scriptures to see if what
they were being taught was truly in-line with The Written Word of God.  The
Bereans were recognized for their perseverance in upholding the Truth,
Standards, and Grace that God has set forth for all of mankind.


What makes your BBS different or unique from others?

     To parallel the Berean People, Berea offers an on-line Bible program
called "Godspeed" which allows the users to search and find any and all
occurrences of any word or phrase in The Bible.  Also on-line is a Concordance
and Lexicon program that will refer to any word in The Bible and give the user
the appropriate Hebrew/Greek word with the original definition when the verse
was written.  These are available as study helps in an effort to shed Light on
The Truth of The Word of God.  For home study Berea also has several on-line
Bible programs, such as "The On-line Bible" and "God's Word For Windows".
Berea also offers a reference library to Preachers, Pastors, Laymen, or
anyone who wishes to gain knowledge gleaned from The Bible.

Running a BBS takes much time and effort, what makes it worth it for you?

     Just the act of accomplishment make the task worthwhile.


     I also want to thank Jim (1@1) for his dedication to IceNET and WWIV
software.  He has made the Sysop's side of the BBS more enjoyable for us.
Jim's addition of the Multi-net Server has allowed me to pull several extra
message subs while at the same time it has also lowered my long distance
phone bill.  My personal thanks to Jim, his efforts, and his dedication
to IceNET.
