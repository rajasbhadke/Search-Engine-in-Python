To all of you who wanted to see the FNB history that I thought I had:
I had something a while ago that was issued by Boston FNB.  It seems
to have dissappeared, so I can't simply transcribe it into the
computer.  What follows is a quick summary, basically all that I can
remember about the history of FNB as it was told to me.
FNB began in boston around 1980.  It started as a food distribution
program, folks would pick up surplus food from various restaurants,
green grocers, and farmers markets and distribute it to soup
kitchens.  Eventually these people began feeding the homeless
themselves.  FNB believes that homelessness exists because of our
society and government, that there will always be homeless if our
priorities do not change.  FNB chapters now exist in a number of
different cities, on a nationwide level we are only loosely
affiliated.  We only serve vegetarian meals, and the serving is
usually done in some kind of political manner (in front of city hall,
at demonstrations, etc.)
This is a quick, and surely incomplete summary.  Local groups are
welcome to add on additions or corrections.  My apologies for the
spelling, I am typing this quickly.
