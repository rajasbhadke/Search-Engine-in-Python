---[Crypt ]------------------------------------------------------------------

Though the Crypt BBS is relatively new on the block, only having been
around the past two years, our users say that it is the best BBS in
the area.. The Crypt is not the largest, (YET but will be soon) but it
does have a LOT to offer it's callers.. We have more then 11,000 files
on line for those with regular AND adult access.. We offer 20+ doors
(some for subscribers only)
including;

L.O.R.D, Global Wars, SkyMountain, The Pit, and many more

Over the winter a survey was done to find the most popular doors in the nation
according to users of BBSes.. The Crypt carries them all, and then some..

Our file bases consist of two CD-ROMs plus local areas.. They include GAMES,
WINDOWS, OS/2, BBS related areas, ADULT oriented covering all life styles,
and much, much more.. (All areas are open to callers except adult..upon
validation)

Message bases are very plentifull on the Crypt as well, and cover any
and all possible topics.. We currently carry local, national, and
international networks for our users.. (And HUB them if you would like them
for your BBS, no cost sharing presently..) These networks include:

CNY_net------> Local Utica, Rome network, general topics..
SAC_net------> Southern Alleghany Computer Network, National, general topics.
SL_net ------> Searchlight Network, International, any topics possible..
FIDO   ------> Netmail and local echos only..
THROBnet ----> Adult oriented, all lifestyles, International..

Though the Crypt has gone to a subscription basis, free access is available
to all callers.. For those who want to benefit by all of what the Crypt has
to offer, it can be done for as little as $10/year and up.. (We also run
specials on occasion making it an even better deal for our users..)

Next time your looking through your dialing directory for a BBS to call,
remember this.. The Crypt isn't the biggest, we don't have a lot of callers,
but what we do have is a LOT to offer those who take advantage of it..
The Crypt's basic theme is quality, not quantity.. Our users tell us that
it's by far the best BBS in the area.. Parents love it because thier kids
can call and play games, and not be exposed to any adult or off color
language, games, or files.. Adults love it because they can act and play like
adults without worrying about kids showing up where they don't belong..

You really should give us a call and see for yourself what a quality board
has to offer you.. And remember to take advantage of the 843-6537 line if your
calling from the Utica or Oneida area.. (sorry, can't help those from Rome yet
with local access, but am working on it..
