When this universal law of equity rises up in every man and woman, then none shall
lay claim to any creature and say, This is mine, and that is yours.  This is my
work, that is yours.  But everyone shall put their hands to till the earth and
bring up cattle, and the blessing of the earth shall be common to all; when a man
hath need of any corn or cattle, take from the next storehouse he meets with. 
There shall be no buying or selling, no fairs or markets, but the whole earth shall
be a common treasury for every man, for the earth is the Lord's...When a man hath
eat, and drink, and clothes, he hath enough.  

Gerrard Winstanley, 'The New Law of Righteousness'.
