     Does anyone have the number for the Deathstar????  Thanx for all the
response everyone's been giving on Apple BBS numbers!!!!!  By the way, does
anyone have a newer version of DDD????  I'm willing to trade anything to get
a copy!!!!!  One little reminder here, call Alien Nation at 313-487-8448 and

It is in Michigan. It is the home of the First Class cracking group. It gets
all the wares the fastest because it is recognized as the best bbs in the
country. All the major pirates are on it. You can't get on it. I tried for a
long time and gave up. Good luck!!!
The number is 313-261-1968 if you want to try!!!

It might be the best in Michigan, maybe even in the Eastern half of the US...
But not in the country...I don't care if Apple Jack himself was on it...

Gimme a break
 On the Deathstar, you need a 2500 modem and you have to get special access.
Also, does anyone have any good Apple BBS numbers with good U/D's.
Thanx
