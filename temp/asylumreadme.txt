Introduction to the Asylum solution:

I think a lot of people have found Asylum to be a baffling experience. The game is by no means 
outstanding, but it does hold a kind of fascination.
Agreed, there is way too much pointless wandering around, and the game does have its share of 
questionable puzzles. However, what annoys most people is - I believe - those diabolical mazes. So 
I hope that the maps will clear up things for you!
Naturally, there is also a step-by-step solution.

This file will explain how to use the maps and give you a few hints for the game itself. 
Please refer to the file Asylum_solve.txt for the full solution.

A lot of thanks must go to Paul D. Doherty for the original maps.

NOTES:
1. All doors are marked with a straight line. Most of them lead to a room.
2. Most rooms are empty. The important ones have numbers
3. Your starting location is in room #1
4. Cards needed:
	Map 1: 	Credit card for all doors except the ones with 3 lines - 
		for those you need the gold card.
		In area C you need the silver card.
	Map 2: 	Gold card for all the doors.
	Map 3-5:Platinum card for all doors.

5. Shaded areas are teleport areas. They are impossible to map, so just
avoid them!
6. Don't keep to many doors open at any given time. Five doors maximum!
7. Part one of the game only takes place on maps 1 and 2.


Enjoy!
