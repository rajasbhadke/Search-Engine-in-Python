        Welcome to The Consultants' Exchange Guest Account.

The guest account allows you to have a look around the system, and get
a taste of what Unix is like.  It has become necessary to restrict some of
the commands, but 99% of them are available to you; for example:

        readnews                        Read the USENET articles
        pg /bbs/bbs/info/*              Will display the latest Info digests
        cat filename                    Will display the contents of a file
        ls -l directory-name            Lists the contents of a directory 
        xmodem s path/file-name         Sends you a file with Xmodem protocol


Unix Commands Compared to PC-DOS:

   EVERYTHING is lower case.  Case sensitivity is always a concern.
   Ctrl-C     =    Del (ASCII 127)      Interrupt program execution
   Ctrl-BREAK =    Ctrl-\ (ASCII 28)    Emergency Escape
   DIR        =    ls -l        Directory listing of files in current directory
   TYPE       =    cat          Display contents of a file
   \          =    /            The directory delimiter is the FORWARD slash
   Ctrl-D (^D) to disconnect (log-out)
        
File Transfers: 
        Xmodem checksum:
                xmodem s path/filename          Sends file to you from conexch
                xmodem r path/filename          Receives file sent by you 
        Xmodem crc:
                sz -X path/filename             Sends file to you from conexch
                rz -c path/filename             Receives file sent by you
                rz -? or sz -?                  Help message
        Ymodem:
                sb path/filename                Sends all files that match 
                                                filename.  * ok.
                rb path/filename                Receives all files you send
        Zmodem:
                sz                              Like Ymodem above
                rz                                "     "     "

        You'll find the files for Unix systems located in
        /usr3/public, and the PC-DOS files in
        /bbs/bbs/msdos or /bbs/bbs/uploads, Etc.

Enjoy.
