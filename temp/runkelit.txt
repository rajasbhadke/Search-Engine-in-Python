THE FOLLOWING IS A SATYRICAL ATTACK
DIRECTED TO A FEW SELECT PIRATES IN 
THE APPLE PIRATE WORLD. 

CIRCLE OF DENEB/CIRCLE OF DICKS/
CIRCLE OF DWEEBS (IN CASE YOU MISSED
OUT)

DEFINITION:
CIRCLE-A PLANE OF FIGURES BOUNDED
BY EVERY POINT WHIC IS EQUALLY DIST-
-ANT FROM A FIXED POINT CALLED THE 
CENTER.
OF-PREPOSITION, FROM, AMONG.
DENEB-BRIGHTEST STAR IN THE CONST-
-ELLATION CYGNUS. 

PUT THEM TOGETHER...MAKES A LOT OF
SENSE, EH?  I GUESS THE BOY! GOT 
DESPERATE FOR A NAME WHEN HIS GROUP
FINALLY FOUND A LAME EXCUSE OF A 
WARE CALLED IKARI WARRIORS WITH A
PROTECTION SCHEME ON IT THAT WAS
EASY ENOUGH FOR HIS SIMPLETON MIND
TO DEFEAT.  A RENNAISANCE OF THE
STRATA-CRACKERS PERHAPS?

PEACEFROG.  YOU MOTHER-LESS FUCK.
WHERE IS THEXDER //E?

CRASHER.  YOU FLAMMING FAGGOT.
YOUR EGO IS ABOUT AS INFLATED AS
THE LATE ORSON WELL'S BELLY.
LEARN HOW TO CRACK.

TONY/HIGH V.  YOU FASCIST SCUM.

DISKMASTER.  YOU TALK TOO MUCH 
ABOUT TOO LITTLE.

BRIAN FIST.  GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD
RUBBISH.  HMM, WHY DID YOU LEAVE
THE APPLE PIRATE COMMUNITY?
YOUR PRESENCE MADE A GOOD TOPIC OF
CONVERSATION. 

THE MARTYR (MR. HITMAN FOR HIRE).
PLEASE, FIND MY TRUE IDENTITY AND
THREATEN ME 'REVENGE'.  I COULD USE
A GOOD LAUGH.  THE ONLY INGENUITY
THIS IDIOT POSSESSES IS GETTING MY
PHONE NUMBER AND TURNING IT INTO A
20 MEG BBS.  GET REAL.

TO YOU PEOPLE THAT CALL YOURSELVES
'PIRATES' AND CAN'T PROGRAM WORTH
DIDDLY-FUCK.  YOU ARE AN INSULT TO
THE COMPUTER MOVEMENT.

WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE DOC.

GLENN.  YOU POMPOUS, ARROGANT SCUM.
YOU RUN A BOARD FALLING UNDER THE
CLASSIFICATION OF A SUBJECT ON 
WHICH YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT.
PROGRAMMING.  LEARN HOW TO BOOT
UP A SECTOR EDITOR FOR CHRIST'S
SAKE, YOU SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT ON
THE PHONE.  AND QUIT RUNNING TO
HANSEL EVERYTIME YOU NEED HELP ON
SOMETHING TO DO WITH PROGRAMMING,
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE PIRATE WORLD 
FOR 4 TO 5 YEARS NOW, GET OFF YOUR
LOUSY ASS AND DO SOMETHING WORTH-
-WHILE WITH THAT COMPUTER.

THIS CONCLUDES MY COMMENTARY, I 
HOPE YOU HAVE FOUND IT ENJOYABLE
AND ENTERTAINING.

 "Hey Bart, whats up dude?" - SA

 "Not much man, did you see my .45 mag, man?" - TT

 "Hey I gotta a RAD idea. Lets call and rag on someone tonight. Wanna?" - SA

 "Okaaay man, I will get my hand gun out of the big truck. one sec." - TT

  <<Making sounds like loading a gun.>>

 "All set Dave. Ready? Ohha, I feel soo rad doing this. And they, haha, don't
know who it is? We are sooooooo tough, huh man?" - TT

 "Ahhhh, I gotta it. We can call Necromancer. He will never know, guh? No! I
gotta a better idea, I will get the userlist from red-sector-a, and call up
some poor suckers. Good idea Bart?" - SA

 "Yea, but can we kill on of them?!?!?! Huh!?!?!" - TT

 "Okay, but only one sweety." - SA

 "Oh RAD, someone acccctually calling my awEs0me board man. Its neveeer busy.
I gotta see this. Maybe I can kill them.... hajahaja" - TT

<--->

  I don't know but Dave has always been a STUCK up asshole in my opinion.
He thinks he is so k-rad elite. I haven't seen him do anything for CTC, I
mean at all. Shit, he doesn't distibute, crack or run a board. What good is
he?
  He just likes to get people on his three way and rag on dudes. Him and his
butt buddies Bart, James and who ever else. All does is hang around calling
them and ragging on people. I don't think he ever sleeps, his life is one big
RAG file. Man, I though dAArk L0gic was bad, looks at this poor excuse for
a group.

 "Duh MAN, we are awesome at double releases!!! That turn out to be bad
FUCKING cracks anyway. Touch Tone thinks he can crack, but all he can do
is flunk out of Special Education classes. Thats real hard to do. " - an
insider of CtC.

 Hell, no wonder Necromancer left for First Class, a useless group he
was in before. Making his system look like shit. Now the only one making it
look bad is BIG BOY Davey. (remember, the "stuck-up" one. Haha)

 Anyway, the only good groups are First Class and DG, so why don't the rest
of you fucks get out. (well, TriTOOOOn does run DG. He has the $$$. Him
and his little girly friend Tony.) That means SA and CtC should hit the road.

 Personally Dave is a homeboy and should be shot. Probably a mistake on his
mothers part. And absolutly a mistake in the modem world. So!! Dave (prick)
take off and stop ragging on flys walking up your drapes.

<-->

 All Barty boy is good for saying he has a gun and getting kicked out of
good 'ole special Ed., come and get me dewd. Hehe, with your wild .44
Magnum. Start loading now man, its going to be a good one. (fargin jerkoff)

<-->

 "Okay lets go, I know who we can call Game Warden. I love ragging on him
even though I more of a poor slob than he is, eh Bart?" - SA

 "GO! Get your rad three way going. Duh! What is three way anyways dude?" -
TT

  <beep><beep><beep>

  <ring..>

 "HEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!" - GW

 "Is Harry there?" - SA

 "Its not Harry you dumb fuck, its John. Duh" - TT

 "Ops, I mean John. heeeehheee" - SA

 "Noooooooooooooooooooo, John lives here man. But I can get you a couple
40 meg hard drives, for nothing??"

 <click>

 "Haha, we showed him dude, huh?" - SA

 "Uh huh? I gotttttaaa get my gun. I mother is playing with it. Oh my gawd,
my father so my report card, shit. Gotta go.."
