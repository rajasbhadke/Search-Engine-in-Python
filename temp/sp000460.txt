        SMALL PASTORAL DISPLACED

                   1
                Introit

Our gold
         not common
gold as light
              in noble frame
the window gold
                it catches
from the east
              the window's light
is in the west
               at morning
from the west
              the evening light
is east.
         We see it
as an eye's catch
not to possess
               we cannot
further than the rainbow
foot that holds the span
an arch
        our gold
is common
          to the elements
not common gold
                as rain
in fire
        in earth
in air and water
Symbol    Sulfur
and elixir     .

           Idyll

deflected light

         Intermezzo

So rarely rain
               these years
                           with the sound's
percussive fall
                the seethe
a water stopped
                along the eves
a quiet house
              try evening the measure
                                      that
the house is glad
it might be
            as the presence
in the house
             is of its measure
gladness.
          So rarely
these years
the light's reflection
                        gild of panes
the morning and the evening
                            were
the same
         of the same day
clearing of storm
clouds's interference
                      lessens
                              washed a gold
not common
           goodwill
                    upsprung
the deed
the word
         impressive
so rare
         fire to seethe
the room's      uncommon gold


             4
           Scherz

Set the branch
say out no way
no saying
          turn about
drip water
           over fall
an    even swaying
let it be   a dancer
legs at scissor
                bend
how the branch
                might fall
come uppance
              clear to be
the shadow
             still no way.


             5

Just as the oars lie hushed above the water
so the water quitted below the lapstrake hull
where shadow flattens   wave along the drift
not always memory     the surge is on
slips   oil   the trace a little closer
wake that stirs   a hand in tending
balanced that the oars are ready
should a wind arise and break this dream
the landfall shore is raised a bit
to ride the sea and all outriders rigged
the news    a bird's cry following
on doom of bell     the steadied buoy
above the shoal    and sun to rise again
the gilded windows     island homestead
stead the house     to follow there the drifting.

          Recitative

     Suffer an elixir that the gild is common     oh uncommon 
gold     the window is the best as seen at distance     house of 
the golden windows     wind's eye open to a sweep of air that 
dries what is not past the water    eye will lighten it


              7
             Air

Like a bell
            a bell
its own likeness
                  tuned
the metal
          felt the stop
the wave
         long stopping
ursprach
          upsprung
the gold in
            lightness
how a bell
           is like
it fastens
            on the dome of air
down
      and farther
down


             8
       Leading Tones

elixir
       common
is uncommon
gild
the window
at a distance
pane of east
or of west
sea mew
calling
over island
once said
unspoken
raise to horizon
time ripened
the bell
at angle
follows wake
in furrow
a loneliness
that sound
of doing
light essence
gold or sulfur



         9
     Resolution

Let it not
           impersonal
flare  of lightness
                    not common
gold    as light
                 the noble frame
of window
          gold
                caught east and west
morning and evening
                    of the day
the same
         percussive
wavelength
           lap of bell
washed     a gold
not common
           rainbow arch
an arch as rain in fire
earth in water
symbol elixir
gold and sulfur
eye caught
           iris moon
silence
        hull and drift
steadied buoy to shore
hush of water drip
Let it not
            impersonal
let it
        not impersonal
light from window
                   unto window
gild a day
           another
as another day.
