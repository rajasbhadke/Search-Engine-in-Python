                            ZORK III

     WELL, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE YOU FIRST STOOD BY THE MAILBOX OUTSIDE
THE HOUSE IN THE FOREST. YOU'VE DEFEATED THE THIEF, OUTWITTED THE WIZARD OF
FROBOZZ, AND NOW, YOU STAND AT THE FOOT OF THE ENDLESS STAIRS, READY TO EMBARK
ON THE FINAL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY. SO, PICK UP THE LAMP, TURN IT ON, AND HEAD
ALONG DUE SOUTH UNTIL YOU COME TO THE SHORE OF THE LAKE.
     DROP THE LAMP <SAY GOODBYE TO IT; YOU WON'T BE SEEING IT AGAIN>, AND JUMP
INTO THE LAKE. BRRRR!!! PRETTY COLD! SO, DON'T STAY IN THERE LONG; SWIM WEST
AND THEN GO SOUTH INTO THE SCENIC VISTA. KIND OF A STRANGE PLACE, WITH CHANGING
NUMBERS ON THE WALL AND A BARE TABLE...NOT QUITE ALL THAT SCENIC, EH?
     WELL, GET THE TORCH, AND WAIT FOR THE NUMBER TO CHANGE TO "II." THEN,
TOUCH THE TABLE. MY OH MY! YOU'RE IN A ROOM FROM ZORK II...ROOM 8, AS A MATTER
OF FACT. HOWEVER, YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO SIGHT-SEE, SO GET THE CAN OF GRUE
REPELLANT, THEN TRY MOVING EAST, AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF BACK IN SCENIC
VISTA AGAIN. NOW WAIT FOR THE NUMBER TO CHANGE TO "III," THEN TOUCH THE TABLE
AGAIN. THIS TIME, YOU'RE IN A DAMP PASSAGE. DROP THE TORCH, AND JUST WAIT
THERE UNTIL YOU'RE PULLED BACK TO SCENIC VISTA.
     OKAY, YOU'RE FINISHED HERE, SO MOVE ALONG NORTH TO THE SHORE, AND AGAIN
JUMP IN THE LAKE. SPLASH! IT HASN'T GOTTEN ANY WARMER; IN FACT, YOU JUST
DROPPED THE CAN OF REPELLANT. SO, GO DOWN, AND YOU WILL BE ON THE LAKE BOTTOM.
AH, THERE IT IS! BUT, COULD THERE BE SOMETHING ELSE THERE, TOO? "GET ALL,"
AND YOU WILL HAVE NOT ONLY THE REPELLANT BUT ALSO AN AMULET. THIS IS ONE OF
THOSE "WONDERFUL" VARIABLE THINGS; IT MAY TAKE MORE THAN ONE TRY ON YOUR PART
TO GET BOTH ITEMS. IN THE MEANTIME, YOU CAN'T STAY IN THE ICY WATERS TOO LONG,
AND SOONER OR LATER A HUNGRY FISH WILL COME LOOKING FOR YOU.
     THEREFORE, IT'S BEST TO SAVE THE GAME BEFORE YOU JUMP IN FROM THE WESTERN
SHORE. SO IF YOU DIE IN THE WATER, OR GET EATEN BY THE FISH, OR PICKED UP BY
THE ROC <WHILE YOU'RE SWIMMING ON THE SURFACE>, YOU DON'T HAVE TO START ALL
THE WAY BACK AT THE BEGINNING. BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE ZORKS
WHERE YOU DON'T LOSE POINTS IF YOU DIE. BUT, ALL THE ITEMS YOU'VE COLLECTED SO
FAR GET SCATTERED ALL AROUND, AND IT'S TIME-CONSUMING TO GO LOOK FOR THEM.
     OKAY, NOW YOU HAVE THE CAN AND THE AMULET, SO HEAD UP TO THE SURFACE, THEN
SOUTH TO THE SOUTHERN SHORE. YOU CAN SEE A CAVE TO THE SOUTH, AND IT LOOKS
KIND OF DARK. IN FACT, IT *IS* DARK IN THERE, WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE THE
REPELLANT. SO, SPRAY THE SMELLY STUFF ON YOURSELF, AND GO SOUTH, AND YOU WILL
FIND YOURSELF IN A DARK PLACE. GO SOUTH AGAIN, THEN EAST, AND YOU WILL BE IN
THE KEY ROOM. WHEW! AT LEAST THERE'S SOME LIGHT IN HERE! AND BY THE LIGHT YOU
CAN SEE A STRANGE KEY. GET THE KEY, THEN MOVE THE MANHOLE COVER AND GO DOWN.
AND HERE YOU ARE ON AN AQUEDUCT. SINCE YOU CAN'T GO BACK <THE GRUE REPELLANT
WOULDN'T HAVE LASTED THAT LONG>, YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO FORWARD. SO, JUST HEAD
ALONG NORTH AND YOU WILL COME TO THE WATER SLIDE. GO NORTH DOWN THE SLIDE,
AND GUESS WHERE YOU ARE? IN THE DAMP PASSAGE! AND THERE'S THE TORCH, SO PICK
IT UP, BECAUSE YOU'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO NEED A LIGHT SOURCE...ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU THINK OF WHERE YOU'RE GOING NEXT. SO, FROM THE DAMP PASSAGE HIKE ALONG
WEST TO THE JUNCTION <YOU CAN'T GET THE SWORD OUT OF THE ROCK, SO DON'T EVEN
TRY>, THEN SOUTH INTO CREEPY CRAWL, AND SOUTHWEST INTO THE SHADOW LAND. HERE
WE COME TO ANOTHER VARIABLE PORTION OF THE GAME. YOU WILL HAVE TO WANDER AROUND
IN THE SHADOW LAND UNTIL A CLOAKED AND HOODED FIGURE APPEARS. WHEN THAT
HAPPENS, THE SWORD WILL SUDDENLY MATERIALIZE IN YOUR HAND, AND YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO FIGHT. HOWEVER, SINCE THERE'S NO WAY OF TELLING WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN, YOU
JUST HAVE TO KEEP MOVING AROUND UNTIL IT DOES. AT LEAST YOU WILL GET A CHANCE
TO PRACTICE SOME ELEMENTARY MAP-MAKING! ALSO, THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS PART
OF THE GAME, AS THE FIGURE IS QUITE CAPABLE OF KILLING YOU, TOO!
     SO, BEST TO SAVE BEFORE YOU ENTER SHADOW LAND. WHEN THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE
FINALLY APPEARS, ATTACK HIM WITH YOUR SWORD UNTIL HE IS BADLY WOUNDED AND
CANNOT DEFEND HIMSELF. AT THAT POINT, GET HIS HOOD. THE FIGURE WILL THEN
DISAPPEAR, LEAVING THE CLOAK BEHIND. GET THAT ALSO.  NOW, YOU HAVE TO GET OUT
OF HERE, AND I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW, SINCE THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING
EXACTLY WHERE YOU WERE WHEN THE FIGHT STARTED. HOWEVER, IF YOU GO EASTWARDS,
YOU WILL EXIT THE SHADOW LAND AT EITHER THE CREEPY CRAWL OR THE FOGGY ROOM.
FROM EITHER PLACE, GO NORTH TO THE JUNCTION. FROM THE JUNCTION, IT'S WEST
THROUGH THE BARREN AREA, AND WEST AGAIN TO THE CLIFF.  BET YOU JUST CAN'T WAIT
TO CLIMB DOWN THE ROPE, HUH? WELL, PICK UP THE BREAD FIRST, THEN GO DOWN TO THE
LEDGE. WELL, WELL, A CHEST! TOO BAD YOU DON'T HAVE A KEY TO OPEN IT. IN FACT,
THERE'S NO WAY FOR YOU TO OPEN IT AT ALL. BUT DON'T DESPAIR, THERE'S A WAY OF
DOING IT. JUST WAIT AROUND AND SOMEONE WILL COME ALONG THE TOP OF THE CLIFF.
YOU MAY NOT REALLY TRUST HIM, BUT TIE THE ROPE TO THE CHEST WHEN HE ASKS, AND
WAIT AROUND SOME MORE. EVENTUALLY, HE WILL RETURN AND HELP YOU BACK UP THE
CLIFF. HE WILL ALSO GIVE YOU A STAFF, WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE REALLY AFTER HERE.
TAKE THE STAFF, THEN GO BACK DOWN TO THE LEDGE, AND FROM THERE, TO THE CLIFF
BASE. NOW TREK SOUTH TO THE FLAT HEAD OCEAN, AND DO A LITTLE MORE WAITING.
SOONER OR LATER A SHIP WILL COME FLOATING BY. AS SOON AS YOU SEE IT, SAY:
"HELLO, SAILOR." THE MAN IN THE SHIP WILL THROW SOMETHING ONTO THE BEACH FOR
YOU. TAKE A LOOK, AND YOU WILL SEE IT'S A VIAL. IT'LL COME IN HANDY LATER, SO
PICK IT UP. NOW COMES THE FUN PART: YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE EARTHQUAKE
<NOTICE HOW YOU'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WAITING AROUND? I HOPE YOU'RE A PATIENT
PERSON!>.
     WHILE YOU'RE WAITING, YOU MIGHT WANT TO WANDER AROUND A LITTLE, ALTHOUGH
YOU'VE BEEN TO MOST OF THE ACCESSIBLE PLACES BY NOW. IN ANY CASE, WHEREVER YOU
ARE, ONCE THE EARTHQUAKE HITS, MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE CREEPY CRAWL, AND FROM
THERE EAST INTO THE TIGHT SQUEEZE, THEN EAST AGAIN INTO THE CRYSTAL GROTTO.
THEN ALL THE WAY SOUTH TO THE GREAT DOOR, AND EAST INTO THE MUSEUM ENTRANCE.
     NOW, OPEN THE EAST DOOR, THEN GO NORTH INTO THE MUSEUM. LOOK AT THE GOLD
MACHINE <IT'S A TIME MACHINE, IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING>, THEN SET THE DIAL
TO 776. HERE COMES THE FUN PART: PUSH THE MACHINE SOUTH INTO THE ENTRANCE,
THEN EAST INTO THE JEWEL ROOM. GET INTO THE MACHINE, AND PUSH THE BUTTON. AHA!
NOW YOU'RE BACK IN 776 GUE, BUT THE TIME MACHINE SEEMS TO HAVE VANISHED! NO
MATTER, WAIT FOR THE GUARDS TO LEAVE, THEN GET THE RING <AND *ONLY* THE RING!>,
THEN OPEN THE DOOR, GO OUT INTO THE ENTRANCE, OPEN THE NORTH DOOR AND GO NORTH.

BY GOLLY, THE MACHINE IS RIGHT THERE! PUT THE RING UNDER THE SEAT, TURN THE
DIAL TO 948, GET IN, AND PUSH THE BUTTON. WHEW, YOU'RE BACK IN THE RIGHT TIME
PERIOD AGAIN. GET OUT OF THE MACHINE, LOOK UNDER THE SEAT <YOU WILL GET THE
RING AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU DO THIS>, THEN BACK SOUTH, AND SOUTH AGAIN, TO THE
ROYAL PUZZLE. OKAY FOLKS, YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE ABSOLUTE NASTIEST PART OF
THE GAME. YOU MUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS *EXACTLY* AS GIVEN, OR YOU WILL
NEVER GET OUT. AND, SINCE IT WOULD BE EASY TO MAKE A MISTAKE HERE, I STRONGLY
RECOMMEND YOU SAVE THE GAME.
1. GO DOWN THE HOLE, THEN PUSH THE SOUTH WALL. THEN GO EAST, SOUTH, EAST,
   EAST. PUSH THE SOUTH WALL, GET THE BOOK, AND PUSH THE SMUTH WALL AGAIN.
2. PUSH THE WEST WALL TWICE. THEN GO EAST, SOUTH, AND PUSH THE EAST WALL.
3. NOW, GO STRAIGHT NORTH UNTIL YOU COME TO THE MARBLE WALL, AND PUSH THE
   EAST WALL.
4. NOW, GO WEST, SOUTH, SOUTH, SOUTH, SOUTH, EAST, EAST, NORTH, NORTH, NORTH,
   AND PUSH THE WEST WALL.
5. FROM THERE, GO EAST, SOUTH, SOUTH, SOUTH, WEST, WEST, WEST, WEST, NORTH,
   NORTH, NORTH, WEST, NORTH. PUSH THE EAST WALL THREE TIMES.
6. NOW, WEST, WEST, SOUTH, SOUTH, EAST, EAST, SOUTH, AND PUSH THE EAST WALL.
7. OKAY, NOW WEST, WEST, WEST, NORTH, NORTH, NORTH, EAST, EAST, AND
