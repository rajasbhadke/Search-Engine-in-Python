                        Compiled By The E.G. Smith Collective

                                       INTRODUCTION
                                       ------------
                                                   
     The purpose of this pamphlet isn't to preach about why you shouldn't
     eat animals and how animals are tortured because of societies
     consumption of them.  It has been compiled as a working reference for
     those who are most likely vegan, and who wonder if  Dihydroxyethyl
     Soyamine Dioleate in their favorite potato chips is vegan (which it
     isn't).
     
     This pamphlet is comprised of several different articles from all
     over the country.  There where a lot of things that we had collected
     that we wanted to include but due to the space constraints we where
     forced to carefully select articles that stayed consistent with the
     original goal we had set out to accomplish.
     
     The Possible Animal Derived List in this pamphlet requires some
     explanation.  This is a myriad of ingredients that fit into two
     categories.  The first, are ingredients that are most likely
     animal-derived, but no confirmation has been given by the
     manufacture(s). The other are ingredients that in some cases are
     animal-derived, but not always.  Usually it is best to use you're
     best judgement.  Lecithin for example will say Soy-Lecithin if it is
     not derived from animals, on the other hand some ingredients offer no
     clue to their origins.  It is usually best to avoid most of the
     products listed in this section, just to be safe.
     
     The booklet focuses mainly on food, but it also extends somewhat into
     shampoos and other products that even people of the meat-eating
     culture wouldn't normally eat.  We have tried to be as thorough and
     correct as possible, all the information contained in this
     publication is from reliable sources, all of which are documented at
     the end, and most have been double checked with our own resources. 
     If you find any additions or corrections please direct them to E.G.
     Smith Press, P.O. Box 02026, Columbus, Ohio, 43202 -- please include
     sources and explanations.

     without food or water in extreme heat and cold.  Legs are broken,
     eyes injured, etc.  Sheep are bred to be unnaturally woolly. 
     Inferior sheep are killed.  Shearing DOES hurt the sheep.  They are
     pinned down violently, sheared roughly.  Their skin is cut up.  Every
     year, hundreds of thousands of shorn sheep die from exposure to cold.
      Natural predators of sheep (wolves, coyotes, eagles, etc.) are
     poisoned, trapped and shot.  In the USA, overgrazing by cattle and
     sheep is turning more than 150 million acres of land into desert. 
     "Natural" wool raising uses enormous amounts of resources and energy
     (to breed, raise, feed, shear, transport, slaughter, etc. the sheep).
     Many people are allergic to wool.   Alternatives: cotton, cotton
     flannel, linen, man made fibers, etc.

     In the January/February 1995 issue of Animal Times-PETA's bimonthly
     magazine there is a list of "cruelty-free beers."  The following is
     direct quotation: "The following brewing companies have assured PETA
     in writing that all their various beers are made without
     animal-derived ingredients, additives, or processing agents:

     All German beers are winners, because all are vegan.  Bavarian purity
     laws limitthem to 4 ingredients only:  water, grain, hops and yeast."
     
     Also:  "Among the breweries making vegan nonalcoholic beer are Miller
     (Sharp's), Heileman (Kingsbury), and Anheuser-Busch (O'Doul's Premium
     Non-Alcoholic Brew)."
