t <-- dispatches kc 707 fuel plane. use       this only when your fuel supply         is running low. a funny little          blip will sound, other than that,       nothing happens, when in                actuality, it is docking with you       and returning home. this feature        may only be used once per wave,         so use it wisely.

/ <-- panic button. use this if too 
      many enemy planes are attacking.        alerts all bases, destroying all        enemies currently on the screen.
      this feature may only be used 
      once per wave, but you get to 
      keep them for future rounds if 
      they were not used.

b <-- puts you into monitor.

after a wave is completed, you recieve
bonus points for however many ally bases are still intact. after all bonus points have been tallied, your fuel tank will be filled, you will recieve and extra panic warhead, and a flashing 'ready' will appear on the screen. hit return, and the game will proceed with the next wave of enemy planes.
