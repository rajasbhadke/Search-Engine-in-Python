GAUGE DESCRIPTIONS:

     NOW YOU MUST LOAD THE GAME AND LOOK AT THE GAUGE SCREEN.

     IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER THERE IS A DIAL WITH ONE 0 ON IT. THIS IS THE BATTERY CHARGE LEVEL. BATTERIES ARE NECESSARY FOR SUBMERGING AND CRUISING ON SURFACE. THEY ARE GOOD FOR ABOUT 1 HOUR OF HIGH SPEED MOVEMENT, UP TO 6 HOURS AT L
OW SPEEDS.ON THE SURFACE, THEY GRADUALLY RECHARGE THEMSELVES.

     DIRECTLY BENEATH THIS GAUGE THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS. THE LEFT WILL LIGHT UP WHEN THE BATTERY IS BEING CHARGED. THE RIGHT WILL LIGHT UP WHEN THE BATTERY IS BEING DRAINED.

     TO THE RIGHT OF THE BATTERY GAUGE IS ANOTHER DIAL WITH NUMBERS FROM 0 TO 15 ON IT. THIS IS THE SPEED IN KNOTS THE SUB IS TRAVELLING. 20 KNOTS IS MAXIMUM SPEED ON SURFACE, WHILE 10 IS MAXIMUM UNDERWATER.

     TO THE RIGHT OF THIS IS A DIAL WITH NUMBERS FROM 0 TO 300 ON IT. THIS IS YOUR DEPTH IN FEET FROM THE SURFACE. THE 'P' INDICATES YOUR PERISCOPE LEVEL (44 FEET). THE SCOPE WILL NOT OPERATE BENEATH THE 'P'.

     TO THE RIGHT OF THE DEPTH GAUGE IS A BOX SHOWING TORPEDOS. IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER OF THIS BOX IS THE PERISCOPE INDICATOR. BLACK MEANS IT'S DOWN, GREEN MEANS UP. THE TORPEDOS IN THE BOX INDICATE WHICH OF THE 10 TORPEDO TUBES ARE 
READY TO FIRE. GREEN MEANS READY, BLACK MEANS RE-LOADING. IT TAKES ABOUT 10 GAME MINUTES TO RE-LOAD A TUBE.THE NUMBERS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS BOX INDICATE HOW MANY TORPEDOS ARE LEFT IN ADDITION TO THE ONES ALREADY LOADED.

     BENEATH THE BATTERY GAUGE (ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN) THERE IS A BOX WITH THREE VERTICAL ROWS OF LIGHTS. THIS IS THE FUEL GAUGE. AS YOU USE FUEL THE TANKS FILL UP WITH WATER. THE FUEL FLOATS ON TOP. THE LIGHTS INDICATE YOUR FUEL A
ND WATER LEVEL IN EACH OF THE THREE TANKS. BLACK= FUEL LEVEL, WHITE= WATER LEVEL. FULL FUEL TANKS CAN LAST 50-60 DAYS.

     TO THE RIGHT OF THE FUEL LEVEL THERE ARE 2 DIALS, ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER. THE TOP ONE IS THE NUMBER OF FEET BETWEEN YOUR CURRENT DEPTH AND THE SEA BOTTOM. WHEN IT REACHES 0, YOU HAVE RUN AGROUND. DIRECTLY BENEATH THIS GAUGE IS THE WAT
ER TEMPERATURE GAUGE. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, IT'S COMPLETELY USELESS.

     TO THE RIGHT OF THESE GAUGES IS THE 'CHRISTMAS TREE'. THESE LIGHTS INDICATE THE STATUS OF ALL HULL OPENINGS. GREEN= CLOSED, RED= OPEN. ALL HULL OPENINGS CLOSE AUTOMATICALLY WHEN SUBMERGERGED.

     DIRECTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE IS THE COMPASS. UNDERNEATH THAT IS THE THROTTLE INDICATOR, AND TO THE RIGHT OF THESE IS THE CLOCK. THE SWEEP HAND INDICATES THE MINUTES, AND THE HOUR IS PRINTED AT THE BOTTOM.

     BENEATH THE CLOCK IS THE DIVE BUBBLE. THE BUBBLE IN THE BAR WILL SLIDE TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT TO INDICATE DIVING OR SURFACING, OR STAY IN THE MIDDLE TO INDICATE NO VERTICAL TRAVEL.
