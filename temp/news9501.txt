        Across the nation, the Internet is killing BBSes. In areas where
the local, community bulletin board used to flourish, only a few hardy
survivors remain, eeking out an existance among those too poor to pay
for regular access to the "Information Superhighway". (Yes, folks, I
don't like that catchphrase any more than you do).

        This picture may sound a little drastic, and in a way it is -
there are few areas where local BBSing has been totally killed.
Virtually everywhere, however, has been hit to some degree. Boston is
home to a plethora of Internet startups, all of which had made a dent in
BBS usage. Usage on my system has dropping perhaps 20% in the past year,
since the new ISPs came online, and many other small BBSes in Boston are
experiencing much greater falloff. The only way I hold on is by offering
a gigantic (3.1 gigabytes, 2.5 on Hard Disks) file area, something most
systems can't afford to do.

        In more rural areas, this hasn't had a chance to happen yet, but
it's spreading. If small, local BBSes can't manage to provide a new
attraction for the majority of users, the slide will continue as
Internet access gets easier and easier to obtain and use. Two years ago,
it was a struggle to obtain an account - now you can go to the bookstore
and buy a book with a month's free SLIP/PPP access. OS/2 Warp makes it
even easier - click a button, answer a few simple questions, and you
have the level of access that would take hours of fiddling, and a lot of
money, before. Windows '95 will also have some TCP/IP connectivity built
in (although not at the same level as OS/2 Warp - there won't be any
integrated client programs besides simple text mode FTP and Telnet, and
no default service provider). It'll all contribute. The local BBS isn't
dead, but it might be gasping for air.

        With that out of the way, Happy Holidays and welcome to the
January, 1995, edition of IceNEWS! Some more interesting stuff (as
usual, I hope) for you in this issue - information from the author on
Linker Pro, the Search for the Perfect BBS, my own trouble installing a
new SCSI hard drive, and more. I'm sticking with a smaller format again,
but I'd like comments from readers before making it permanent.

        I'd also like to extend the IceNEWS staff. First, I'm looking
for someone who'd be interested in doing a regular opinion column
similiar to my own, on subjects pertaining to the computer industry as a
whole, or to BBSing in particular. We're still looking for a new
Hardware/Operating Systems editor, as well as some freelance writers. If
you're interested, please send me an email (1@6754 IceNET, 1@9351
WWIVnet, 1@1 ExpressNET). We published a copy of the Writers Guide a few
months back, and you can also ask for a copy of it.

                              The Search

The Search for that perfect BBS began with an Commodore Color 64 BBS package.
I was thrilled with this BBS and learned how to be SysOp a good host. Still I
found myself looking to the future searching for a higher goal where I could
maximize the value of my System to it's fullest. I soon switched over to WWIV.
I am like many bulletin board users and SysOp's where I harbor the dream of
having a place in cyberspace given the opportunity to meet new people, to
bring my vision and unique skills to the online community whatever they may be.

I had to place aside any notion about running a BBS as being easy or a
part-time endeavor. I found myself up late many nights configuring software,
installing new games, fixing unexpected hardware failures or answering a
mailbox stuffed with e-mail. I became prepared to come with inexpensive yet
creativer ways to attract new users to my system with in time. I soon found the
first and most important issue that a SysOp must face is defining her or his
vision. Then to stay with it. After defining your vision and selecting the
appropriate software you find your work has just begun!

WWIV BBS is a fine and great BBS package with potential for the future with the
five key features to look for in any BBS. Advanced file management supporting
key word and description text search, multiple CD-ROM support and file area
grouping. Messaging facilities with internet support, compatibility with
offline mail readers, header search capabilities and handle alias support.
Compatibility with external programs such as doors, database's, games, the
number of online and offline utilities that will work with the software, the
types of utilities available. Multi-node capacity and multitasker support which
management facilities are provided. Real time conferencing, the ability to have
multiple conference and private user to user on line contacts. Then the last
thing to consider is the softwares performance with its architecture layout.
WWIV is the perfect BBS. Did I really think this, no so still I felt that there
must be one better.

With the above there are still many other aspects that must be planned as you
launch your BBS, example would be to marketing and advertising. Many SysOp's
like myself don't always realize that it takes a long time to build a stable
user base. I forgot to consider that I had all of the above and began my
search once more for that perfect BBS Package. I was able to locate other
packages such as Powerboard BBS, RoboBoard, Searchlight, Major, Synchronet
BBS, VBBS, WildCat, PowerBBS and many more, Here I thought I would find that
perfect BBS package! Each of these other software packages offer many of the
same features as that of WWIV. One must kept this in mind.

Now each of these BBS packages are very good and each has something to offer,
So my search began with Powerboard that is ideal for novices, that this
shareware program allows for quick installation and a fast menu developer. You
can run multiple sessions from the same computer. It supports internet with a
UUCP driver and lets you hook into standard electronic mail relays like
Fidonet, QWK mail and PCrelay/postlink with support for Rip graphics. I was not
happy with this BBS so I installed a test demo and soon a real working version
of RoboBoard which is ideal for business boards as well for the general BBSs.
Roboboards strongest feature is its graphical online interface. The software
provides WYSIWYG, and yes I know, what the heck is WYSIWYG?

Well WYSIWYG is What-you-see-is-what-you-get stands for WYSIWYG. With all of
its pretty screens I still was not happy. Major BBS became my very next BBS, I
said this one will be it, that perfect BBS package. I install a working
version of Major which I found to support RIP graphics and could support 256
simultaneous users on one single computer and did everything that WWIV did.
This is for me I said, I have that perfect BBS. No not really, I still was not
happy and my search still continued on untill Searchlight came to my
attention. Here I made that mistake of buying a version of Searchlight out of
frustration with unlimited nodes. This I know will be that BBS package I want,
that perfect System beyond a doubt. Again this was not fitting my Idea of that
perfect BBS and so it sits in its box next to my computer. While WWIV is in
command running on my Computer as it has been for the last ten years or more
and if any SysOp was to give real thought they would find WWIV is perhaps the
nearest to be perfect BBS package. I guess one might say I fell into that
thinking of having pretty screens and little frills of fancy ornaments rather
then having that perfect BBS which came to be WWIV. Yes, my search had ended
with the finding of that perfect BBS package called WWIV.

        I was asked to write an artical for IceNEWS after a popular
discution had started up on the IceNET sysops sub about network1
preprocessors. Some of the features that I planed in Linker Pro caused a
little bit of contraversy. The features include

PGP on out-going mail
Compression tests on all through packets
Vebose Hub logs on all through packets
File and linked packet checking
Local striping capability.

I guess at first people got a little scared about the stripping capability, but
after clearing up the fact that it would only work locally a lot of the fears
were dispelled. One thing that has come up recently is the ability of old
versions of Stripit being able to work as a network1 preprocessor. Now that
doesn't suprise me at all.
        People seem to think that the data format for packet scanning is
some big secret and there has to be strict control over packet scanners. I
have some information for people who think there has to be complete control.
The WWIV packet format is no great secret and it doesn't take much effort at
all to make a network1 preprocessor. The simple fact is that WWIV offers no
security in it's packet format and to be truely secure people should start
consintrating on sending stuff via direct connection. For those of you who are
curious on how easy it is here is some code to get some of you started on
your own packet scanning software.

#include "net.h"  // from WWIV source
#include <dir.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <io.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys\stat.h>
#include <dos.h>

void anal(char *fn1)
{
FILE *in;
char *pData;
unsigned short *list;
unsigned int i=0;
net_header_rec nh;

 if ((in=fopen(fn1, "rb"))==NULL) {
   printf("ERROR: Opening file\n");
   exit(1);
 }

while(fread((void*)&nh, sizeof(net_header_rec), 1, in)) {
   i++;
   printf("\015Record #%u, Type=%u/%u               ", i, nh.main_type,nh.minor
_type);

   if (nh.list_len) {
      list=(unsigned short*)malloc(nh.list_len*sizeof(int));  //allocate List
      fread((void*)list, (long)nh.list_len*sizeof(int), 1, in);
   }
   pData=(char*)malloc(nh.length);        //allocate buffer
   fread((void*)pData, nh.length, 1, in);

    // do what you need to here with the data that you have loaded

   free((void*)pData);    // get rid of memory allocated here.
   free((void*)list);
 }
 fclose(in);  // close file
}

void main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    anal(argv[1]);
}

        WWIV doesn't currently support direct connection but PGPing that Linker
will offer is one solution to the security problem. PGP capability in WWIV
packets is a whole new ball of wax, mainly because of the contriversy on
WWIVLink about PGP. Linker Pro will allow people to send email in encrypted
format AUTOMATICALY. Automatic security should be taken for granted and since we
have not method of direct mail sending (which may be the next project I
develop). Linker Pro v1.0 and Linker v3.7 will also append routing info and
to all mail sent through Linker so that all packets can be tracked. The
compression test is preformed on standard mail packets and systems may be
exempted from the compression tests. Verbose hub logs consist of loged info
on what data is being sent to system which direct connect with the system
using Linker Pro (Another hot topic I am sure).
        The main purpose of Linker Pro is to allow the average sysops control
of the data that goes through his system. The origonal Linker has gone as far
as possable and now it's about time we had a network1 preprosessor with the
flexability that WWIV sysops have been requesting for a long time.

[Editor's Note : For those who are interested, a Direct Mail program for
WWIV is under development by a third party, including Direct E-Mail and File
Transfer characteristics. When development has progressed far enough, I hope
to procure an article on the subject from the author.]

  ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


        I was an early adopter of the SCSI standard (back around 1990, before
IDE really took hold, and you could still find an MFM controller without
too much trouble). SCSI looked promising then - you could link multiple
peripherals onto one high speed board, and save yourself time, money,
and expansion slots. Configuration wasn't any more difficult than
anything else, at the time.

        Nearly five years later, SCSI (and SCSI-2) have done a pretty
good job of living up to their early promise. Over the years I've
invested quite a lot of money into SCSI peripherals, and I've been able
to keep every one of them in service, and operating quickly. IDE (and
more recently, Enhanced IDE) have taken some of the market away, but for
large capacity drives, CD-ROMs (although there are a few EIDE models
becoming available), and estoeric devices such as SyQuests, CD-Rs,
Magento-Optical, and even digital cameras, SCSI still can't be beat.

        Of course, there are a few snags. When I bought the 486 I use to
run the BBS (my main system) last year, I also bought a new VLB SCSI-2
adapter from BusLogic (by either luck or intelligence, I managed to
avoid buying the UltraStor model before that company went under). The
problem with this adapter was that it used a DB-50 SCSI-2 connector to
hook up with external devices. Finding this cable took several months
and ended up costing me over $50. Prices have since gone down, and
availability gone up.

        And this month, when I obtained a new Seagate 2gigabyte SCSI-2
Hard Disk Drive. My existing Fujitsu 540 megabyte had filled up, and I
had to resort to archiving BBS file areas on floppy disks. Since you can
only have two hard disks in a PC without going through a lot of hassle,
I wanted to get one that would take me through the rest of the
operational life of this machine.

        However, when I installed the drive, all was not immediately
perfect. There are a few steps to follow when installing a new SCSI hard
drive (the one I was installing was configured to be the second drive in
the system):

 1. Before you open anything up, figure out what the appropriate SCSI
    ID is. If it's the first Hard Disk, it has to be 0. If it's the
    second, it has to be 1. These ID's are reserved. If it's another
    type of peripheral, find an ID in the upper ranges that isn't in
    use.

 2. Look at the SCSI cable, and decide in which order you're going to
    end up linking the drives together in. SCSI device chains require a
    "Terminator" at the end of the chain (on the last device connected).
    On hard drives, this will consist of either a chip or package to
    insert or remove, or a jumper cable. Consult your drive manual. The
    terminating resistor is important, as without it the controller will
    send too much power through the chain, slowly cooking your
    electronics.

 3. Make sure that the new hard drive is set correctly. This includes
    terminators, SCSI IDs, and anything else.

        Once you've done this (read any relevant manuals), you can
actually install the drive. Make sure that the final device (and no
other devices) are terminated, and that the ID's are set. Also check
that Pin 1 on each drive is connected to the same side of the cable (you
may need to twist it). SCSI cables usually have a red stripe down one
side to show the location of Pin 1. Make absolutely sure that this is
correct on all drives and on the controller.

        In theory, now, you should be able to turn the computer on, run
FDISK, and partition drive two (if you've only got one drive, you need a
DOS install/Boot disk, or OS/2 Install disks). And in fact, it usually
works this way.

        Of course, I hadn't counted on Murphy's First Law of Computing -
nothing ever works the first time. I opened the machine back up, checked
all the connections, IDs, terminators, and cabling, and tried again.

        Murphy's Second Law of Computing bears a striking resemblance to
his first.

        When something like this happens, and you know that your setup
is correct, there are really two things you can suspect. The first is
hardware failure, and this is not unlikely - in its FedEx facilitated
rush from Arizona to Boston, the drive could concievably have broken
something. I tested this by removing the older drive from the circuit
(unhooked the cable), and setting my new drive as the final device,
terminated, with SCSI ID 0, as if it were the only drive in the system.

        I put in my DOS 6.2 Install disk, turned on the computer, and
waited. Needless to say, everything worked. The installer sat there for
a while, formatting, and then I had a one-gig partition to use (without
software/hardware tricks, DOS can only adress the first 1024 cylinders
on a Hard Drive, or one gigabyte. In this case, the first gigabyte worth).
Most SCSI cards (like mine) that are worth their salt have a DIP switch
or other configuration item that will allow them to buffer int13h, and
access larger amounts in DOS (mine will do eight gigabytes, if I flip
the switch).

        Since I knew the hard disk was functional, the problem had to be
an incompatibility between my old Fujitsu drive and the new Seagate.
Sometimes, however, all that the incompatibilty does is prevent the new
drive from being recognized unpartitioned/unformatted (and this indeed
happened - there was no sign of the Seagate drive the first time around,
from anything, including the OS/2 System Information Tool, and the boot
up diagnostics). So I reset everything the way it had been at the start,
and powered up the machine.

        Needless to say, it worked perfectly. I was then able to use the
OS/2 FDISK utility to partition it into three chunks (with a large
drive, I prefer the partitions), and format. OS/2 deals with using over
cylinder 1024 with the High Performance File System, so I installed that
and used it for the second two partitions. With the appropriate driver,
you can also use FAT.

        SCSI configuration can be an excellent challenge, but it's fair
to say that it's usually a little easier to deal with than this.

  ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


        Since our review of OS/2 Warp last issue, there have been several
enhancements made to the product. First, IBM makes new versions of the
TCP/IP related programs available free over the Internet. Since last
month, three updates have been made:

NewsReader/2 1.07 - A maintenance release with a few additional
                    configuration features and usability upgrades.

WebExplorer/2 0.95 - An upgrade of IBM's WorldWideWeb/Mosaic browser.
                     Bug fixes, multithreading support (will load up to
                     four images at a time), speed increases. Still
                     lacks support for mailto: links, but it's coming.

PPP Gamma - Update to the "Dial Other Internet Providers" application,
            now supporting the PPP protocol as well as SLIP, and
            offering several other nice features (for instance - a
            checkbox on the dialing screen that will dial "9" before the
            number - very usefull with laptops when you're plugging
            into different phone systems).

        Also, OS/2 Warp for the PowerPC entered Beta Testing on December
14, 1994, on schedule for the expected 1st half release date. The OS/2
Warp GA and LAN versions are also reported to be on schedule.

CD ROM Review  : "Hobbes OS/2 Archived" (August 1994 edition)
Publisher      : Walnut Creek CDROM
Reviewer       : Mr. Jones - Freewheelin' BBS (612) 647-5841
E-mail         : 1@6281

System Requirements:

Obviously if you intend to use the programs on the CD you need
OS/2 and a CD ROM drive.  The CD may also be used with a BBS
system running from DOS or OS/2 to make OS/2 files available to
callers.  Archives are mostly in ZIP form though some ZOO files do
appear.  Archivers are included on the CD and are automatically
invoked by the menu shell when a file is selected.

Review:

Hobbes OS/2 is THE CD for OS/2 fans.  This disc is updated
quarterly.  I owned the Feb, 94 edition before receiving the
August version for this review.  The CD is available as a
subscription with quarterly updates direct from the publisher. 
Subscribers will pay the list price, so this is not necessarilty
the most economical option, street prices run $5-7 lower.

Like any shareware CD ROM, there is always the issue of current
files.  The lag time between program updates and CD publication
can often mean a newer version of a program is released before
the CD is in your hands.  Being updated quarterly, Hobbes OS/2
does not fall victim to this nearly as often as many shareware CD
ROM disks.

The files on the CD are accessible via a menu shell executable
from either DOS or OS/2.  The CD is also BBS ready for sysops who
would like to make this selection of OS/2 programs and files
available on their BBS system.

Over 3000 OS/2 files are on the CD.  Files are broken down into
sections on two levels.  First, by the OS/2 version the program
is written for, 1.x, 2.x, 2.1 or all.  Within each of these
sections files are grouped into topics such as games, graphics
utilities, demos, programming, etc.

The shell program allows you to navigate the directories on the
CD quickly and easily, files are displayed by name and include a
one line description via this menu shell.  When the user finds a
file of interest, simply highlighting it and hitting enter will
extract the program into the directory of your choice.

The directory structure of the CD makes sense, though it is a bit
cumbersome if you need to navigate at the command line level. 
The basic directory layout is consistent from version to version,
which as a sysop who had to manually install the directories to
my BBS, made upgrading to the August release much easier.  Of
course, if you use a BBS system that has data files on the CD, or
use a CD ROM door, this is probably not an issue.

BBS ready files are included for RBBS, PCBoard, opus, Spitfire,
Wildcat and Maximus with good multi-line descriptions.  I found
very rare cases where descriptions were missing.

The most encouraging thing about the Hobbes CD is that they
actually seem to keep current versions.  Old versions of files
were removed and replaced with new versions between the Feb and
August issues.  

Some other nice aspects are included disk images for upgrading
your OS/2 installation, for example 2.10 to 2.11.  Lots of
technical help files, and lots of files direct from IBM.  This
disk also includes files for programmers including full OS/2
implementations of GCC and EMX 08h C, GNU, EMACs, Ghostscript,
and more.  A good helping of games, icons, utilities and so on
are also present in mass.

If this CD is maintained in up-to-date-fashion we can expect that
releases in the first quarter of 1995 should provide new material
for OS/2 Warp.

[Editor's Note - I had to cut this listing down to size, due to the
truly stunning amount of response William Reid got on this. I found
the cutting to be extremely painful - if yours isn't here, we may
be forced to do a second installment]

        A while back I proposed a question on WWIVnet's 
National Sysop's Discussion.  The question, was simply, "what is sitting
around your computer".  The response that I got was more than I expected.
So, I decided to create this text file of the mail I received answering
my question.

        I thought it was 'neat' to know what other sysops have lying around
thier computers.  Right now, looking around mine, there's two Labtec 
speakers, a phone, a bottle of olive oil (don't ask), a bottle of extra
strength tylenol, an ashtray, an unpaid bill, several notebooks, and three
pens.  Below are the responses I got.

which cosisted of a TV dinner, it's just the "plate" now.  On the desk over the
tower case is a ton of computer related printouts, a set of Radio Shack mini
amplified speakers, a set of Radio Shack Pro-70 headphones, my Radio Shack two
line phone, four stacks of 3.5" floppies, a disk case, the mouse, a roll of
masking tape, then on top of the desk I have built shelves, (they sit over the

post-it note type things with names and numbers, my USR Sportster quick
reference for basic troubleshooting, my Radio Shack answering machine, my far
side calendar, my desk lamp, Boston electric pencil sharpener which makes the
screen wobble when used, some floppy cables and misc. case parts, a box of
clipper staples, a box of envelopes, and most important, a playing card
thumbtacked to the front of the shelves, a Suicide King.

machines (currently in use).  A puddle of water from the washing machine
overflow, a bucket, a plastic bag, the sewer stack, a garden hose, and the
basement walkout screen door (removed a year ago to bring large items into the
basement, never reinstalled).  A bunch of tools, and an antifreeze jug with

I think you have a new idea for what to do when there is nothing to do.

On this desk there are at least 72 floppies, 3 tape boxes, I dolphin, a
champange glass with DEAD flowers from my sweetie < they were not dead when I
got it> a pencil holder ,holding a screwdriver < the pencils just lie on the
desk>, three note pads, an address book, 2 CD's tittle to the car various
instruction manuals , a few miles < marlboro miles that is> the bonus
certificate from sears, one chip puller, an easter bunny candy basket, 4
candles  < of course that lighter and cigarettes and a couple of books of
matches for back up>

AND "My Coffee Cup"

plus various other sundry things. like the emory board, a couple of packets of
sweet&low and 27 different phone numbers on little pieces of paper that I can
never call or throw away, because if they were important enough to write down
they musst be kept.

  What the BBS sits on is actually the file extention of my desk, and it sits
directly over the top of the files, so that I can't get at them...  On the file
stand (which is free standing of the actual desk, wherein resides my "play"
computer) ther is alos an amplifyer that is used for the "play" computer,
stacks of books atop that (Dictionary, the Book of Massage, MS-DOS advanced
(Yea, right) applications, various modem, and hardware configuation infolets,
a windows manual (Still shrink wrapped..) a digital clock, some blank stock
disks, Watches (By Dean R. Koontz...  great read...) The amplifyer is stitting
on an old XT case (Long since gutted, and now holds paper stock for my printer
inside the drivebays, as well as the amplifyer on top..) Next to the stand is a
box with an adaptec SCSI controller card, and my old briefcase, and an old
calandar with Patrick Nalgel prints... under is a BIG of O' parts... If I ever
need a part, I simply dig thru it, and I probably have it in there...

That about sums up the computers enviroment...

Well here's what's around me.
I have pictures that my 5 year old drew on the wall, I have my power surge
protector (the kind your monitor stands on) standing up against the wall (my
1.5 year old has turned the computer off too many times).  I have 2 phones
(voice, bbs), a really dusty lamp, scotch tape, mouse pad, spare change
everywhere, disk labels, unpaid bills, post it notes, pamphlets for my
daughters school, pens, my tower (and the printer that is on top of the tower),
the catfood/water on the shelf under the table top, and 3 REALLY CLUTTERED JUNK
DRAWERS.  Is this sufficient?  :)  In short, it's your typical desk with a
computer on a table that is about 4' long and 2' deep.

Far too much to list, actually...well, there is a half plentypak of Doublement,
numerous bits of paper with notes on them, a 1/4" nutdriver, my other glasses,
teh TV remote control, books on animals for reference in running Pet Net, my
empty coffee cup that I wish would fill itself...of course it would have to
make  the coffee first cause I'm out.

     V.  BBSLIST/CONNECT FILES AND MESSAGE ROUTING

          So how does the network software know where to send an off-system
          message, especially if the BBS has more than one connect?  FidoNet has
          its nodelists, and so does WWIVnet.  WWIVnet actually has two
          different types of node lists, as mentioned elsewhere.  We'll take
          these separately, then discuss figuring out the routing.

          A.  Old WWIVnet -- BBSLIST.NET & CONNECT.NET

               In the beginning of WWIVnet, there were only two files needed to
               keep up with the systems in the network -- BBSLIST.NET and
               CONNECT.NET.  Though this is rarely used now, there are still
               some smaller networks which use these files, so they should be
               discussed.

               BBSLIST.NET holds a listing of what systems are in the network. 
               Each system has an entry, with the systems usually grouped by
               area code.  The format for each system's line: system number
               (preceded by @), system phone number (preceded by *), max bps
               rate of the system (preceded by #), system flags if any, WWIV
               registration number or date of entry (enclosed in brackets), and
               system name (enclosed in "").  For example, the BBSLIST line for
               Amber in WWIVnet could be:
               @1     *310-798-9993  #14400 <  !$     [1]  "Amber"

               Most of the system flags after the modem speed indicate the kind
               of high-speed modem being used by the system.  Currently, these
               flags are:

               | -- Telebit-compatible (PEP) modem.
               < -- USR HST 9600+bps modem.
               > -- Hayes V-Series compatible 9600+bps modem.
               Z -- Zoom V.32terbo (19.2kpbs) modem.
               / -- CompuCom 9600+bps modem.
               ! -- CCITT V.32 (9600bps) modem.
               $ -- CCITT V.32bis (14.4kbps) modem.
               ~ -- V.FAST (28.8kbps) modem.
               ? -- Fax-capable modem (not currently used)

               Other system flags used which are not modem designators:
               + -- The system is a dedicated mail server.  That is, it is not a
                    true BBS, only handles the transfer of network mail for an
                    area or region.
               \ -- Fidonet system.  Some systems in the network have "gateways"
                    into Fidonet (or Fidonet compatible, such as GlobalNet).
               = -- PCPursuitable system.  This is actually not useful since
                    PCPursuit has gone out of business (though there are other
                    similar networks still operating).
                    [IceNEWS Editor's Note: PC Pursuit did not go out of
                     business. Sprint, the parent company, simply elected
                     not to offer the servive any longer]
               _ -- End node.  That is, a system with only one connection.

               There can also be one of three flags appearing before the phone
               number:
               ^ -- Area Code coordinator (AC).
               & -- Network Coordinator (NC).
               % -- Group Coordinator (GC)
               Note that since there can only be one Network Coordinator, the
               "&" should only appear once in the BBSLIST.NET file.  Also, the
               "%" is not likely to be seen except in the Group setup described
               below, since this setup has no Groups.

               The first line of the BBSLIST.NET must be a tilde (~) followed by
               the Unix timestamp (seconds since midnight, Jan 1, 1970)
               indicating the date and time the file was sent out by the NC or
               GC.

               CONNECT.NET lists the connection costs between systems.  The cost
               listed should be the cost per minute, though for most networks
               using this system, the rule of thumb is 0.00 for local connects,
               0.01 for long distance connects, and more for long distance
               connects that one wants to route less mail through.

               Each entry in the CONNECT.NET file specifies a one-way connection
               between two systems.  The entries in the CONNECT.NET file do NOT
               need to be in any specific order.  The format for system's
               connection entry is: the system number (preceded by "@"), first
               connection and cost (separated by "="), second connection and
               cost, and so forth.  Like BBSLIST.NET, the first line is a tilde
               (~) followed by the UNIX timestamp.

               Examples:
               1.   If there are two systems, numbered 1 and 2, and each can
                    call each other for free, the CONNECT.NET file would look
                    like:
                    @1      2=0.00
                    @2      1=0.00

                    Note that the routing analysis software should make sure
                    both ends of the connection have entries referring to each
                    other.

               2.   If there are three systems, each can call the others for
                    free, the CONNECT.NET file would look like:
                    @1      2=0.00 3=0.00
                    @2      1=0.00 3=0.00
                    @3      1=0.00 2=0.00

               3.   If system 3 called the other two for $0.10, the CONNECT.NET
                    file would look like:
                    @1      2=0.00 3=0.10
                    @2      1=0.00 3=0.10
                    @3      1=0.10 2=0.10


               In both BBSLIST.NET and CONNECT.NET file, each entry begins with
               identifying the system number (preceded with @), allowing system
               entries to take up more than one line -- in larger networks a
               CONNECT.NET entry can fill more than one line.  Everything after
               the system number identifier up to the next "@", corresponds to
               that system.  Thus, the CONNECT.NET files above could also be
               listed as:

               @1 2=0.00 3=0.10 @2 1=0.00 3=0.10 @3 1=0.10 2=0.10

               or

               @1
               2=0.00
               3=0.10
               @2
               1=0.00
               2=0.10
               @3
               1=0.10
               2=0.10

               Thus, the end-of-line indicator (EOL) should be IGNORED.

               Neither the BBSLIST.NET nor CONNECT.NET file need to be in any
               specific order.  There cannot, however, be multiple entries per
               system in either BBSLIST.NET or CONNECT.NET.

               It is possible for a system to have references in one or both of
               the .NET files, but not be reachable from any other system.  For
               example, two systems may be listed in BBSLIST.NET, and listed in
               CONNECT.NET, but each can only call the other.  No other system
               in the network can connect with them, so they don't exist,
               essentially.  Also, a system can be listed in BBSLIST.NET, but
               not have any entries in CONNECT.NET.  This usually happens for
               systems just joining the network, and those systems essentially
               don't exist either.

               It is also possible for one system to call another, but the
               second system can't call back the first.  This is unusual, but
               valid.  Also, the cost of a connection can be different in one
               direction than it is in the other.  This is also valid.

               BBSLIST.NET is received across the network as main_type 1,
               minor_type 1 (1/1).  CONNECT.NET is received as main_type 1,
               minor_type 2 (1/2).

          B.   New WWIVnet -- BBSLIST.x and CONNECT.x

               As mentioned previously, things changed in 1990.  The original
               WWIVnet network had grown so large that it was necessary to break
               the BBSLIST and CONNECT files into smaller segments, known as
               Groups.  How the Groups are determined is up to the Network
               Coordinator.  WWIVnet's Groups were formed based on the connec-
               tion topology at the time of the conversion to the Group system. 
               Many other networks use the International Time Zones to divide
               the groups.  The Groups are numbered, with the potential for up
               to 255 Groups in a network.  The BBSLIST and CONNECT files have
               the Group number ("x") as the extension.

               The BBSLIST.x file is formatted the same way as the BBSLIST.NET
               under the old WWIVnet system.  Only BBSes with the Group are in
               each Group's files.  There is an additional file, BBSLIST.0,
               which contains information for the routing analyzer.  The first
               line has the UNIX timestamp, as usual.  The second describes
               which CONNECT.x file to use.  If it is ":" alone, then CONNECT.0
               contains all the connection information for the network, so that
               is all that will be used.  If the second line is ":A", then
               CONNECT.0 and the CONNECT.x files for all Groups are used.

               There can also be partial BBSLIST updates sent out, indicating
               systems to be added, changed or removed.  The extension on these
               messages is generally Group number plus 512 (e.g., a group 1
               partial update would be BBSLIST.513).  For added or changed
               systems, the system is listed as it would appear in the BBSLIST.x
               it belongs to.  A deleted system is listed as just the system
               number with a period (.), as in "@1234 .".  These partial updates
               are incorporated into the full BBSLIST files during the routing
               analysis (see below).

               The BBSLIST.x files use the same indicators as the BBSLIST.NET
               file, with one addition:
               This should only appear once in each BBSLIST.x file, since each
               Group may only have one GC.

               CONNECT.x is not like the old CONNECT.NET.  The main difference
               is that there are no costs in the connections, only the node
               numbers each system is connected to.  So in the second example in
               the previous section, the CONNECT.x for systems 1, 2 and 3 would
               look like this:
               @1   2 3
               @2   1 3
               @3   1 2

               As noted above, the CONNECT.x files will be used as specified by
               the second line in BBSLIST.0.  When that line is ":", CONNECT.0
               will contain all the network's connections.  When it is ":A", the
               CONNECT.x files contain all the connections within each Group. 
               All connections between systems in different groups are listed in
               CONNECT.0.

               For example, say we have a network with five systems, numbered 1,
               2, 3, 4, and 5.  Systems 1 and 2 are in Group 1, and systems 3,
               4, and 5 are in Group 2.  1 and 2 connect to each other, and 2
               connects to 4.  3 and 4 connect to each other, and 5 connects to
               1.

               CONNECT.1 will contain:
               @1   2
               @2   1

               CONNECT.2 will contain:
               @3   4
               @4   3

               CONNECT.0 will contain:
               @1   5
               @2   4
               @4   2
               @5   1

               Like the old WWIVnet files, the ordering of the systems in these
               files does not matter, however a node number may appear only once
               in all of the BBSLIST.x files combined.

               The BBSLIST.x files are received across the networks as main_type
               11, with the minor_type being determined by the Group they are
               for.  CONNECT.x files are received as main_type 12, with the
               minor_type determined by the Group number.

          C.  Figuring the Routing

               There are three ways message routing could be determined:
               1.   Each time you need to route a message, find the least cost
                    or shortest path (depending on whether new or old update
                    files are being used);
               2.   Each time one of the network programs that has to route
                    messages is run, the least-cost or shortest route to each
                    system is decided; or
               3.   Each time an update to the .NET files is received, the least
                    cost route is decided to each system. 

               Options 1 and 2 are simply not practical.  Depending on network
               size and system speed, it can take a minute or more to analyze
               the network data files and determine the optimal route.  Finding
               the best route to a specific system requires the same operation
               as finding the best route to all systems, so option #1 is a waste
               of time (besides possibly requiring the BBS to have the path-
               finding code in it).  Option #2 holds no advantages over option
               #3 because it will tie up the BBS unnecessarily.

               Therefore, the optimal routes to all the systems in the network
               should be analyzed only when a network update is received.  
               This routing analysis can be done any way, as long as it
               determines the best route.  The best way, however, could follow
               these steps:
               1.   System records are read into an array from BBSLIST.NET (for
                    the old WWIVnet setup) or the BBSLIST.x files (for the Group
                    setup).  The array is of struct net_system_list_rec (see
                    below).  All fields are filled from the BBSLIST.x except
                    numhops and forsys, which are set to 65535 and 0, respec-
                    tively.  For the Group setup, the BBSLIST.xxx partial
                    updates (.513-.768) are read in next, and the indicated
                    changes (existing systems replaced, new systems added,
                    systems indicated with "." deleted) are made in the array
                    and in the BBSLIST files themselves.  After processing, the
                    partial updates are deleted.

               2.   Next, the CONNECT files are read into another array.  Since
                    system records may be repeated in the CONNECT files, make
                    sure, when each system record is read in, a check is made in
                    the array to see if there is already an entry for it.  If
                    there is, add the connections in the new record to the
                    existing record.

               3.   Then, the analysis starts.  The analyzer uses the system's
                    callout list (CALLOUT.NET for NETxx) as a base, starting
                    with the first entry and checking each of its connnects,
                    spreading out from there to THEIR connects.  This is done
                    for each system in the callout list.

                    For each destination system checked, the number of hops
                    found is compared to that entered in the network data array
                    (numhops) and changed if it is less.  The forsys is also
                    changed, if that is different.  This is for the Group setup.

                    If the network is using the old WWIVnet setup, cost, rather
                    than number of hops, is considered.  In this case, when
                    figuring cost, the speed of a connection (highest speed two
                    connecting systems will support) needs to be considered. 
                    For instance, two systems connecting at 14400bps at a cost
                    of 0.10 would take precedence over two systems connectiung
                    at 2400bps at a cost of 0.10 (assuming that they are on the
                    path to the same destination system, and all other scosts
                    are equal).

               4.   When all systems in the callout list are processed, analysis
                    is complete and the network data array is written to disk. 
                    If specified, a piece of mail is then sent to the sysop
                    giving the results of the analysis (for instance, how many
                    valid systems are in the network, how many systems route
                    through each of this system's connections, who the NC and GC
                    and AC are, and so forth).

               The data structure NETxx's NETWORK3.EXE uses for the network data
               file is: 

               typedef struct {
                    unsigned short sysnum;        /* system number */
                    char           phone[13],     /* phone number of system */
                                   name[40];      /* name of system */
                    unsigned char  group;         /* group system is in */
                    unsigned short speed,         /* max bps rate of system */
                                   other,         /* other info (bit mapped) */
                                   forsys;        /* next hop from here */
                    short          numhops;       /* how far to get there */
                    union {
                         unsigned short rout_fact; /* routing factor */
                         float          cost;     /* cost factor */
                         long           temp;     /* temporary variable */
                    } xx;
               } net_system_list_rec;

               It is encouraged that this structure be used by any WWIVnet
               compatible analyzer.  Not only is this used by the WWIV BBS
               software, but some WWIVnet add-ons also use this file, so
               supporting this structure will enhance compatibility with
               WWIVnet.

               The fields:
               sysnum, phone, name, group, and speed should be self-explanatory.

               other --  This is bitmapped, and contains the modem and other
                         information shown in BBSLIST.  The bitmap values are
                         (with corresponding BBSLIST flag):
                         \    other_fido          0x0001
                         |    other_Telebit_19200 0x0002
                         <    other_USR_9600      0x0004
                         >    other_Hayes_9600    0x0008
                         ^    other_coordinator   0x0010 (area coordinator)
                         !    other_V32           0x0020
                         $    other_V32bis        0x0040
                         =    other_PCP           0x0080
                         %    other_group_coord   0x0100
                         &    other_net_coord     0x0200
                         /    other_compucom      0x0400
                         +    other_net_server    0x0800
                         ?    other_FAX           0x1000
                         _    other_end_system    0x2000
                         ~    other_VFAST         0x4000

               forsys -- Where to forward messages destined for this system,
                         also known as "next hop".  For example, if a message
                         going from system 1 to system 5 passes through systems
                         2 and 4, then forsys==2.  When it is determined that
                         the system is unreachable (listed in BBSLIST but no
                         connections listed), forsys==65535.

               rout_fact -- This is the routing factor, but is currently not
                         used by the NETxx software.

               cost --   When using an old-style WWIV network setup, this holds
                         the cost of the call, calculated as the sum of costs
                         for each hop to the destination.

               When all systems have been processed, you should have a database
               containing all systems in the network and how they may be
               reached.  Whenever a packet that is not destined for the local
               system is processed, the data file is searched to find the system
               entry for the destination system.  If it is not found, then the
               system is unknown.  If the system is identified as unreachable
               (forsys==65535), the system is also considered unknown.

     VI.  TIPS FOR WRITING WWIVNET SOFTWARE

          That about covers all the technical details for designing software
          compatible with WWIV networks.  Now for some things to consider for
          those wishing to design a WWIVnet interface for a non-WWIV BBS, or
          add-ons to existing WWIVnet software.

          A.   WWIVnet Interface Software

               The information provided in this document is enough for anyone
               wishing to write WWIVnet interface software from scratch.  Unless
               you are writing for a BBS on a non-PC platform (such as Hermes
               for Macintosh), there is no need to rewrite all of the software
               to interface a PC-based BBS to a WWIV network.  Since the local
               mail processor (NETWORK2.EXE) is the only program that writes to
               BBS message bases, that is really the only one needing replace-
               ment.  If any of the NETxx programs are used, it is essential
               that all of the supporting data files used by that software be
               present.  For details on those files, see the WWIVnet software
               documentation.

               Some additional programming may be necessary, though.  For one, a
               shell would be useful for executing the various network programs,
               unless the BBS can be modified to make the calls itself.  A batch
               file could do it, but a program such as Jim Wire's CLOUT makes it
               much easier.  Any shell or BBS modification should follow these
               steps (filenames in parentheses are programs from NET34 or files
               created/used by them):
               1.   Choose a system to call (or have one specified), then
                    execute the network callout program (NETWORK.EXE).  If
                    successful, proceed to step 2.  If not, either try again or
                    end processing.
               2.   Check for the incoming netmail file (P*.NET).  If there
                    isn't one, end processing.  If there is one, run the netmail
                    packet analyzer (NETWORK1.EXE).
               3.   Check for the local mail file packet (LOCAL.NET).  If there
                    is none, end processing.  If there is one, run the local
                    mail packet analyzer (NETWORK2.EXE).
               4.   Check again for a netmail packet (outgoing messages result-
                    ing from local mail processing).  If there is one run the
                    netmail analyzer, otherwise proceed to the next step.
               5.   Check for a BBSLIST or CONNECT update.  The most reliable
                    way to do this is to compare the filedates of the CONNECT
                    and BBSLIST files against the filedate of the database file
                    created last time the routing analyzer ran.  If one or more
                    of the files is new (or there is a partial BBSLIST update),
                    run the routing analyzer (NETWORK3.EXE).

               If the software cannot be modified to handle these steps, it is
               probably best to use a front-end such as Front Door or
               Binkleyterm, then set up events that would run the shell for
               making the network calls and processing.

               The trickiest part is exporting messages from the BBS to a WWIV
               network file.  Possibly the easiest way to pack new messages is
               to have the BBS write them out to Fido packets (if the BBS is
               Fido-compatible), then when control returns to the front end, run
               an event that converts the Fido packet to a WWIV mail file.  When
               doing this, keep in mind that WWIV networks do not have all of
               the fields a WWIV packet does, most notably the "To:" field.

               Another method could be a program that, after the BBS returns
               control to the front end, scans the BBS's message bases for new
               messages on the WWIVnet subboards.  This would work best for BBS
               programs that cannot export Fido messages.  In either case, it is
               important that the netmail file processor analyze the outgoing
               message file (P*.NET) for tossing into the various connection
               files (S*.NET and Z*.NET).

               Of course, the optimal solution, if possible, would be to modify
               the BBS software to export the messages directly into a WWIVnet
               compatible mail file, and run the other network programs as
               needed without the shell.

               This is probably be a good time to discuss the naming of the
               incoming and pending netmail files, mentioned in step 2 above. 
               The actual name of the P*.NET can vary, depending on NETxx
               version and what program generates it.  NETWORK.EXE in older
               NETxx versions (NET33 and below) receive the netmail file as
               P1.NET, while the one in NET34 receives the file as P1-0-1.NET. 
               The "-0" in the middle indicates that NETWORK.EXE created the
               file (think of it as NETWORK0).  When other NET34 programs
               generate pending netmail files, the middle number indicates which
               program created it (NETWORK2.EXE, the local mail processor, would
               create a pending netmail file named P1-2-1.NET).  The main reason
               for this new naming system is so that we can tell the source of a
               P*.NET file being processed by the netmail analyzer.

               The WWIV BBS just creates P0.NET (network email, generally) and
               P1.NET (outggoing sub posts, generally).  WWIV 4.23 also creates
               a PGATE.NET file, which contains posts for "gated" subs (that is,
               subs which are carried on more than one network).  WWIV 4.24 does
               not use PGATE.NET for gated messages.  Multi-instance WWIV 4.23
               and above setups create P*.nnn (where 'nnn' is the instance
               number, such as P*.001 for instance 1) while a user is online,
               but they are renamed to P*.NET after the user logs off.

               The NETWORK1.EXE processes all of the P*.NET files, until none
               are left, before converting any indicated S<sysnum>.NET files
               into compressed Z<sysnuum>.NET files (see Appendix A).  It is
               important that an alternate netmail file analyzer be able to
               recognize and handle any P*.NET file, not just Pn.NET.


          B.   WWIVnet Software Add-ons

               There are two possible types of add-ons supported by the WWIVnet
               software, both working with the local mail processor.

               The external message processors (or "post-processors") are
               described above in the main_type descriptions.  As noted above,
               it is recommended that any post-processor be written to be
               compatible with main_type 27, because it provides an easier
               interface for external messages.  Again, a full description of
               how to use the external message feature is provided in the
               WWIVnet Software Documentation written by Filo.

               A common use for external messages is what is known as a "ping,"
               used by the authors of some WWIV network utilities who wish to
               gain some information about the use of their software.  The
               author sends out a main_type 27 message with the minor_type they
               are using.  If a receiving system is using the software and it is
               installed properly, it will execute after local mail processing,
               and process the request in the external message.

               The local mail processor also supports use of "pre-processors,"
               generally used to scan the local mail file for certain types of
               messages before the local mail processor gets to it.  One example
               is JAFO's AUTOSEND, which looks for sub requests and sends out
               messages from the system's subs to new subscribers.  These, also,
               are described in the WWIVnet Software Documentation.

               Naturally, any external message processor or preprocessor that
               generates new outgoing network messages must put them into a
               P*.NET file so that NETWORK1.EXE can find it and process it.


                                      APPENDIX A

     MAIL PACKET COMPRESSION

          In order to write WWIVnet software that can deal with compressed mail
          packets, you must have the PKWare Compression Libraries, available
          from PKWare, Inc. for $300.00.  This Appendix covers the necessary
          details for handling compressed mail packets.  To make the explanation
          easier, how NETWORK1 from NET34 handles compressed files will be
          explained.

          When NETWORK1 analyzes the file of messages to go out on the network
          (P*.NET), they are placed in Sxxxx.NET files (where xxxx corresponds
          to the numbers of systems in the CALLOUT.NET).  After processing of
          all P*.NET files, NETWORK1 checks to see which connections accept
          compressed files.  For each that does, its Sxxxx.NET is compressed
          with the implode() function from the PKWare libraries.  The compressed
          data is appended to the corresponding Zxxxx.NET file (which is created
          if it does not exist).  The size of the compressed segment in
          Zxxxx.NET is then checked against the size of the Sxxxx file.  If the
          compressed segment is smaller than the original file, the file header
          and segment header (see below) are updated and Zxxxx.NET is closed. If
          the compressed file is the same size or larger than the uncompressed
          file, the uncompressed version is appended to the Zxxxx.NET (overwrit-
          ing the compressed version), then the headers are updated and the file
          closed.  Whether the original Sxxxx.NET was compressed or not, it is
          deleted after it is transferred to the Zxxxx.NET.

          Thus, while an uncompressed netmail file is simply a collection of
          message packets with their headers, the compressed netmail file is a
          collection of segments which contain one or more messages, either
          compressed or not.  The file has a ten byte header, and each segment
          within the file has a five byte header.

          The netmail file header has three elements:
          compression identifier -- long int (4 bytes)
               Always set to 0xfffefffe.
          extra bytes -- unsigned short int (2 bytes)
               Number of additional bytes in the header record, being the sum of
               the bytes in all fields following .  This is to allow for future
               expansion of the header while maintaining compatibility with
               older versions of the NETxx software.  Currently, this should
               have the value of 4.
          uncompressed bytes -- long int (4 bytes)
               Length of the file when it is uncompressed.  This gets updated
               each time a new segment is added to the compressed file.

          The header on each segment of the compressed file has two elements:
          compression flag -- char (1 byte)
               Set to 0 if segment is NOT compressed, 1 if it is.
          segment length -- long int (4 bytes)
               Set to the actual length of the segment, in bytes.

          When a netmail file is received, NETWORK1 reads the first four bytes. 
          If they are 0xfffefffe, it knows the file is compressed, so it
          decompresses it before processing the messages.  The first ten bytes
          are read in order to get the uncompressed length of the file.  Then
          for each segment, these steps are followed:
          1.   The segment header is read in, to see if the segment is com-
               pressed and how long the segment is.
          2.   If the segment is compressed, it is decompressed into a temporary
               netmail file (which is created for the first segment, and
               appended for each additional segment) using PKWare's 'explode()'
               function.  If it is NOT compressed, it is written directly to the
               temporary netmail file.

          Once all segments have been decompressed or written to the temporary
          netmail file, the original netmail file is deleted and the temporary
          netmail file is renamed to the original's name.  NETWORK1 then
          processes message packets the new uncompressed netmail file.
