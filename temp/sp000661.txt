STATEMENT FROM OMORI DEFENSE GROUP
 
Since his arrest of 10th August,1976, innocent Katsuhisa Omori is 
fabricated as a criminal of the bombing case of Hokkaido Pref 
office building, sentenced to death twice and still in jail for 
18 years. But now the truth is clear for all, that this judgement 
was filled with mistakes. We demand the Supreme Court which is
regarded as the center of the juridical administration, will end
this situation of unjust through passing the judgement in front of
the firm truth that Omori is innocent.
 
Police and prosecutor authorities have arrested Omori without any 
certain evidence, enforced to confess and finally fabricated  
tremendous number of "evidence" when they noticed that they could 
not get any deposition. 
Even after the trial has started, prosecutor disturbed our
defense acts of rebuttal evidence. The court of justice should  
have dismiss the prosecution in the name of an idea of justice
and fairness. 
 
Unfortunately, the court of justice has made same mistakes twice. 
The court has distorted the "evidence" which even prosecutors 
admits themselves that might have been unadopted. 
Irrational presumptions followed ignoring the principles of the 
justice. As a result, Omori was convicted.
Also mass-media is responsible for this process of using police 
and prosecutors' one-sided announcement filled with prediction and
prejudice.
This case is the unparalleld false charge in the history of laws. 
The Supreme Court which is responsible as the establishments
of human rights, should recorrect the misjudgement passed at
the lower court.
 
We firmly demand that the Supreme Court will repeal and reverse 
the judgement of "death penalty" and pass Omori a judgement of  
innocence under the true justice.
