This patch came on my hard drive: (yes, my OLD one- OverDrive 40)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
     This is the info you need to copy Alien Mind for the
Apple IIgs. It has taken me since August to work this one
out as the game uses its own operating system. In order to
use this you MUST have Copy II Plus version 8.x or later. I
have played the gameon disk 1 with the copy but have not
yet tried past level 3 (althogh I've gone past that level on
the original). All that they did were change the address
marks from D5 AA 96 to D5 AA AA. Simple huh? So to make the
copy boot up Copy II plus and go to the Sector Editorand
change the following paramaters:
 
Paramater         New Value          Result
------------------------------------------------------------
   10                 AA             New Address Mark
   12                 00             Clear old one?
   55                 03             Do Header Check
   02                 40             Helps with track length
 
     Now do a complete copy (tracks 0 - 4F). Keep track of
all reads that don't have D5 AA AA (write them down). Re-try
all the tracks that didn't have the address marks correct. I
only got 5 but it varried from track to track each time I
copied it. This is a pain but if you don't want the
originals hurt then it's worth it.
 
If you use this patch and it works for you (i.e. they didn't
change the protection scheme) I would appreciate $2.00 for
my eforts - this was the most difficult and tedious patch I
have ever done due to the fact that it uses a different
operating system. Thank You for your support and enjoy.
