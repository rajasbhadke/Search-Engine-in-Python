	THE 4 HOUR DAY

        Hello fellow worker,

        Ok, here's how you might get a 4 hour work day--if you organize.
        The figures below have been gleaned from the "Survey of Current
        Business" and publications of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
        As is shown, output per worker has been growing in real terms
        since 1950.  Yet, it seems that the general standard of living
        for people who are employed (as opposed to people who are employers)
        has gone down.  Look around you.  See what's happening and then,
        if you can bear the freedom, organize.  The Industrial Workers of
        the World, IWW or Wobblies as they have been known over the years,
        offer you the opportunity to do something about crawling out of
        this abysmal situation.  But you have to take responsibility for
        your actions or non actions.  Why not make a New Years Resolution
        to get wise and organize?  You can do it.  Remember what John
        Lennon sang, "A working class hero is something to be."  Anybody
        who is an employee should take this advice to heart and begin
        by calling (415) 863-9627.  That's right 863-WOBS.

        Averaged over the same time span in constant 1982 $, wages were
        running between $7,000 and $10,000.  Remember that's an average,
        nationwide and in 1982 dollars.  Is it any wonder that the top
        1% of the households in this nation control more wealth than
        the bottom 90%?
        "The wealth of a household, or net worth, is what it owns (including
        stocks and bonds, housing and other real estate, checking and
        savings accounts, and so forth) minus what it owes in debt
        (including mortgage loans, credit card balances and business
        loans.)
        "By 1989, the top 1 percent (834,000 households with about $5.7
        trillion of net worth) was worth more than the bottom 90 percent of
        Americans (84 million households, with about $4.8 trillion in net
        worth)."
        "New York Times" page 1, April 21, 1992 issue.  Information based
        on the "Federal Reserve's triennial Survey of Consumer Finances".
        The top 1% are not the wage slaves producing the wealth.  They
        are the owners of the stock, bonds, real estate, .....
        the owners of the wealth and the means of producing the wealth.
        They employ the rest of us to produce the commodities which
        are measured by dollars and called the GNP.
        BTW, I realize the new measurement is of the GDP.  Latest
        figures are usually found mid-month in the "Wall Street Journal".
        It stands to reason that if we can produce this much wealth
        now, most of it not even coming back to us because of the
        robbery inherit in the wage system, we could produce the
        same amount, for ourselves, in half the time.  Onward
        to the four hour day, probably even less.
