SALSA BUBBA

5 lbs. tomatoes (fresh or canned)
2 lbs. onions
10 fresh jalapenos
(optional) 1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons oregano
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon salt
(optional) 1/2 cup finely grated carrots (to sweeten salsa)

Coarsely dice tomatoes and onions; finely dice jalapenos and cilantro;
(optional) finely grate carrots. Place in large steel, cast iron, or pyrex
pot. Add vinegar (if used) and spices. Stir thoroughly. Can be bottled as
is, or can be cooked if sweeter flavor is desired. (The cooked onions will
sweeten it.) If bottled cold, a bowl can, of course, be used for stirring
rather than a pot. Yields approximately 3 quarts of salsa. This is a pretty
hot recipe. If you want something milder, user fewer jalapenos. Also, if
fresh jalapenos are unavailable, you can substitute ground chiles (don't
use cayenne) at a ratio of about 1/2 teaspoon per  jalapeno.
