The Wizardry Scenario Editor is a Pascal Program which allows you to create
new scenarios for the famous WIZARDRY game written by Sir Tech. It does
have limitations . It cannot program some special effects without having to
modify the source code. However with the Scenario Editor you may, alter
monster appearances and monster abilities. Change items into super weapons
or items that turn on the bearer. And you may completely alter the topology
of any level or all levels in the maze!
 
To run the Wizardry editor you need a two drive 64K system. Make sure you
have an expendable copy of the Wizardry Scenario in drive two.
 
To make matters easier for you, you should have Apple Pascal disks #0,#1
and #3. Plus 3 blank diskettes.
 
If you want to use either the knight of diamonds or the legacy of llylgyman
scenarios you're going to have to do a little extra digging to find out how
to create some of the extra special effects. Also remember that either of
these scenarios will yield only 6 level mazes, so any references to levels
Deeper than six will result in the destruction of your created scenario.
 
Initializing a Scenario Disk:
-----------------------------
 
Before you can create a completely blank maze you require the following
items. APPLE PASCAL DISKS 0,1 and 3. A good COPYA program like DISK MUNCHER
1.0 and a COPYABLE SCENARIO side of Sir Tech's Proving Grounds of the Mad
Over Lord. As well as 2 blank diskettes.
 
Initializing a scenario disk is a complicated process. First Boot Apple
Pascal. Remove APPLE0: from drive 2 and insert APPLE3:. From the main
command prompt type X for execute.
 
Apple Pascal will ask
 
Execute what file?
 
You type APPLE3:FORMATTER.CODE
 
Once the formatter program is running remove APPLE3: and insert a blank
disk. At the drive prompt enter the number 5 if your blank is in drive 2 or
enter a 4 if your blank is in drive 1.
 
When the program is done just press return. Choose option F from the main
command prompt (F=FILER).
Now C)hange BLANK: to WIZT0:
 
Boot the Wizardry Scenario Editor and choose option 1. Place the Pascal
formatted blank in drive 2 and Format the disk.
Label your newly formatted disk SCENARIO DESTROYER and place it to the
side.
 
When the Format is completed boot one of your COPYA programs like DISK
MUNCHER or PENULTI-COPY and make a copy of the Scenario disk from the
Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord.
 
Now Boot the Scenario Editor again ( This is the last step!). Choose option
number 2. Place the COPYA scenario in drive 2 and SCENARIO DESTROYER in
drive 1 and hit return.
Find the Maze Data file in the list presented and note the Block size.
Choose the Maze Data file for transfer to your COPYA SCENARIO.
The program will say something like this
 
Source Data:20
  Dest Data:20
 
It will then ask for you to enter the starting block for both the source
and Destination files. Enter a 0 in both places. It will then ask how many
blocks to transfer, to which you type 20. When the transfer is complete you
will have on you COPYA SCENARIO a working wizardry without any maze! The
monsters/items/characters/images will all be the same, only the maze will
be completely erased. Keep SCENARIO DESTROYER on the side as a disk to wipe
out the maze.
You now have a SCENARIO which will be completely blank until you start to
change it. NOTE A COMPLETELY BLANK SCENARIO CANNOT BE USED UNTIL YOU HAVE
ENTERED AT LEAST THE STAIRWAY GOING UP/DOWN ON THE FIRST LEVEL.
 
Creating new Mazes:
-------------------
 
From the main menu choose option "F" , if you're using the Proving Grounds
as your scenario then you'll see space reserved for 10 levels. KOD and LOL
wwll have space for 6 levels.
 
Choose the desired level # to edit or enter -1 to exit.
 
EDITING THE MAZE
----------------
 
The cursor may be moved according to the following chart.
 
  Q W E
  A S D
  Z X C
 
Other important cursor action keys are I,J,K,M
 
The maze is constructed using a series of key combinations. For example: to
erase a wall on your immediate left simply type JJ. To erase any other wall
or door position the cursor and type one of the IJKM keys twice.
 
To create a section of maze is a little more difficult to do. Position the
cursor near a blank section one of the IJKM keys. The cursor will
disappear. Next type W for a wall,D for a door and S for a secret Door.
 
You also have the option of creating one way doors and disapearing
doors/panels.
 
To create a disappearing door type "/" then either IJKM and S or D.
 
To create a one-way door simply create a solid wall then type "/" and IJKM
followed by S or D.
 
You may also create a wall which is invisible on one side,but rock solid on
the other. To do this simply place the cursor on the side which you want to
be invisible and type "/" followed by pressing one of the IJKM keys twice.
 
Actually Making a Maze.
-----------------------
 
To actually create a maze,first make a hard copy on a piece of graph paper.
Carefully map your levels and indicate where you want to place stairs and
other special items.
 
You have the ability to create special effects such as:
1) NONE
2) STAIRS
3) PITS
4) DARKNESS
5) TURN RANDOM
6) NO MAGIC
7) TELEPORT
8) CHUTE
9) SPECIAL
10) SPENCOUNTER -- SPECIAL ENCOUNTERS
11) DAMAGE
 
In a completely blank maze every square is set to special #0 which is none.
I recommend that you leave this Special set to NONE. This way you have a
way of erasing the maze specials if you need to. To create some specials
you must first define the special by choosing option #2.( Edit Specials )
For example lets set special #1 to a stairway leading down to level 2 .
 
The computer will display something like this.
  EDIT SPECIALS. CURSOR AT: 3 X  5 Y
 
#      SPECIAL      PTR1   PTR2   PTR3
----------------------------------------
#0     NONE           0      0      0
#1     STAIRS        10      5      2
 
The values of the Pointers (PTRs) are really simple. PTR1 is the X location
of the stairway location on level 2 .PTR2 is the Y location of the stairway
on level 2 and PTR3 is the level the stairs go to.
 
So if we wanted a stairway on level 2 going to level 3 at X=10, Y=5 then
then our pointers would look like this:
PTR1= 10   PTR2= 5   PTR3= 3
Like wise our stairs from level 3 would be PTR1 = 10   PTR2 = 5   PTR3 = 2
 
Next Week we shall continue our series with and indepth examination of the
Specials and how to create them.
