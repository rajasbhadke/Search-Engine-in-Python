 Hello all, well I'm back after about 5-6 months of no-one hearing from me...

 I bought a Amiga, and am thinking about a GS, so well that's all
unimportant...


 My question, does anyone have a solve for Dreamzone???

 I just got it on the Amiga (yea yea i know it's like 1-1/2 years old on the
apple, but hey it was an apple ware, not an amiga)

 Later,
        Brian Fist

/s
