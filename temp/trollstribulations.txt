       INTRODUCTION:

                Ancient treasures are hidden inside the caverns! The trolls
                have set out on an expedition through the dark dungeons, 
                perilous peaks, and rising waters to retrieve the valued 
                relics. But watch out! These treacherous mazes are 
                inhabited by troll-crunching cretins, hungry buzzards, 
                ghastly skulls and sinister spiders, all intent on keeping 
                the treasures within the walls of their wicked world.
      

        OBJECTIVE:
        
                Your job is to lead the trolls through the many underground 
                mazes and recover the treasures that have been hidden there
                for centuries. Your success will depend on your skill in
                combatting the cretins and the wisdom with which you choose
                your path. You start the game with six trolls, but be careful;
                there are skulls and spiders lurking behind the cavern walls. 
                They could end your expedition at any time.


        CONTROL OF MOVEMENTS:

                Fire button: Activates each troll when it first enters the
                             maze. Once in action, pressing the fire button
                             lets you jump in the direction you are facing.
                Joystick:    Pull towards you (south) to fire. (Also to reload
                             bullets.) Push forward (north) to jump straight up.
                             Right and left movement lets you move in either 
                             direction.


        FUNCTIONS:

                Ctrl R   ...   Restarts the game.
                Ctrl S   ...   Turns sound on or off.
                Esc      ...   Pause.


        PLAYING THE GAME:

                You will begin the game with six trolls. The number of trolls
                remaining is indicated by the troll heads located in the top 
                left hand corner of the screen, just below the score.

                     In many (but not all) mazes, the first task you must
                accomplish is to shoot down eight cretins. The number remaining
                is displayed at the top center portion of your screen. After
                a cretin is shot, it will turn into an egg. You must then run
                and knock the egg off the plank and into the water before it
                can rehatch. Each troll is equipped with a gun and eight
                bullets. If you use up all eight bullets before destroying
                eight cretins, you must return to the plank with the moving
                vertical black lines in the center of the screen. Pull the 
                joystick down and your gun will be reloaded. After eight
                cretins have been destroyed, you can pass through the doors
                that lead to the maze with the hidden treasures.
                      
                    As you encounter more difficult mazes, the cretins will 
                be accompanied by low-flying buzzards and bouncing skulls.
                These hazardous obstacles cannot be shot; you must jump over
                them by facing the enemy and pressing the fire button.

                      Once inside the treasure maze, you will occasionally
                have your way obstructed by a blue door. These doors can be
                opened with the keys that are hidden in the maze along with
                the treasures. The Master door located at the end of each 
                maze does not require a key for passage.

                      There are trampolines located throughout the mazes. 
                Use the trampolines to increase your troll's jump and reach
                high ledges of the mazes.

                      Each time a troll dies, the next troll starts the
                expedition from the beginning of the maze in process. You will
                lose a troll each time you run into a cretin, get smashed by
                a bouncing skull, sit on a poisonous spider, get snatched up
                by a hungry buzzard, or fall into the water.

                      When all six trolls have lost their lives, the game is
                over. Press the fire button to return to beginning screen
                and play again.


        SCORING:

                      Points can be collected many ways while traveling
                through the mazes. Destroying cretins, recovering hidden
                treasure, and opening doors and maser doors will all 
                increase your score.

                      Once a cretin has been shot, you must run and knock
                the egg into the water. If the egg remains on the plank,
                within seconds the egg will hatch and you will not receive
                any points. The points awarded for destroying cretins 
                depends on which plank you are shooting from. The bottom
                plank is worth 100 points per cretin and points double
                each time the troll climbs up to the next plank.

                      Red cretins are worth 900 points and do not have to
                be knocked into the water.
        
                      The treasures that you will search for increase in value
                as you travel deeper into the maze. However, if a troll dies
                during the excursion and is replaced by a new troll, the 
                points awarded for recovered treasures start over at 100
                points and continue to increase until a new maze is entered.

                      Each time you open a blue door, you will receive 100
                points. (Remember that you must pick up the key before going
                through the door.) There are also points scored for reaching
                the master doors located at the end of each maze. Points are
                awarded at random for finishing the maze, ranging from 100 to
                900.

                      If you received over 10,000 points, the High Score!
                screen will appear after the game is over. Use the joystick
                to change the letters and press the fire button when the
                correct letter appears. (Due to memory constraints, this 
                high score is not written to disk.) Then press the fire 
                button to begin again.


        SPECIAL NOTE:

                As you get better and reach the more advanced levels,
                you'll get into mazes in which keys or prizes appear to
                be impossible to attain without sacrificing a troll. This
                is never the case; all treasures and keys can be collected 
                with very careful manipulation of your troll. 
                HINT: Watch the self-running demo for one such 
                maneuver on the trampoline!
