SAUDI ARABIAN BBS's

The following message was put on our board, The N.G.P.K. Shareware Board
(513-563-NGPK), by one of our members. We checked out the first two boards and
uploaded a couple of files and they seem perfectly normal.  They are
USRobotics 9600 HST, and I would recommend that you only call them with an HST
or MNP error correction because of the large amount of line noise. (We only
got 300 CPS with Z-modem and a 14,400 HST)  The other numbers were posted on
the board we called.

The Abqaiq BBS, 011 966 3 5723884
The Jebel Rebel BBS, 011 966 3 8726400
   They are in English and welcome callers from the US. They are supportive
of the US troops over there.  Here's the toll: 1 AM to 7 AM local time, the
rate is $1.92 for the first minute and 69 cents for each additional.  7
AM to 5 PM, the rate goes to $3.19 for the first minute and $1.15 for each
additional.  The 2nd least expensive time to call is between 5 PM and 1 AM,
when the rate is $2.39 for the first minute and 86 cents for each additional.
For more information on international boards, one source is Download
America BBS (203-676-1708). There's an international messaging area too,
where you can correspond with callers fromm Australia to Europe to the
Middle East to South America to Japan.
   I hope you find this useful and if you decide to try one I'd be
interested on how you did.
