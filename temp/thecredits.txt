		  -=/[ MindVox - System Design / Credits ]/=-

  The MindVox project has been made possible by a wide confluence  of  talents
  all  focused  on  the single goal of creating one of the most unique and in-
  teresting nexus points within Cyberspace.

  The continual evolution of the environment made possible by MindVox  is  the
  foremost  goal  of  the  Phantom  Access  Group,  and all design work, past,
  present and future, is geared towards the realization of this objective.

  The software that makes all of this possible  is  in  a  constant  state  of
  change  as  enhancements are made and problems eradicated.  If there is any-
  thing you would like to see that does not exist at present, or you find  any
  feature  confusing  or  difficult to use, then please let us know so that we
  can continue to make improvements.

  More than anything MindVox is an ongoing  experiment  in  human  potentials,
  that strives to push the limits of online possibility and  remain a force on
  the cutting edge of innovation in the electronic  universe that is beginning
  to awaken and expand as a new level of reality unfolds...
  
  ...it is also  really neato, and 9  out of 10 people  agree that  it's a lot
  better than watching TV.  Although it has not yet replaced sex, we feel safe
  in our assertion  that MindVox is NEWER, FLASHIER  and MORE SATISFYING  than
  Gummy Bears, and longer lasting than most hair styling products.

  Thomas E. Dell .......................................... [dell@phantom.com]

  Designed and coded  the  central  framework  that  MindVox  is  based  upon.
  Amongst his various endeavors Tom  sells an exceptional  series of BBS pack-
  ages that work with various flavors of MSDOS and Unix.  Tom can be contacted
  at  either  one  of  the following electronic addresses, or the P.O. Box for
  Darkside, his organization.

  Bruce Fancher .......................................... [bruce@phantom.com]

  Coordinated the VOICES software development effort and prevented things from
  stalling out or reaching dead ends, allowing MindVox to go live pretty close
  to the original  schedule.  Bruce  designed and  implemented MindVox's  User
  Interface  as  well  as most  of the  modifications  and  extensions to  the
  original communications  software.  In addition, he has redesigned and coded
  the internal framework of the VOICES  software to operate on a client-server
  paradigm.  Currently Bruce is head of the software development team.
  

  Scott Yelich ........................................... [scott@phantom.com]

  Scott is head of security at Phantom Access  Technologies,  and  responsible
  for  overall  network  administration  for  the mindvox and phantom domains.
  Although the ebb and flow of the perpetual SunOS security melodrama accounts
  for  a  substantial  portion  of his attention span; Scott also works on the
  design and implementation of X-based, network access tools along  the  lines
  of Mosaic, WWW and OmniWeb.


  James Waldrop .......................................... [sulam@phantom.com]

  James is the chief designer and head  of  organization  for  the  CyberWorld
  II/Sprawl  project at MindVox.  He is one of the world's foremost experts at
  MUD design and has been an instrumental factor in the development and evolu-
  tion  of  the  LP  MUD code.  As one of the original founders of TMI, he has
  played a major role in bringing to life some of the most richly-detailed and
  realistic multi-player simulations to ever exist in Cyberspace.


  Duncan Howard ......................................... [duncan@phantom.com]

  Heads the End of The Line experimental LP-Mud system, which has been  online
  for  the better part of 5 years as these words are written.  He has been in-
  volved with working  on  Multi-User-Dimensions  for  many  years,  including
  design  work on the first MUD to ever exist (Richard Bartle's MUD I, a modi-
  fied version of this program can be seen  still  running  on  Compu$erve  as
  British  Legends).   Duncan is putting together the research and development
  division of Phantom Access as it pertains to online multi-user virtual real-
  ities and role playing games.


  David Schenfeld ......................................... [dave@phantom.com]

  Set up and fine-tuned many of the underlying programs and shellscripts  that
  make  the  system function as a congruous whole.  He is also responsible for
  designing and coding many of the applications that  are  present  under  the
  VOICES  layer,  or  reside  within  the externals that Vox launches when you
  select them.

  RADAR but doesn't FLY of anything.  Do not be alarmed.
