 Summary: Amusing Pac-man ripoff where the object is to eat as many sweets as possible. 
Plot: Four jawbreakers chase after your pair of teeth which attempts to clear the board of dots a Pac-Man like game. To the left of the monster pen is an alley where you can pick up various sweets, and you have four power-up pills. The main problem is that the monsters always come out of the pen the same way--and they are still "blue" when they do. 

Graphics: when you finish a level, the word "winner!" pops up on the screen and a toothbrush comes out to brush your teeth. You get an extra level, too. Jawbreakers are all the same except for their color. You don't get to see your score until after the level's complete(at which time you get an extra set of teeth). However, when you are touched by a monster, you get to see your teeth fall out, which is quite funny. Sound: clacking of teeth as you eat the dots--which must be sugar pills. Even without eating monsters, you still get your teeth brushed. 

Controls: arrow keys. No way to pause your character unless you run into a side wall. 

Replayability: not much. The monsters aren't very smart and always follow the same pattern(it gets a little faster, and fighting fatigue is a challenge, technically, but that's it), and the levels are all the same. This game's prequel, Gobbler, is much more difficult, as is Taxman, a total Pac-man ripoff which just has different ghost names, patterns, and "treats" beneath the ghosts' pen, or Pigpen, which has pigs in place of ghosts and invisible dots.
