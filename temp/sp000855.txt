                             THE LEVELLERS:

                     A CHRONOLOGY AND BIBLIOGRAPHY

                           By Roderick Moore

The members of the political movement known to history as the Levellers 
were active for four years in the 1640s, during the English Civil War.  
They were far ahead of their time in their political thinking, and they 
may justly be called the first libertarians in the world.  There is an 
extensive literature about them, but most of it has been written by 
socialists, and some of the most highly regarded authorities are 
Marxists, so the reader can easily gain a false impression of what the 
movement stood for.  

This Study Guide is designed to direct students of history to the most 
reliable sources of information on the Levellers, and also to indicate 
where some of the Levellers' own writings can be found reprinted, so 
that they can be judged by their own words rather than by the 
distortions of socialist historians.  At a time when our national 
independence is threatened by the advance of federalism, it is more 
important than ever for us to be conscious of our political heritage, 
and the Levellers are a crucial part of this heritage which should not 
be neglected.

                 A CHRONOLOGY OF THE LEVELLER MOVEMENT

April 1645

John Lilburne, a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Parliamentarian Army, resigns 
his commission on grounds of conscience.  All officers are being 
required to sign the Solemn League and Covenant, which implies support 
for Presbyterianism, but Lilburne is an Independent (i.e. a 
Congregationalist).  In London Lilburne starts to gather a group of 
friends and supporters around him, including William Walwyn and Richard 
Overton.

July 1645

Lilburne arrested and imprisoned for slandering William Lenthall, the 
Speaker of the House of Commons, whom he accuses of corresponding with 
Royalists.

October 1645

Lilburne released after petition to House of Commons by over two 
thousand leading London citizens.

June 1646

Lilburne arrested and imprisoned for slandering the Earl of Manchester, 
whom he accuses of protecting an officer who has been charged with 
treason.

July 1646

Oxford surrenders.  End of the first phase of the Civil War, except for 
a few isolated Royalist garrisons.

August 1646

Overton arrested and imprisoned for printing without a licence.

March 1647

Harlech Castle surrenders.  End of the first phase of the Civil War.

Discontent spreads through the Parliamentarian Army about pay arrears, 
lack of indemnity for wartime acts and arrangements for drafting to 
Ireland.

April 1647

Soldiers in contact with Lilburne's movement start electing "Agitators" 
(delegates) to take their grievances to Parliament.

May 1647

Under pressure from Agitators, who threaten mutiny, Sir Thomas Fairfax 
(commander-in-chief) agrees to call a rally of the whole Army to plan 
action.

June 1647

Agitators take Charles I into their own custody so that Parliament 
cannot negotiate a separate deal with him.  Cornet George Joyce leads a 
force which brings the King from Holmby House (Northamptonshire) to 
Newmarket.

Rally of the Army on Newmarket Heath.  Soldiers defy Parliament by 
refusing to disband until grievances redressed.  General Council of the 
Army is formed, representing officers and men.

Second rally on Triploe Heath (Cambridgeshire).  General Council adopts 
a political program incorporating some ideas from Lilburne's movement.

July 1647

Mob incited by Presbyterians (the most conservative Parliamentar- ian 
faction) invades Parliament and forces it to pass motions taking control 
of the London militia (a potential rival army) and inviting the King to 
London for talks.

August 1647

Army marches into London and occupies it without bloodshed.

Parliament reverses motions passed under duress.

September 1647

Overton released from jail.

October 1647

Agitators from five regiments present "The Case of the Army Truly 
Stated" to Fairfax as a manifesto.  The Putney Debates (28th October - 
11th November).  General Council considers the first Agreement of the 
People, a proposed new constitution based on "The Case of the Army".  A 
split appears between Lilburne's movement and the senior officers, known 
as "Grandees". Lilburne's supporters are nicknamed "Levellers" for the 
first time by Grandee spokesmen Oliver Cromwell (second-in-command) and 
Henry Ireton.  Colonel Thomas Rainsborough (M.P. for Droitwich) emerges 
as the highest-ranking Leveller sympathiser in the Army.  Other Leveller 
spokesmen are Agitators Edward Sexby and William Allen, and civilians 
John Wildman and Maximilian Petty.

November 1647

Attempted mutiny by Leveller soldiers at Corkbush Field, near Ware 
(Hertfordshire).  Called off after an appeal by Fairfax and Cromwell.  
One soldier executed.  A serious setback for the movement.

March 1648

Governor of Pembroke Castle declares support for the King.  Start of the 
second phase of the Civil War.

July 1648

"The Moderate", a Leveller weekly newspaper, starts publication.  
Gilbert Mabbott editor.

August 1648

Lilburne released from jail after petition to House of Commons by 
supporters.

October 1648

Cromwell enters Edinburgh.  End of the second phase of the Civil War, 
except for isolated Royalist garrisons in Yorkshire.

Rainsborough killed by Royalist raiding party at Doncaster.

November 1648

Cromwell worried about the strength of the Presbyterians in Parliament, 
who still want a compromise with the King.  Invites Levellers to meet 
Grandees for new talks about a constitutional settlement.

December 1648

Pride's Purge.  Colonel Thomas Pride bars Presbyterian M.P.s from House 
of Commons.  Balance of power tilts towards Grandees.

The Whitehall Debates (14th December - 13th January). Levellers present 
the second Agreement of the People to the General Council of Officers, 
which rejects it because of proposals for religious toleration.

January 1649

Charles I tried and executed for treason against the people.

February 1649

House of Commons votes to abolish monarchy and House of Lords, and 
appoints Council of State as executive authority.

Leveller activity in Army intensifies.  Grandees ban petitions to 
Parliament by soldiers.

Lilburne writes "England's New Chains Discovered", condemning Grandees 
and Council of State for exercising arbitrary power.

March 1649

Eight Leveller troopers go to Fairfax and demand the restoration of the 
right to petition.  Five of them are cashiered.

Lilburne writes "The Second Part of England's New Chains Discovered", 
repeating his attacks.

Pontefract Castle surrenders.  End of the second phase of the Civil War.

Lilburne, Walwyn, Overton and Thomas Prince (Leveller treasurer) 
arrested for treason by order of the Council of State.

                       BOOKS ABOUT THE LEVELLERS

AYLMER, G.E. (ed.)
The Levellers in the English Revolution
Thames and Hudson, London, 1975
Contains 12 Leveller pamphlets and petitions (some of them abridged), 
extracts from the Putney and Whitehall Debates, and a 47-page historical 
Introduction.  A very useful introductory work, giving a well-balanced 
account of the movement.

BRAILSFORD, H.N.
The Levellers and the English Revolution
Spokesman, Nottingham, 1976 (first published 1961)
The most comprehensive history of the Levellers.  Unfortunately the 
author was a Marxist.  Provides some important pieces of information 
which cannot be found in any of the other sources listed here, but it is 
constantly necessary to make allowances for Brailsford's political 
views, which intrude throughout.  A book which should be treated with 
caution, especially regarding William Walwyn, whom the author tries to 
turn into a socialist by bending the evidence.

FRANK, Joseph
The Levellers
Russell and Russell, New York, 1969 (first published 1955)
Traces the history of the Levellers through the writings of John 
Lilburne, William Walwyn and Richard Overton.  An objective and 
comprehensive account of the development of their ideas.  Sometimes 
rather sketchy about background events, but still highly recommendable.

GREGG, Pauline
Free-Born John
Dent, London, 1986 (first published 1961)
A comprehensive biography of John Lilburne (1615-1657), the leader of 
the Levellers.  Factual and very informative.  The author's socialist 
views only show through in one or two places, mainly in the last 
chapter.

HALLER, William, and DAVIES, Godfrey (eds.)
The Leveller Tracts, 1647-1653
Peter Smith., Gloucester (Massachusetts), 1964 (first published 1944) 
Contains 17 pamphlets and petitions by or about the Levellers, and a 
50-page historical Introduction.  Useful and informative.

MACMICHAEL, Jack R., and TAFT, Barbara (eds.)
The Writings of William Walwyn
University of Georgia Press, Athens (Georgia), 1989. William Walwyn 
(1600-1680) was the theorist of the Leveller movement, while John 
Lilburne was the man of action.  This book contains 31 pamphlets by 
Walwyn on politics, religion and medicine, along with a 51-page 
biographical Introduction.  An insight into the mind of a truly 
compassionate man.

MORTON, A.L. (ed.)
Freedom in Arms
Lawrence and Wishart, London, 1975
Contains 19 Leveller pamphlets and letters.  Also includes a 59 page 
historical Introduction, which reflects the author's Marxist views in 
places, but is still quite informative.

SHAW, Howard
The Levellers
Longmans, London, 1968
A concise history of the movement and its religious, political and 
economic background.  A good introductory work, generally fair and 
balanced, although in a few places the author seems to have relied on 
socialist sources.

WOLFE, Don M. (ed.)
Leveller Manifestoes of the Puritan Revolution
Humanities Press, New York, 1967 (first published 1944)
Contains 20 pamphlets and petitions by the Levellers, about them or 
relevant to them.  Also includes an Introduction extending to 108 pages 
which gives a fair and well-balanced account of the movement's history.

Shorter Works About the Levellers

HOILE, David
The Levellers: Libertarian Radicalism and the English Civil War.

The only works published in Britain in recent years which deal with the 
Levellers from an explicitly libertarian point of view.  Both well worth 
reading.
