TOFU BURGERS

2 pounds soft tofu
3 large carrots
1 large onion
2 large cloves garlic
4 or 5 large eggs
1 cup soy or tamari sauce
1 to 3 cups whole wheat flour (see text)
1 to 2 tablespoons hot curry powder
or
2 tablespoons ground cumin and
1 tablespoon coriander

Place tofu and soy sauce in a large bowl. Grate carrots and add to bowl.
Dice onions and garlic and add to bowl. Add eggs and spices to bowl and
thoroughly mix ingredients with either a blender or a potato masher.
Gradually stir in flour until you reach a consistency where the mixture
will stick to a spoon rather than slide off. Yields 12 to 15 large patties.
These burgers will generally keep for up to two weeks in a refrigerator.
Don't freeze this mixture, though, as if you do it'll lose all of its
cohesion.

Cook in pre-heated cat iron skillet lightly coated with oil. Cook for 3 to
5 minutes per side. These burgers can be somewhat crumbly, so it's a good
idea to put a thin slice of cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese on top of the
patties after you've flipped them, and then cover the skillet so the cheese
will melt. Serve on bread or buns with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and mustard.
