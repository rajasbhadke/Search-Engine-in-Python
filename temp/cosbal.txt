   COSMIC BALANCE is a simulation of tactical combat in deep space.  You design
your ships, give them their orders, and then see how they perform in combat
against enemy ships.
   There is very little involved.  The outcome will depend almost entirely upon
your judgement as a designer and your skill as a commander.

The game is played in three phases:

THE SETUP PHASE
   You choose one to six different tactical scenarios, and then design up to
four different ships on each side to fight them.

THE ORDERS PHASE
   Your map will show you the positions of your ships and the enemy ships.  You
give each ship its orders for a sixteen-second turn.  Your ships may maneuver, change course, fire weapons, or try to beam a boarding party onto an enemy ship
   Your Opponent will then give his orders for the same turn.

THE EXECUTION PHASE
   You will now watch the ships battle each other, each following the instruc-
tions given them during the orders phase.  THe scenario will end when all of
your ships or all the enemy ships have been destroyed.  When one or both
players have run away, or when one player has achieved the victory conditions
given for that scenario.

NEW GAME OR SAVED GAME
   If NEW GAME is highlighted, you begin a fresh scenario.  Later, you may wish
to recall a game you played earlier and saved.  Press 1, and SAVED GAME will be
highlighted.  If you requested a saved game, you will be asked the name you
gave the game when you saved it.

SOLITAIRE OR TWO PLAYER?
   If TWO PLAYER is highlighted, the computer will set up a game between you
and a human opponent.  If you wish to play the computer, press 2.  SOLITAIRE
will be highlighted.

SOLITAIRE LEVEL
   If you decide to play solitaire, you may decide the level of sophistication,
from 1 to 4, of your enemy's ships.  A level One enemy will have a ship
technology equal to your ship; a level Four enemy will have a crew efficiency
3 better than the ship's design and 3 more power points per engine.  To raise
the level of difficulty, continue pressing 2 until the level you wish is
highlighted.

   Victory points are awarded to each ship according to how well it has
survived combat during the scenarios.  The victory points won by a ship depend
upon its size and tech level, less the critical damage received.

VICTORY POINTS FOR UNDAMAGED SHIPS
The values of undamaged ships are shown on this table:
                   Tech level   -1-     -2-     -3-     -4-     -5-     -6-
Size 1 Corvette                   4       5       6       7       8       9
Size 2 Frigate                   12      14      17      21      25      29
Size 3 Destroyer                 25      31      21      49      60      71
Size 4 Cruiser                   58      72      86     105     125     150
Size 5 Dreadnought              105     130     155     180     210     250

For example, the largest, most advanced ship, a tech 6 Dreadnought, would score
250 victory points if it survived the scenario without damage.

VICTORY POINTS FOR DAMAGED SHIPS
   Each time a ship suffers critical damage, a percentage of victory points
equal to the percentage of critical hits is subtracted from the Victory Points.
For example, suppose the Tech 6 dreadnought has suffered 8 critical hits, this
is 50 percent of its critical hit allowance.  The same percentage (50%) will be
taken from the total number of Victory Points, so the 250 point ship will now
be worth only 125 Victory Points.

VICTORY POINTS FOR CAPTURED SHIPS
   If you capture an enemy ship, its victory points are added to yours.

** The player with the most victory points at the ed of the game is the winner.

SCENARIO ONE:  DEEPSPACE ENCOUNTER
   In one famous deepspace battle the Starship Enterprise fought the Starship
Reliant just inside the remote boundary of the Alliance.
   Player One commands the Enterprise.
   Player Two commands the Reliant.

THE SHIPS
   Both ships were roughly equal, tech level five size 4 cruisers, with range
factors of two.

ORDERS TO THE ENTERPRISE COMMANDER
   Destroy or capture the Reliant.

ORDERS TO THE RELIANT COMMANDER
   Destroy or capture the Enterprise.

ESCAPE CONDITIONS
   The Reliant Commander needs two range factors, that is, two working warp
drives to escape.  Enterprise needs just one drive.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
   Each ship begins the scenario with 125 victory points.  Whichever ship has
the most at the end is the victor.
   Since the battle is fought in Alliance space, the Reliant will need its
extra range factors to escape.  If the Reliant's Warp Drives are destroy, it
cannot escape the Scenario--it must fight until the end

TIME LIMIT
   No time limit.


SCENARIO TWO:  PLANETARY RAID
   An Alliance Dreadnought was ordered to attack the planet Dirgos, which had
been turned into a fueling base for Brotherhood raiders.
   Player One commands the Alliance Dreadnought.
   Player Two commands the defenders of Dirgos.

THE SHIPS
   The Alliance Dreadnought must have at least two to accomplish its mission.
The Brotherhood Defense Squadron consists of three Size 3 Destroyers.  They
need no extra range factors.

THE PLANET DIRGOS
   Call from the game disk (the planets are saved on the game disk) "Planet 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, or 6," depending on the tech level of the defending ships. (Don's
put a space between Planet the tech level.)  On the screen the Planet Dirgos
will appear will appear as a dreadnought.  It will not move or fire weapons,
but the base is heavily armored against enemy weapons.


                       - The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 3 -


ORDERS TO THE ALLIANCE COMMANDER
   Penetrate the defending squadron and reduce the enemy base.

ORDERS TO THE RELIANCE COMMANDER
   Repel any attack on Dirgos.

ESCAPE CONDITIONS
   The Alliance ship needs two range factors to escape.  Brotherhood ships
cannot escape.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
   The victory point value of the Alliance attacker depends on its tech level.
The Brotherhood destroyers are worth only 1/4 of their normal victory point
value, since their mission is to defend the planet.  The Planet Dirgos is worth
as many points as a Size Five Dreadnought.  At the end or the scenario, the
player with the most victory points is the winner.

TIME LIMIT
   At the end of ten turns the Alliance Dreadnought automatically attempts to
warp out.


SCENARIO THREE:  COMMERCE RAIDER
   An Alliance Cruiser was ordered to intercept a Brotherhood Transport
Dreadnought deep in Brotherhood Space, before it reached home port with a
precious cargo of fuel crystals.

THE SHIPS
   The Alliance commerce raider is a Size Four Cruiser, with a range of at
least two.  The Brotherhood Transport Dreadnought needs a range on only one,
but must have seven cargo holds.

ORDERS TO ALLIANCE COMMANDER
   Wreck or capture the transport before it can escape, or destroy its cargo.

ORDERS TO THE BROTHERHOOD COMMANDER
   Bring your cargo safely to your home port.

ESCAPE CONDITIONS
   The Alliance ship needs two range factors to escape.  The Brotherhood
transport needs one.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
   The Alliance ship's ship's victory point value us the usual value for a
cruiser, depending upon its tech level.  The Brotherhood Transport's value is
calculated this way: The normal victory point value of a Size Five Dreadnought,
modified by four, plus, the normal victory point value divided by sixteen,
times the number of cargo holds remaining intact.

TIME LIMIT
   At the end of ten turns the Brotherhood Transport automatically attempts to
warp out.

SCENARIO FOUR:  INVASION
   An Alliance Fleet was ordered to establish a forward base in the Pegasus
Constellation, deep within Brotherhood Space.
   Player One in the Invasion Fleet Commander
   Player Two commands the Brother Defense Force.

THE SHIPS
   The Alliance Invasion Force consists of:
-- one Size Five Dreadnought, with a range of at least two
-- three Size Four Cruisers with a range of at least two
   The ships must carry at least three battalions of troops.  Each battalion
occupies a tech sector; nine cubic sectors, plus a number of sectors equal to
the tech level of the ship.  The troops may be placed aboard one ship, or
placed on more than one ship.
   NOTE FROM ERRATA:  Battalions are automatically loaded into the Alliance
                      expedition's cargo holds; thus, the Alliance must build
                      at least three cargo holds.

   The Brotherhood Defense Force consists of:
-- one Size Five Dreadnought, with a range of at least one.
-- three Size Three Destroyers, without range.

ORDERS TO THE ALLIANCE COMMANDER
   Carry at least three battalions of troops the Brotherhood Defenders.

ORDERS TO THE BROTHERHOOD COMMANDER
   Destroy the invading force, or kill enough to make any invasion impractical.

ESCAPE CONDITIONS
  The Alliance invading ships need two range factors to escape. The Brotherhood
Dreadnought needs one.  The Brotherhood destroyers cannot escape.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
   Victory points will be awarded for:
1. All surviving ships, in the usual manner.
2. Control of the Pegasus Constellation.  If the Alliance fleet still has three
   battalions of troops intact on the battle space at the end of the scenario,
   its invasion can succeed.  The Alliance will be awarded extra victory points
   equal to 5/4ths of the value of a dreadnought.  If less than three
   battalions of troops have survived, the Brotherhood player will be awarded
   these extra points.

TIME LIMIT
   No time limit.


SCENARIO FIVE:  DOGFIGHT
   Alliance and Brotherhood Squadrons patrolling in deep space sometimes ran
head-on into each other, resulting in dogfights.

SELECTING A RANDOM ENEMY FLEET
   If you are playing solitaire, and you want to make the scenarios more
realistic by fighting against ships whose weapons and defenses you haven't just
designed, we suggest the following:
Design six (or twelve) different types of enemy ships.



                       - The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 6 -

-- Number and save these design.
-- When it's time to set up the enemy fleet, use a non-digital random number
generator (otherwise known as a die) to choose the enemy ships.  If you have a
second computer, you can also use it to generate a random number, but a die is
cheaper, and you don;t have to learn basic.

   The SPACE LEFT is the amount of space available inside the ship you have
chosen to design.  You must design your ship within the limitations of this
space.  As you design your ship, the space left number will decrease with the
creation of various systems.
   The SPACE LEFT was decided by the size and tech level of the ship you chose,
determined by the formula Space=(9+Tech Level) times 2 to the (Size minus one)
power.
   In the sample display above, a tech six dreadnought has 240 available cubic
sectors.  Twenty are automatically allotted to the hull.

hull space.
   You must also allow one cubic sector for each detachment of marines you are
carrying.  If you have a minimum crew space of 20, and are carrying four

LIGHT PHASER
   A light phaser is a high-energy beam weapon that can hardly melt through the
skin of an enemy ship.

HEAVY PHASER
   A heavy phaser has a wider, more destructive beam than a light phaser.

SIEGE PHASER
   Siege phasers were developed to destroy the warning stars and fortress stars
that guard the boundary line.  Their beams can cause twice the damage of a
light phaser.

PHOTON TORPEDOES
   Photon Torpedoes are designed to break down an enemy's shields.  By striking
a shield with many frequencies

DISRUPTERS
   Disrupters are the longest-range weapons in a ship's arsenal, capable of hitting a ship as many as one hundred lightmils away.  However they are less
accurate, and they can be evaded by a fast-moving ship.

PLASMA TORPEDOES
   Large and slow-moving, plasma torpedoes make up for awkwardness with a huge
warhead.  A hit by a plasma torpedo at close range can cause as many as sixty
factors of damage, demolishing even a large ship.  The farther they travel to
their target, the less their effect.  Unlike phasers or photon torpedoes, plasma
torpedoes do not have a limited arc of fire.  They will automatically go in the
direction of their target.

degrees.                                         |____________________________|
   The number of degrees you can change during
each second of the turn is decided by the Maximum Acceleration factor of your
ship.  This was determined at the start of the game by the size of your ship
and the number of drives you built into it.
   For example, suppose your ship is traveling on course 180 and your ship has
a maximum acceleration factor of 4.  You enter your desired course as 200
degrees.
   If in the first second of it's course change, your ship would be able to
turn to course 184.  After two seconds, your ship would be on course 188.  On
the fifth second of your turn, your ship will reach course 200.
   If, on the other hand, your ship was traveling on course 180 and you
ordered a change to course 45, and the maximum acceleration of your ship would
only be able to come around to course 116 in the sixteen seconds of the turn.
You would have to continue your intended course change the next turn.

WHAT TIME POINT?
   You may designate the second from one to sixteen, that you would like your
course change to begin.  You can change course more than once in a single turn,
but not, of course, more than sixteen times.

POWER REQUIRED:
   If you change course during a turn, your ship uses up extra energy units.
The number of energy units depends upon the size of a ship, the number of
functioning drives, and how fast you were going when you decided to change
course.

                       - The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 19 -

   You may also choose to increase or decrease speed during this part of of the
Orders Phase.  Press S for:

(S)PEED CHANGE
   The computer will ask:
WHAT SPEED?
   The minimum and maximum speed you can go, measured in sublight speed pulse
factors, will appear on your screen.  For instance, if your ship is traveling
at speed 4, and you have a maximum acceleration rate of 2, your display will
read:
(2-6)
   This tells you that, at the speed you are going and with the number of
drives you have, you cannot reach a speed greater than 6 or less than 2 during
this turn.

MAXIMUM ACCELERATION
   Your maximum acceleration factor during each turn will change, depending
upon your present speed and the number of functioning drives you have left.  In
effect the faster you are going, the more drives are used in overhead, leaving
less drives for positive (or negative) acceleration.

POWER USED
   An increase or decrease in speed, like a course change, uses extra power
units.  If you both increase speed and change course in the same turn, however,
you will only expend the power needed for the speed change, the course change
will not use any extra energy.  (Exception:  the drag chute effect)

THE DRAG CHUTE EFFECT
   You will discover that starships require as much energy to slow down as they do to speed up.  A ship whose drives have been shot out by enemy fire, or whose drives are all engaged keeping the ship at maximum speed, has no way to slow down.
   Ingenious starship commanders solved this problem by using the drag chute
effect; by extending their solar panels, they were able to catch the almost
imperceptible push of starlight and use it like a parachute.
   Using this method, it is possible to reduce speed one pulse factor each turn
without any cost of energy, and without and need to use drives.
   This unorthodox method can only be used if you have no drives to use, or if
you are traveling so fast that your drives cannot slow you down.  And, if you
are using the drag chute effect, you cannot change course.  Any course change
already ordered that turn will be eliminated.

   You also may charge or drain your shields during the Orders Phase.
   Your status column on your Status Display  tells you the current readiness
of your shields.






                       - The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 20 -

   For Example:
SHIELD 1: 10/0
SHIELD 2: 1/0
SHIELD 3: 1/0
SHIELD 4: 1/0
SHIELD 5: 1/0
SHIELD 6: 1/0
SHIELD 7: 1/0
SHIELD 8: 10/0
  The ship in this example has strong shields protecting its bow, arcs 1 and 8,
and a single shield strength around the rest of the ship.

SHIELD 1: 10/0
   The 10 after the shield number tells you the strength that was given to that
shield during the design phase.  That shield can deflect up to 10 damage
factors from an enemy weapon.  The 0 after the 10 tells you that no batteries
need re-charging;  that shield is at full power.
   But suppose that your ship has been hit by enemy fire during the previous
turn.  Your Shield Status Column may show.
SHIELD 1: 5/38
   This tells you that Shield 1 has been hit by enemy fire, and reduced from
Strength 10 to Strength 5.  It also tells you that, in order to bring it back
up to full strength, you must recharge 38 shield batteries.  To do this, press
C for:

(C)HARGE
   The computer will ask you which shield to charge.  In this example, press 1.
   It will now ask how many energy units to put into charging the batteries:
0-38.
   If you enter 30, the shield will be restored to full strength.  The Status
Display will again show:
SHIELD 1: 10/0
DAMAGED AND DESTROYED SHIELDS
   After being hit by enemy fire, your Status Display may show:
SHIELD 1: 2/0
   Sixty-four of this shield's batteries have been destroyed, reducing its
strength from ten to two.  The zero tells you that no amount of energy can
restore this shield's to it's original strength.  If the status reads:
SHIELD 1: 0/0
   It means all the batteries have been destroyed.  It is no longer possible to
shield it's arc.
   If your POWER REMAINING is seriously low, you can drain power from a charged
Shield and put it into your ship's other systems.  Press D for:

(D)RAIN SHIELD
   The display will ask:
WHICH SHIELD?
   In this example, type Shield 1.
DRAIN HOW MUCH POWER (0-80)?
   In this example, press 40.
   The Status Display will change from:
SHIELD 1: 10/0
   to:
SHIELD 1: 5/40
                       - The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 21 -

   At the same time, the POWER REMAINING will increase from:
POWER REMAINING: 15
   to
POWER REMAINING: 25
   As you see, this is not an efficient way to get power.  For every 4 shield
battery units you drain, only 1 additional energy unit is added to your power
remaining.
   It is also possible to drain power from one shield and move it to another
shield.  For example, suppose your Status Display shows:
SHIELD 1: 10/0
SHIELD 2: 0/6
   Suppose you expect to be hit on Shield 2, but don't have enough POWER
REMAINING to recharge it.  Press T for:

(T)RANSFER
   The computer will ask:
CHARGE WHAT SHIELD?
   Press 2.  The computer will ask:
DRAIN WHAT SHIELD?
   ENTER 1.  The computer will ask:
HOW MUCH ENERGY (0-12)?
   Enter 12.
   The Status Display will show:
SHIELD 1: 8/12
SHIELD 2: 1/0
   Of your twelve energy points, six were added to shield two, bringing its
number of charged batteries up to eight, enough for one full strength.  As you
see, this is an inefficient source of power; for each two shield batteries you
drained, only one energy point actually reached the other shield.  But, in an
emergency, it may be your only choice.
   Notice also that you may move less than eight points at a time, or more than
eight, but in determining shield strength, you must have a full eight batteries
for each strength point.  For example, fifteen charged batteries would give
only one strength point: sixteen charged batteries would give a strength of two

   During the Orders Phase, you have the option of charging and firing your
weapons.  Press W for:

(W)EAPONS
   Most of your weapons must be charged before they can be fired.  Some, like
phasers and photon torpedoes, can be fired in the same turn as they are
charged.  Others, like disrupters and plasma torpedoes, take two or three turns
to charge before they can fired.
   The status of each of your weapons is shown on your Status Display:
1) SIEGE 0/ /
2) PHOTON 0/ /
3) PLASMA 0/ /
   Weapon number 1 is a Siege Phaser; weapon 2 is a Photon Torpedo, and weapon
3 is a Plasma Torpedo.  THe 0 after each weapon tells you they have not been
charged.
   If you wish to charge your weapons, press C for:
                       - The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 22 -

(C)HARGE
   You will be asked which weapons you wish to charge.  Press the number of each weapon, without commas between.  For weapons 10, 11, and 12, press 0,:, and -. (zero, colon and hyphen, respectively)
   In our example, press 123 RETURN.
   The status display will now ship:
1) SIEGE 1/ /
2) PHOTON 1/ /
3) PLASMA 1/ /
   The 1 after each weapon tells you that it has been charged one turn.  Each 1
will be highlighted, to tell you that it was charged that turn.
   LIGHT PHASERS, HEAVY PHASERS, SIEGE PHASERS and PHOTON TORPEDOES may be fired in the same turn that they are charged.

DISRUPTERS
   Need to be charged during two consecutive turns.  They are ready to fire
during the second turn.

PLASMA TORPEDOES
   Need to be charged three consecutive turns.  They are ready to fire during
the third turn.
   If a weapon is not charged in a given turn, it loses all its accumulated
charge.  All weapons must be used when ready, or that charge is wasted.

POWER NEEDED
        Light Phasers        1 energy unit per turn for one turn
        Heavy Phasers        1 energy unit per turn for one turn
        Siege Phasers        2 energy units per turn for one turn
        Photon Torpedoes     5 energy units per turn for one turn
        Disruptors           2 energy units per turn for two turns
        Plasma Torpedoes     5 energy units per turn for three turns

FIRING WEAPONS
   Before you fire your weapons, you should be certain that:
1. The weapons have been charged the correct number of turns.
2. The enemy will be within range if you fire.  The Identify command will tell
   you his range at the beginning of the turn.  You must guess what he will do.
3. If you are going to fire a phaser, disruptor or photon torpedo, will your
   weapon be facing the enemy?  The Identify command will tell you which of your
   shields are facing the enemy at the beginning of the turn.
   You should also consider the characteristics of each weapon.

DRAINING SHIELDS
   Weapons that drain shields cause normal damage and in  addition drain four
shield batteries for each damage point.  For example, suppose a shield with
this status:                     SHIELD 1: 10/0
is hit by a photon torpedo.  The photon torpedo will overwhelm the shields as a
normal weapon would, using ten of its damage factors to drain the shield and
causing four factors of damage to the ship.  In addition to this, however, the
photon torpedo will drain four batteries for each of its fourteen factors.  The
shield will be left this way:
                   SHIELD 1: 1/66    ( 10 + ( 4 x 14 ) = 66 )

WEAPONS CHARACTERISTICS
   The effective weapons ranges shown on the chart in Appendix B are for a tech
level two ship with an efficiency level of two.  The ranges on the ship with a
lower efficiency or tech level will be less, and will be longer for a ship with
a greater efficiency and tech level.  For instance, the weapons on a tech six
ship with a crew efficiency of three will have nearly double the effective
range shown on the chart.

MODE OF ATTACK?
   You may choose the second during the turn in which you wish your weapon to fire, with one of these options:

(R)ANGE
   As soon as the target is within the range you specify, the weapon will fire.

(T)IME
   You may specify the second of your turn when you wish your weapon to fire.

(L)AST INSTANT
   The weapon will wait until the best possible moment to fire.  It will:
+ Hold fire until the last second while the range is decreasing, but fire
immediately if the range begins to increase again, or:
+ Fire instantly, if it appears that the target is going to move out of the
current arc of fire.
   This mode only works if your weapon is aimed at the target to begin with.
If it's not able to shoot at the beginning of the turn, it won't shoot at all.
   When  you have given a weapon the order to fire, it will be shown on your
status display.  For example.
                                 1) SIEGE 1/L/E

   This command cancels the order to fire all guided weapons that have not left
the ship.  Once a guided weapon has left the ship, however, it cannot be
stopped.
   If you decide not to use a weapon, press D for:
                       - The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 24 -

(D)RAIN
   The computer will ask:
WHICH WEAPONS?
   Enter the number of weapons.  Again, weapons 10, 11 and 12 are represented
by zero, colon and hyphen.
   The power status of that weapon will no longer be highlighted and the number
of turns charged will return to what it was at the beginning of the orders
phase.
   You can only drain a weapon which has been charged that turn; you cannot use
weapons charged in earlier turns as an auxiliary power source.
   If you try to charge, drain, or fire the same weapon twice, or a non-existent
weapon, the computer will warn you:
ILLEGAL WEAPON.

(B)ELTS
   Belts are your first line of defense against enemy guided weapons.  Each
belt, a small, phaser-armed satellite fires, one after the other, at approaching
enemy seekers, plasma torpedoes, or fighters.  Each belt has one chance in four
of shooting down a fighter, one in eight of shooting down a heavy or light
seeker, and one in four of weakening the blast of a plasma torpedo.  The more
belts you have, therefore, the better your chance of shooting down the enemy
weapon.
   Once a belt has been charged, it keeps its charge until it fires ar an enemy
weapon.
   To charge your belts, press B, and then enter the number of your belts you
wish charged.  Your status display will show you the number of your belts that
are ready.

POWER REQUIRES:
   One energy unit per belt.

ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES (ECM)
   Electronic Countermeasures, (ECM), or jammers, are systems that confuse
approaching fighters, seekers, photon, and plasma torpedoes, by jamming their
guidance systems and projecting ghost targets.  Your ship carries ECM jammers
of a strength equal to its tech level.  Each level of ECM reduces the damage
caused by an enemy guided weapon by one factor, or makes the chance of a hit by
an enemy phaser, disruptor, or photon torpedo less likely.  Plasma torpedoes
are also weakened by ECM.
   For example, if you have charged six factors of ECM, and you are hit by an
enemy light seeker, the damage that the light seeker causes will be reduced
from 12 factors to 6 factors.
   To charge your ECM, press J for (J)AM and enter the number of levels, up to your tech level, that you wish to charge.  If you have a tech six ship, and you charge all your ECM, your status display will now show:
                                    ECM:6





                       -  The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 25 -

ELECTRONIC COUNTER-COUNTERMEASURES (ECCM)
   Your ship is also equipped with Electronic Counter-Countermeasures.  These
systems can sift through the chaos of electronic noise thrown out by enemy ECM
to find real targets.  If you are firing phasers, photons, or disruptors, each
level of your ECCM cancels out one level of the enemy's ECM.  For example, if
your ship has an ECCM level of 6, and the enemy ship has an ECM level of 6 or
less, your phasers will be just as effective as if the enemy had no ECM at all.
   The maximum level of your ECCM equals your tech level, and is shown on your
status display after SENSOR.
   To charge your ECCM, press E.  You may enter any number of energy units up
to your tech level.
   If your tech level is six, your status display will show:
                                    ECCM:6

EVASIVE MANEUVERS
   Evasive maneuvering is another way to avoid an enemy seeker, torpedo or
fighter swarm.  Also high speed may cause the enemy weapon to miss.  It is
especially difficult to hit a fast-moving target with a very long range weapon,
such as a disruptor.

   You may use your transporters to beam up parties or marines to a friendly
ship, or board  an enemy ship.
   Press T for:

(T)RANSPORT
   The computer will ask:
HOW MANY MARINES TO TRANSPORT (0-20)?
   You may beam twice as many parties as you have transporters; in this
example, twenty.
   Your number of transporters is shown on your status display after TRANS.
   The computer will next ask:
WHAT SHIP IS TARGET?
   Type the initial letter of the target ship and press RETURN.  The number of
marines ready to beam will now appear on your status display after TRANSPORTER.

POWER REQUIRED:
   One energy unit per transporter.

TRANSPORTING TO A FRIENDLY SHIP
   You can transport marines at any time to a friendly ship.  You can also
transport marines onto a ship which has been boarded by the enemy, if combat is
still going on, to aid in its defense.
   Your marines, regardless of their efficiency level, will assume the
efficiency level of the crew and marines of the friendly ship they beam
aboard.  If they are sent to reinforce your marines fighting on an enemy ship,
they will take on the efficiency level of your marines already on that ship.





                       - The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 26 -

BOARDING AN ENEMY SHIP
   Ordinarily, you can beam marines onto an enemy ship only if no charged enemy
shield is facing you.  However, it is possible to beam aboard a protected enemy
ship if you can seriously breach his shield.  If you can cause its shield five
damage points more than needed to breach it, your marines will be able to board
his ship.  Your sensors will be able to detect the breached shield, and will
choose that second for the marines to beam across.
   If you try to beam marines onto an enemy ship while its shields are intact,
your beaming will fail, and your marines will remain on board your ship.

ON-SHIP COMBAT
   The battle between boarding marines and defenders will begin at the end of
the turn, and may last several turns, until either the ship's defenders or the
boarding marines are eliminated.
   If the battle lasts several turns, you will still be able to issue orders to
your ship, even if there are enemy marines on board.  You will be able to see
the progress of the battle on your Status Display.  If the number of total
defenders falls to 0, the enemy has captured your ship.
   The success or failure of your boarding party will be decided by these
factors:
        1. The number and effectiveness rating of the boarding marines.
        2. The number and effectiveness rating of the defending marines.
        3. The number and effectiveness rating of the defending crew.
        4. Defending troops traveling as cargo.

CAPTURED SHIPS
   If your boarding party successfully overwhelms the enemy defenders, the ship
is captured.  Thereafter in the scenario, that ship is part of your fleet, you
may give orders for its use.

   When you are satisfied with your ship's orders, press X for E(X)it.
   If you have more than one ship, you will be asked to give them their orders.
Enter their orders in the same way.
   When you have given all of your ships their orders, press /.  Until you
press /, you may still return to any of your ships and enter new orders.  Once you have pressed /, however, your portion of the turn is over.
   The screen will now read:
IT IS PLAYER 2's TURN.  PLAYER 1 TURN AWAY.
   If you have a human opponent, he will now give orders to his ship or ships.
If you are playing solitaire, you will proceed directly to the Execution Phase.
   When player 2 has given his orders, the Orders Phase is over.  The Execution
Phase is about to begin.

   During each Orders Phase from turn ten on, you have one further option: to
save your ship by escaping the battlefield.  In some scenarios, saving your
ship will win you victory points; in others, while you might lose the scenario,
it may help to win the war, if your ships are needed in other scenarios in a
strategic game.  Both range and tractors may be important if you choose this
option.
   In order to successfully escape, you must meet these conditions:
+ If the battle is being fought in enemy territory, you must have a range of
at least 2 to escape.  If it is being fought in contested territory, you need a
range of 1 or more.  Ships with a range of 0 cannot escape at all, unless towed
away by a ship with a tractor beam.
+ If your ship has sufficient range and a tractor beam, it can escape with one
additional ship, even with a range of 0, in tow.  If you have two tractors, you
can save two ships.
+ No ship can escape during the first ten phases of combat.
   To escape, press *.  All your ships that have the ability to escape will
flee the battle zone.

   You are now ready for the Execution Phase.
   The computer will ask:
WHAT SHIP IS THE ORIGIN?
   You may not  select which ship will be in the center of the screen.  Enter
the initial letter of that ship.
   The computer will ask:
WHAT SCALE? (0-5)
   You may watch the battle on a large-scale map (Scale 5) or a smaller scale
map.  Enter the number of the scale you wish.
   You will now watch all ships simultaneously performing the maneuvers and
firing the weapons indicated during the Orders Phase.  The display will show
you not only the ships, but also any guided weapons that are on their way to
their targets.  As each weapon reaches its target, the execution phase will
pause, and the display will tell you whether or not that weapon got through the
defenses, whether it hit its target, and how much damage it caused.
__   _
 /  / /
/. /_/  D A M A G E

   The amount of damage that any weapon causes depends upon the power of the
weapon and the effectiveness of the defense systems.
   There are three types of damage: systems damage, extraordinary damage, and
critical hits.

SYSTEMS DAMAGE
   The damage weapons cause to your ship's systems will depend upon how much
space each system occupies.  For instance, if your ship has a total space of
100 cubic sectors, and you have five drives, taking up twenty cubic sectors,
the chance of a drive being hit is one in five.
                       - The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 28 -

PROTECTED SYSTEMS
   Some systems, either because of their location on the ship, are less likely
to suffer damage from enemy fire.
   These systems, even if they are hit, still have a seventy-five percent
chance of surviving in working order:
Cargo Holds
Tractor Beams
Weapons
Fighter Bays
Drives
   Because of their solid protective shields and few moving parts, warp drives
are particularly hard to damage.  A warp drive, even if hit, still has a ninety
percent chance of still working.

DAMAGE STATUS DISPLAY
   The number after DMGE on the status display tells you what percentage of your ship's total number of cubic sectors  has been damages.  This number is also the chance that your ship will suffer extraordinary damage form the next hit.

DAMAGE TO DRIVES
   If, despite their protection, some of your drives are put out of action,
your ability to turn, speed up or slow down will be severely limited.  If all
your drives are destroyed, your ship will completely lose its ability to
maneuver.  All you can do is either slow down your ship to a stop with the drag
chute effect and wither fight it out or wait for help, or keep going and hope
that you're pointed in the direction of home.

THE EFFECT OF SHIELDS ON DAMAGE
   If a weapon or weapons hits your shield, the total number of damage factors
will be totaled and matched against the strength of your shield.  If it is
less than the strength of the shield, your ship will suffer no damage, and a
number of batteries equal to the damage factors will be drained from that
shield.  (If the weapon is a photon torpedo or seeker, an additional number of
batteries equal to four times the damage factors will also be drained.
   If the damaged is more than the shield strength, the number of damage
factors over the shield strength will be counted as damage to your systems.

THE EFFECT OF ARMOR ON DAMAGE
   When a layer of armor is hit, any further damage will be deflected.  Armor
itself can only destroyed by damage from a plasma torpedo, although this does
not prevent the ship's destruction.

EXTRAORDINARY DAMAGE
   Extraordinary damage is damage which kills members of your crew, your
marines, or any troops traveling aboard, or which destroys your sensors or your
jammers.  The more extraordinary damage your ship suffers, the more likely it
will receive a critical hit.






                       - The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 29 -

CRITICAL HITS
   Critical hits are the most serious type of extraordinary damage, hits which
cause irreparable damage by destroying computers, starting fires or rupturing
airtight compartments.  Like a seagoing ship whose superstructure is untouched,
but which has suffered mortal hits below the waterline, a starship can be
wrecked by critical hits even if its other systems are intact.  Each hit you
receive raises the chance that the next hit will be critical.

CRITICAL HITS DISPLAY
   The number after CRITS on the status display tells you how many critical
hits your ship can survive, a number equal to the mass of your ship.  If the
number falls to zero, your ship will explode.  This is the only way your ship
can be destroyed.

THE END OF THE SCENARIO
   The scenario will end when all the ships have been destroyed or captured
or the victory conditions have been met.

   If you want to stop and save the game, press Y.  The computer will show you
the SSI SAVE ROUTINE menu, which is the same as the SAVE SHIP menu.  Take out
your game disk and put the SSI SAVE GAME DISK into your disk drive, and follow
the steps outlined in SAVING SHIPS.
   To save the game, you will;
   Press (S) for SAVE ITEM ON AN SSI SAVE GAME DISK.

   The game will end automatically if:
   All the ships of one player are destroyed.
   One or both players have escaped the battle space.
   You can also choose to end the game in the middle of a scenario.  When, just
before the Orders Phase, you are asked if you want to save the game, press Y.
The computer will then show you the SAVE GAME menu.  You will have the choice
of ending the game for good, by pressing (E)ND, or of saving the game for
playing later, by pressing (S)AVE ITEM ON SSI GAME DISK (SEE 4.29:SAVING SHIPS)

DECLARING A VICTOR
   Once the game has ended, the computer will decide who won. First it will ask
IS THE SECTOR CONTESTED (C) FRIENDLY TO PLAYER (1) OR FRIENDLY TO PLAYER (2)?






                       - The Cosmic Balance Dox  page 30 -

   The answer depends on the scenario:
SCENARIO ONE: DEEPSPACE ENCOUNTER     Sector friendly to Player 1 (Alliance)
SCENARIO TWO: PLANETARY RAID          Sector friendly to Player 2 (Brotherhood)
SCENARIO THREE: COMMERCE RAIDER       Sector friendly to Player 2 (Brotherhood)
SCENARIO FOUR: INVASION               Sector friendly to Player 2 (Brotherhood)
SCENARIO FIVE: DOGFIGHT               Sector Contested
SCENARIO SIX: SURPRISE ATTACK          Sector Contested
   Based on your answer, the computer will decide if each had enough range left
to get home safely.

VICTORY POINT DISPLAY
   The computer will then tell you who won.
                    SHIP         PLAYER 1 VP     PLAYER 2 VP
                    RELIANT                          125
                    ENTERPRISE       62
                    TOTAL            62              125
   In this example, the Reliant won the game with a total of 125 victory points
to 62.  If that Enterprise had been destroyed, it would not even appear on the
display.

EXAMINING THE SURVIVING SHIPS
   If you wish to examine any of the surviving ships, press any key to
continue, and the computer will print.

EXAMINE WHAT SHIP (/ to end game)?
   Give the name of the ship you want to examine.  If your ship has blown up,
not even the computer can put it back together again for you to examine.  If
you wish to end the turn at this point press /.

   Military starship design during the 24th Century is usually divided into six
periods, which correspond to the six technological levels.

1.  THE PIONEER WARRIORS (2298-2330)
   The ships of the early century were relatively primitive, but rugged and
versatile.  When called upon to fight, these ships launched swarms of guided
seekers and torpedoes in the general direction of the enemy ships and hoped for
the best.  Hundreds of these weapons from this era are still floating through
deep space, still vainly seeking their targets.  When their long-distance
weapons failed, menu starship commanders won reputations by closing on the
enemy and fighting deadly close range phaser battles with their opponents.
   Both Kellius, who became Chief Designer of the alliance, and Yezov, later
chief architect of the Brotherhood, were students at the Academy of Starship
Design and Technology at this time.

2.  THE DISTANT WARS (2330-2341)
   As Alliance ships explored deeper and deeper space, they began to encounter
ships and outposts of the Brotherhood, a league of warlike civilizations eager
to dominate the known universe.  The requirements of battle in remote space led
to the development of longer-range frigates and cruisers, and deadly new
weapons, including a new generation of seekers and torpedoes whose designers
claimed they could find a digital wrist watch in the Milky Way.
   As his graduate project from the Academy, Kellius designed a side-firing
siege phaser cruiser, which was widely derided by starship traditionalists.
The derision stopped when a prototype of his cruiser in its first battle,
destroyed the Brotherhood Dreadnought "Star Lord."

3.  INVASION (2341-2355)
   The Alliance suffered a setback when Yezov, the most promising designer
after Kellius, defected to the Brotherhood, lured by a promise of unlimited
resources and a chance to defeat his bitter rival, Kellius.  Using captured
ships filled with prisoners for realistic battle testing, Yezov developed a new
generation of Super Dreadnoughts.  In 2344, fleets of these huge battleships
broke through the Alliance's ring of fortress stars and began to invade the
Alliance system.

4.  THE DARK YEARS (2355-2380)
   In these years, Alliance fought desperate battles against the Brotherhood
invaders, Kellius and his designers were hard-pressed to design faster ships
and more effective weapons to offset the Brotherhood's huge advantage in
numbers.  Alliance privateers ventured deep into Brotherhood territory to
attack Brotherhood merchant convoys.

5.  THE GREAT WAR (2380-2389)
   Early in 2355, a daring Alliance raid captured intact the new Brotherhood
Cruiser "Liquidator".  Having studied its systems, Kellius was able to design a
new generation of counterships.  The battles that followed between his new
fleets and the Brotherhood invaders were the largest battles ever fought in
space.  Hundreds of derelict ghost ships, victims of these battles are still
drifting lifelessly.

6.  THE COSMIC BALANCE
   An uneasy balance exists between the Brotherhood and the Alliance, as the
invaders have been pushed back to the borderline.  The disciples of Kellius and
the students of Yezov are hard at work, designing new specialty ships; fighter
carriers, plasma torpedo frigates, tractor ships, ECM and ECCCM ships, decoy
ships, and others that will fight the battles of the next century.
   In 2390, on his ninetieth birthday, Kellius addressed the students at the
Academy of Starship Design and Technology.  The five maxims of starship design
he gave the students are still widely quoted:

"Ships are destroyed by the mistakes of their designers, not by the enemy."

"Never economize on the crew space.  If a crewman can't sleep, he can't fight."

"Be sure that your ship can run if it can't fight, and fight if it can't run."

"The best ship is the simplest ship that can accomplish its mission."

"For each perfect ship, there is an equal and opposite countership that will be
 able to destroy it."
