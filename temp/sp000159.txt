Pumpkin Pie

	Crust; 2 cups flour and 2/3 cup margarine. Cut the margarine
into the flour with a knife until it's in pea-sized chunks. Moisten
with water little by little and wad it up then roll it out and put it
in the pan. Do this outdoors in the cold if you want the best result,
then keep the pan in the fridge until you're ready to bake.

	Filling; mix equal parts firm tofu and cooked pumpkin with
about a cup of honey. for my 12" thing I used 28 oz of pumpkin, for
the 9" use 16oz. Mix some ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg in with all
this, also a few spoonfuls of vegetable oil. The tofu is chunky as is
so you'll have to mix the whole lot in a blender to get it smooth
enough. 
	Put the filling in the crust and bake at 400-F for 90 minutes.
Let it cool for a couple hours so it gets nice and firm. 

oh yeah and don't forget to make a little @ out of yer extra dough and
put it in the center of the pie.
