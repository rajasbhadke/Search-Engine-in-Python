Another exciting adventure game brought to your by Team TARDIS. The dox were written (in three parts) in their entirety so you may not misss a single clue. The game is played much better and you'll have more fun with the completed dox, which we here, at Team TARDIS, believe you Cat-Fur folks should have everytime a new ware is posted.

Startup
=======

Boot the program disk.  Read the communication from Starfleet Command
and then press <return> to continue.

The main simulation will then appear.  You are now on the bridge of
the Enterprise. On the screen before you are interactive text windows.
Each window contains an explanation of its purpose.  After you read the
contents of these screens, press <return>.

The mission begins.  You are Captain James T. Kirk, standing on the
main bridge of the starship Enterprise.  Good luck and good hunting!


Verbal Communication
====================
In the Kobayashi Alternative, you'll be evaluated on your ability to
think, act, and communicate as Kirk would.  You communicate with your crew and
other beings through natural language.  This allows you to type commands and
questions just as you would say them if you were speaking.  When you type in
statements, they appear in the window labeled <KIRK>.  Remember- this is your
voice.  Type only those things you want to  ** say **  to another person
(or being.)  After typing a statement, press <return> and the program will
process it.  Movements and actions are accomplished through special keys
explained below.

Below are some samples of statements that the program understands.
This is a partial list, and many other expressions are possible.  When the
program cannot interpret your input, an error message will appear.

But remember, this computer simulation is designed to test your
command ability; it responds most efficiently when you use language that is
common to Starfleet personnel.  Using unusual language will result in less
than optimum completion of the mission and add penalties to your performance
evaluation at the end of the game.

ACTIONS
-------

Actions are controlled with special keys, not with text commands.
Some of the possible actions include:

        Inventory       Examine         Give            Look
        Take            Drop            Use             Utilities
        Shoot

To see an index of actions on the screen, press Shift-1.  When you press an action key, a window opens, listing the options you have for E (orthat
specific action.  To remove the window or abort, press <ESC>.  Remember,
you CANNOT use the interactive text window to perform any of these actions.
However, you can use it to tell other crew members to do things for you.


MOVEMENT
--------
Walking and moving about is controlled by the arrow keys.  You cannot
get from one place to another by giving a verbal command through the text
window.  However, you can tell beings to go from one place to another with
verbal commands.  (Ex: (talking to Spock)  GO TO THE BRIEFING ROOM and you will
see him leave.  Or you can command someone to come to you: (talking to Uhura
thru the intercom while in Sickbay) COME TO SICKBAY and she will come and
visit you.  Gee, just what you needed...)  Use the keys below to move from one
place to another within the Enterprise or on a planet's surface. An arrow in
the lower right of the status window indicates your current direction.

SUBJECT: ADVANCED CADET - EVALUATION MATERIALS


Sir:

You will be pleased to know that Starfleet Command has chosen the Enterprise's 
recovery of the USS Robert A. Heinlein during the second five-year mission as the model for the new cadet-performance evaluation exercise at Starfleet Academy, Earth and SFA, Deneb, supplementing the "Kobayashi Maru" scenario. (SFA, Vulcan is presently evaluating the supplement to see that it meets their logical standards, and Admiral T'Kaien's office assures me of a decision within
several standard weeks.)
  You have not been the only commander to point out the Academy's urgent need for a subtler and more complex evaluation scenario than the one offered by the
"Maru."
  While administering the "no-win" scenario gives us a good preliminary sense of who our potential heroes are, it leaves untested those qualities in a com-
mander that are as important as heroism but less spectacular: namely, observation, accurate evaluation, and multi-level "synthesis" - not to mention sheer endurance, empathy, and humor. The Enterprise's recovery-mission scenario gives us ample opportunity to test for all these, in depth. And since the mission results were (naturally) never declassified, the effectiveness of the material as a means of testing the command aptitude and intelligence of new cadets should be very high indeed.
  I suspect that some of Fleet's eagerness to implement this new scenario has to do with the fact that during the past year three more cadets have broken the old "Kobayashi Maru" scenario - and only one of them used methods similar to yours. (This information is to be treated as confidential until further notice.) Apparently, cadets are getting smarter. Or perhaps the no-win scenario and the equally dangerous elation of the "no-lose" attitude lie mostly in the latter category. We look for good results from the new scenario, for it concerns the real-life, "gray" area between those two attitudes. Administration methods will vary. The test may be conducted via sleep learning or in computer
simulation. SFA, Earth will be administering it aboard the new training ship USS Sans Souci. I am enclosing a copy of the computer version for you to evaluate. Please feel free to make any suggestions you think will improve the usefulness of this scenario as a test for future starship captains.

  Sincerely,

  Admiral G. Thometz, Commandant
  Starfleet Academy, Earth

 (P.S.: Let's see them cheat on this one, huh, Jim? Also, "Eliake sends her 
  regards. Best, Greg)

(CAUTION: Full Vulcan cadets should not take the direct-experiential version of this briefing, due to the presence of species-idiosyncratic emotional reaction)  

The communicator whistles right into your ear. The dream you were having about hiking in the Grand Canyon falls right out of your head as your eyes snap open. You lie there staring at the ceiling for just long enough to let your heart rate slow down a little, then sit up and swing out of bed, hitting the communicator switch.

"Kirk here. This had better be good, Lieutenant."

"It may not be good, sir," says the dry voice of the duty communications officer, "but it is important. Eyes-only dispatch from Starfleet."

You groan softly to yourself and sit up a little straighter, just enough so that you can reach the keyboard by the bed and type in the long string of characters that will give the comm officer access to your command ciphers.

"Have the computer send it down here."

"Aye, aye, sir."

You wait a few seconds. The communications officer wakes up your desk screen by remote, then switches off.

"Voiceprint," says the desk computer.

You say your name.

"Retinal," says the computer.

You hold still and let the low-power laser flicker in your eye. Without further
ceremony the desk screen fills up with print, amber on black.

TEXT: USS HEINLEIN, ON EXPLORATORY MISSION IN 145 TRIANGULI AREA, HAS FALLEN OUT OF COMMUNICATION UNDER WHAT WE CONSIDER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. ROUTINE HOURLY TELEMETRY SQUIRTS CEASED WITHOUT EXPLANATION 12 HOURS AGO. APPENDED TO THESE ORDERS IS THE CONTENTS OF A SINGLE UNSCHEDULED SQUIRT THAT CAME TO US VIA AN UNUSUAL ROUTING - DUMPED TO A ROBOT COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE NEAR GAMMA TRIANGULI, APPARENTLY BY HIGH-POWERED COMMUNICATIONS TACHYON PACKET BEAM. YOU ARE TO EVALUATE THE CONTENTS OF THE TELEMETRY SQUIRT AND PROCEED IMMEDIATELY AT
MAXIMUM WARP TO THE HEINLEIN'S LAST KNOWN POSITION, WHICH IS INDICATED IN THE 
SQUIRT.

WARNING: HEINLEIN WAS PURSUING A MISSION, THE OBJECTIVES OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN DECLASSIFIED FOR ANY PERSONNEL EXCEPT THOSE OF SFC, EARTH FLEET ADMIRAL'S OFFICE. THIS MISSION MATERIAL WILL BE AVAILABLE TO YOU AS SOON AS DECLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES ARE COMPLETE.

ADDRESS ANY INQUIRIES TO : SFC, EARTH.

================================================================================ 
You sag a little where you sit, letting out a worried sigh as the screen scrolls down and adds:

================================================================================ 
P.S. : JIM - STAY OUT OF TROUBLE. YOU'RE GOING TO BE A LONG WAY FROM HELP.
       BEST, NHAURIS

================================================================================    
  
"Stop," you say to the screen as you get up and out and head for the closet to
get into uniform. Damn, you think. Sulu has the Heinlein. What's he gotten him-
self into now? Brand-new ship. And you were the one who recommended him for 
this temporary command assignment. When no one of command rank with sufficient knowledge of the Trianguli sector was available, he was the perfect choice. You thought he'd just ride around for a few weeks, enjoy the scenery, and not get himself right into trouble.

You pull the uniform top over your head and sit down at the desk.
"Go," you say to the computer.

"Appended," it says. "Visual and audio content."

"Ready. Go."

The text vanishes. Part of the screen begins reading out print telemetry, the ongoing status of a starship's main function boards. The rest of it fills with an image of the ships bridge. The Heinlein is one of the newer lightcruisers and, though the bridge is a touch smaller than the Enterprise's, it's sleeker, neater. Banks of switches have been replaced by light-controlled relays or motion sensors; screens are bigger and clearer: the fore screen looks more like a picture window, one that you could walk right out of and into the stars drifting slowly toward you. You look past the helm, at that screen. Sitting in the center seat is a lithe young form, with his back to you. You know that back
well, having stared at it for so many years when you were sitting where he is now. But he's not so young anymore, and very straight he sits in his own center seat, superbly self-assured. He is staring at the contents of the screen intently.

"Don't lose it, Michael," he says softly. "You lose it, I promise you I'll dock your pay."
                  
The navigator looks over his shoulder for a second. Wearing the slightest grin,
he says, "Sir, this fish is hooked. Eighteen light-years and closing."

"Screens," says Sulu.

"Deployed," says the helmsman, glancing over her board. "At full intensity."

"Phasers --"

"Ready, sir."

"Don't get trigger-happy, Brynne. They're just in case."

"Noted, sir," says the helmsman. But you notice that her fingers are twitching a bit - the way Sulu's used to, once upon a time. Despite the building tension,
you smile a little.

"Target at sixteen light-years," says the navigator.

"Identification yet?"

"Not close enough, sir."

"I want to know who that is," Sulu says softly, "and what they're doing here so close to what we just passed."

"Target's accelerating, sir! Warp five now - warp six -"

"Oh, no you don't," Sulu says. "Catch him. Maneuvers at your discretion. Mr. Wilhelmsmen, hail him. Ask him politely to stop and be identified."

"Warp seven now, sir," says the navigator, and the ship moans softly in its bones as it leans into higher speed. You lean forward a little with it. Stars stream by the screen faster. And up there in the darkness, just barely visible,
something shines --

"Visual!" says the comm officer. "No response to hails."

"All right," Sulu says, not sounding entirely regretful, "we'll do this the hard way. Rhia, what do its engines' power-consumption curves look like? Can
you get a fix on them?"

-- and your insides jump in terror as the screen whites out, as the ship lurches madly and people caught entirely unaware spill onto the floor, as the Heinlein's automatic red-alert sirens begin wailing like banshees, as the moaning of the ship's engines gets alarmingly loud. Sulu is still in his helm - how, you can't imagine, shouting orders, hearing answers back before he finishes them.

" -- five ships -- six -- eight now --"

" -- fore screens down to forty percent, sir!"

" -- fire at will --"

" -- hull pressure --"

" -- explosive decompression!"

" -- seal down decks five and eight --"

" -- Wil, dump the log three ways, hurry it -- packet the top to the nearest station and load the buoys with the rest -- no, even better, just one buoy --"

"Starfleet Command, Deneb, this is Heinlein --"

" -- twelve of them, sir --"

"What are they? Who are they?!"

" -- can't even --"

" -- hull pressure --"

" -- starboard nacelle --"

And then comes another terrible explosion and crash and flinging of bodies about. Visual goes down, leaving you with a screen two-thirds black, the rest displaying frantic and deranged readouts from science station, helm, navigations: all systems near failure, life support going, matter-antimatter reaction near critical -- and the voices, confused, desperate, brave:

" -- come on, Wil, move it!"

" -- phasers --"

" -- tubes are crushed, no use --"

" -- Starfleet, Deneb, do you read? USS Heinlein --"

And worst of all, Sulu's voice, flavored with something you've never heard in it before -- despair.

"Oh, my god -- "

A scream; then nothing but black noise, the complacent hiss of uninvolved stars. And even the telemetry dies.

"End file," says the screen.

You have to hold still for a few seconds, again, to let your heart slow.

"Bridge," you say then.

"Bridge. Lieutenant Renner."

"Get me Fleet," you say. "And once you've done that, recall the special- 
missions crew. We've got trouble."

"Yes, sir."

Sulu... you think.

"Any other orders, sir?"

You think about that too.

Cadets may wish to review the histories and careers of the principal ENTERPRISE special-missions command crew. Although much of this information is common knowledge among Starfleet personnel, cadets of species in which latency has occurred recently (plus/minus ten standard years) may not be familiar with the qualifications of the command crew of the ENTERPRISE. For their benefit, and to dispel many rumors (justified or not), a brief career summary of each crew member is included.

Some candidates may not have detailed information concerning the theory and operation of Constitution class starships. Since basic knowledge of these ystems is required for participation in this scenario, a brief rundown of equipment strucure an capabilities is included.

ENGINES
-------
Propulsion is by controlled matter-antimatter reaction. Total annihilation of both substances takes place within a magnetic bottle. maximum speed: warp factor 8; cruising speed: warp factor 4; maximum safe cruising speed: warp 6. If warp 6 is maintained for more than twenty-four hours at a time, themagnetic bottle containing the matter-antimatter reaction reordes dangerously and becomes unregenerable because of magnetization of the generating equipment. Damage to dilithium crystals is also likely, especially if the crystals hve seen more than 3000 hours of service. Failuire of dilithium crystals (which help channel power to the warp engines from thematter-antimatter reactors in the nacelles) will force the ship to drop out of warp. The ship may proceed on impulse power until repairs are affected (usually eight hours).

Destruction of all of the ship's dilithium crystals will force the ship to proceed to a planet where they can be obtained through mining or trade. However, just getting to such a planet is likely to take anywhere from several months to several years. Captains who burn out all of their ships' dilithium crystals are rarely entrusted with another starship command.

Matter for the matter-antimatter reaction is usually intersellar hydrogen, NH, or other radicals that are "scooped" out of space by the accretion layer of the ship's warp field. Antimatter is manufactured periodically aboard ship by accepted0laboratory methods (each narcelle has a collapsed-matter-target linear accelerator adapted for use as an antiparticle "breeder"). Fuel is therefore a regenerable resource. However, there are places in space where even monatomic hydrogen is so sparse that the ship will be in danger of runnig out of "steam." Sensors can be used to locate these interstellar doldurms in advance.

Primary life support is powered by the warp engine system. Secondary life support is powered by the impulse engines. Periods longer than thirty days on impulse will exhaust secondary life support, leaving the ship without backup.


PHASERS
-------
Phasers come in two kins: the large "ship's pahser" and the small "handphaser." A "phaser beam" is hypercoherent radiation from anartificially grown cesium-dilithium cyrstal LED that is energized by ganged conventional high-power lasers (descendants of the "satelite killers" of old). The multiple lasers and the crystal are manufacured and tuned to emit a "chord" of frequencies only a few hundre-thousandths of an angstrom apart. The multiple beams exponentially augment one antoher's efficiency and are still more coherent than any conventional laser alone while they remain in phase (thence th name). Pahsers are independently powered out of the ship's secondary energy supply (as opposed to those on thenewly desinged Enterprise, which are powered directly out of the warp engines). When a starship is in warp, thepahser beasm (at firing) share its faster-than-light (FTL) acceleration for a brief period after punching out of the warp field. Therefore, they can be used FTL battle, but over long distances they quickly lose their FTL speed. Phasers canbe burned ot excessive use (bombardmets of more than five minutes iwthout a rest-and recycling period). Their most common malfuntion - also related to overuse (which often occurs after approximately three minutes of constant use) - is failure of one of the ganged lsers. This cases the phaser chord o lose one of its componetns and the rest f he beam to lose mst of its effectiveness. Full power is not always necessary. A captain may call for half- or quarter-power.
Ship's phasers are themost effectiv way to reduce antoher ship's defensive screening. A sequence of three hits (sustained barrages lasting from 3 to 5 seconds each) at full power on another ship's screens will begin overloading those screens and reducing their effectiveness. Subsequent hits knock the target screen down anoher 10 percent to 15 percent for each hit until here is no power left and the target ship's naked hull is exposed.
Enterprise's phaser "banks" are located both fore and aft. The fore bank is located under the main "disk" hull, near the center; the aft banks are aimable within about a 270-degree spherical radius, leaving very few unprotected angles. (But there are a few.)
Handphasers are smaller versions of the large ship's phasers. Settings range from "stun" to "kill". The stun setting will leave the average human being unconscious for anywhere from ten minutes to an hour, depending on the victim's physical condition. A handphaser on the highest setting is capable of heating a ;small boulder red-hot in amtter of seconds or melting thorugh a metal door. handphasers are good for about twenty minutes' continuous use before needing recharge. They are rechargeable wither aboard ship or, inthe filed, by ;use of extra power packs (which contain about fiftenn minutes' power each).
handphasers have the same tnedencies to burn out or lose chord as he big ship's phasers do. They can be set to intentionally overload and explode. Some alien species (for example, Hortas) are not affected by handphaser fire unless special alterations have been made to the weapon. Tkhey have small limited-range warp-field generators that enable them to be used agianst objects traveling faster than the speed of light.


PHOTON TORPEDOES
----------------
A photon torpedo is a simple, elegant, and effective weapon coprised of a very samll amount of antimatter contained in a magnetic bottle and the generating apparatus to maintian the bottle. On command, the bottle degenerates, which brings the antimatter into contact with the generator's matter and procudes a temendous explosion of both standar shock waves and extremely hard radiation. Photon torpedoes can be fired directly at a nearby object to explode on contact with it, or they can be set with delayed fuses and ejected as mines.
Photon torpedo "tubes" must be recharged after each use, both by reloading the tubes with new torpedo apparatus and equipping th etoprs wih fresh antimatter from ship's breeders. The process takes from thirty seconds to aminute after a "full spread" has been fired.
Enterprise is equipped to fire photon torpedoes from both front and rear: each bank is comprised of four aimable tubes; A "full spread" is eight torpedoes, one from each tube: front, back, right front, right rear, left front, left rear, upper center, lower center. Simultaneous fire form all four tubes pointing in agiven direction may be concentrated on one point.


TRACTOR BEAMS
-------------
Tractor beams are actually "grasers": coherent beams of gravitywave packets. Atractor beam locks onto a given object and, by mimicking a radically increased gravitational field, pulls it closer to the ship for examination or other purposes. Pressor beams ust the same technology but with polarities reversed to exert great gravitational pressure on a small area. Conventional tractors and pressors are effective only on masses less than sefveral hundred thousand tons; this makes thier effect on other starships minimal. The net effect of a full force tractor or pressor on a starship is equivalent to a hard shove. Therefore, tractor and pressor beams generally arenot used battle situations.


SCREENS
-------
Defensive screening is one of the largest power drains in a Federation starship and its main protection in battle. (Klingons - being more interested in offensive armament - pay relatively little attention to screening. But the better-engineered and -powered screens of a Federation ship are a match for Klingon phasers.) The screens are a set of classic force fileds, domains of tuned high-state particle/wavicle-packet fluctuations: six sets of field domains, overlapping and reinforcing one another in a manner reminsicent of the tuned reinforcement of phasers (i.e., one screen's destruction weakens all of the others by 10 percent).
Enterprise has six screens - fore,aft,right high, right low, left high, left low - that completely surround th ship when all are running. Power canbe selectively channeled to each of them to reinforce one screen that's being attacked more forcefully thn the others, though this decreases the total power available to the others. Screens are powered out of the warp drive and do not funtions at peak capacity while the ship is in warp andrunning. This tnds to encourage a captain to choose "stand-and-fight" battle situations whenever possible.
Self-destruct can be effected by overloading all of the screens and channeling full power to them. This option is available for last-resort stiutaions but is not considered a viable alternative in most battle scenarios for obvious reasons. Those who bluff self-destructs often find their bluffs called.


SENSORS
-------
Enterprise's main sensor array (sometimes referred to as "scannerss") includes a variety of tachyar-based devices capable of detecting movement or radiation and analyzing the compostion and location of almost every known element. At short range (up to 500 miles), thesensors candetect individual creatures' life signs. At medium range (500 to 50,000 miles) they are better at detecting movement and radiation from the infrared up through visible light, the ultraviolet, and x-rays; and doing compound analysis. Longrange  sensing (50,000 miles to approximately 10 parsecs, or 32 light-years) is confined primarily to very storng and artificial radiation sources (i.e. other ships, which in warp drive tend to leave a readable "ion trail" behind them) and large-scale physcial movement (planetary orbits, stellar motion, etc.) Certain lead-bearing and heavy-metal-bearing compunds (pitchblende, etc.) wil interfere with scanner fuctions. Long-range scanning in particular is easily disrupted by interstellar "jamming" and "bad weather," because of the extreme lenth of the tachyon particle/wave on which it relies.
Pesonal scanners, such as the tricoder, are also more effective close range (1 to 1000 feet) than at long range (5 to 10 miles). Tricoder readings usually have to be supplemented ith on-site investigation: they tned to be vague.


TRANSPORTERS
------------
Close-range transporters move people and objects by analyzing the energy states of their atoms and then creating an equivialent set of states, or Dirac jumps, at another location. (Therefore, one briefly "ceases to exist" while in the transporter, which is hwat always makes Dr. McCoy so nervous about using it.) The transporter's maximum range is 30,000 miles (a littel more than theusual orbiatal altitude of a visiting starship). Because of the extreme proximity of the tolerances to which they must be tuned to ensure that living beings get safely from one location to antoher, transporters are cranky and delicate, and are constantly malfunctioning for one reason or another: dilithium-drystal misalignment; interstellar jamming, or "black noise" that threatens to distort th signal; and o forth. When screens are up, the transporters cannot be used to beam out of the ship. OIveruse (heavy continous transporting for more thn several hours) may cause transporter circuityr to burn out. Intraship beaming is extremely dangerous and is not recommended except in utmost emergencies. The result of beaming rom one location to another within the ship is almost always fatal.


SHUTTLECRAFT
------------
Shuttlecraft are small general-use spaceraft powered by impulse power only. Thye are used: for trips that exceed the trasnporter's effective range, when the transporter is malfunctioning, and for carrying objects wither too large or too delicate to entrust to the transporter. Their power supply is rechargeable from the Enterprise but is still somewhat  limited. Their effectiv range is about 500,000 miles at .10c (Shufftlecraft do not exceed this speed limit for fear of reltivistic effects.) This gives them up to about eight hours at cruise or an hour at top speed.


COMMUNICATIONS
--------------
Subspace "radio" is actually a tachyon-based technology beargin little resemblance to the radio of old. It is not dependent on lightspeed - indeed the slowest it can go is c; its high speed limit is about 136,000 c, or warp 9. But even this great speed becomes insufficient for effective communication as one's distance from Starfleet increases. Out near the Romulan Empire, for example, it takes nearly three weeks for a message to reach Fleet. This leaves starship captian pretty much on his or her own, although regular communication with Starfleet is expected and advised. Subspace radio can be jammed purposely or interfered with by bad interstellar "weather."
Communicators use the same tehnoloy but with a shorter range (about 40,000 miles) and much lower power. Use in atmosphere limits thier range to about 20,000 miles, because of the dissipation of tachyon pulses into Cerenkov radiation on contact with the gas molecules in air.
Ship's intercom system permits audio and visual communication and conference calling to and from any location on the ship. One may also be "patched in" to external communicatio.s, allowing these soame capabilities from virtuallly any location.


COMPUTER
--------
Enterprise's computers are extraordinarily versatile, with a total memory and "effective synapse number" that make some people ownder whether they're slightly sentient. Their exact virtual memoriy size is classified; it is rumored to be in the multiple petabytes (1 PeB equals 1 quadrillion bytes.) Computers can report verbally or visually (hard copy or display) on any phenomenon th ship's sensors can detect and, if requested, will include analysis. The computers also contain a vast data base of general iforamton on ship's function and other subjects.


SICK BAY
--------
Sick bay contains various knids of medical scanning equipment and numerous devices for healing the sick: primarily the "anabolic protoplaser,"which forces tissue regeneration. The more delicate or specialized the tissure (heart, brain, etc.) the longer such regeneration takes. A broken bone can be reknit in about an hour. Damaged brain or neural tissue regenerates in one to two days, but rehabilitaiton or retraining time must be added.

ORNA/IOTA TRIANGULI
-------------------
A striking borderline M-class world of blue sandstone canyons and evaporated salt-pan seas. This is the home of the Ornae, a strange protoplasmic/amoeboid species... never yet contacted by Federatio personnel but rumored by free traders to be the greatest toolmakers in the galaxy. An ornaet will use anything as a tool ...  even itself.

MALAKIYY 12/789 CIRCINI
-----------------------
From the surface of this small, dark, rocky world, far out in its solar system, a radion signal whispers desperately into the endless night, crying out for help ...  and the language it uses is ancient English.

ANDORGHA/KAPPA-1 APODIS
-----------------------
An R-type world with a silvery, murky methane atmosphere and a bad reputation ... no Federation vessel investigating it has ever come back.

HASTORANG/1214 NORMAE
---------------------
A gorgeous M-type planet, almost a twin of Earth - but an Earth stuck fast in the tenth century and populated by alien kings, armored knights, distressed damsels, and wizards ... "white" and otherwise. And what of the dragons?

ACHIR/R OCTANTIS
----------------
An lien species has built a Dyson sphere around this lovely rose-colored sun - a stupendous feat of engineering, now home to billions of people. But the star is dangerously variable and about to flare up. Without the help of a Federation starship, billions could die.

NAIAU/I 139 CIRCINI
-------------------
An Earthlike planet populated by an intelligent feline species in theearly stages of its space program. As yet there has been no official contact with the Federation. However, a delirious free trader picked up in a derelict ship near the system reported seeing the bones of a previous exploratory expedition there. This observation has not been confirmed.

JAUZAH/4403 PAVONIS
-------------------
A small, dry, cold planet, rich in minerals, but barren of cities or other artifacts. Sensors insist that life has evolved here ... but it has not yet been found. Starfleet cannot tell if this is a trap, a snesor malfuntion, or a misunderstanding.

KLUSOS/515 ARAE
---------------About asnon-Earthlike as a planet can get - a world of corrosive soil and an atmosphere full of hydrochloric acid. Why this world's sleek, glassy starships attack everyone who passes by remains a mystery ... as does what can be done to stop them.

TSHIO/803 MUSCAE
----------------
A world superficially Earthlike but housing a bizarre culture uprooted from Earth by another sapcefaring species in the dim past.

KHUT/43 PAVONIS
---------------
A hot world of mountainous continets washed by soupy seas of hydrocarbons and liquid plastics. In those seas live the a'Khut, intelligent and reclusive beings who in th past have asked only to be let alone. Recently, however, they have been desperately hailing every ship that passes their planet.

Startup
=======

        Boot the program disk.  Read the communication from Starfleet Command
and then press <return> to continue.
        The main simulation will then appear.  You are now on the bridge of
the Enterprise. On the screen before you are interactive text windows.
Each window contains an explanation of its purpose.  After you read the
contents of these screens, press <return>.
        The mission begins.  You are Captain James T. Kirk, standing on the
main bridge of the starship Enterprise.  Good luck and good hunting!


Verbal Communication
====================

        In the Kobayashi Alternative, you'll be evaluated on your ability to
think, act, and communicate as Kirk would.  You communicate with your crew and
other beings through natural language.  This allows you to type commands and
questions just as you would say them if you were speaking.  When you type in
statements, they appear in the window labeled <KIRK>.  Remember- this is your
voice.  Type only those things you want to  ** say **  to another person
(or being.)  After typing a statement, press <return> and the program will
process it.  Movements and actions are accomplished through special keys
explained in the next section.

        Below are some samples of statements that the program understands.
This is a partial list, and many other expressions are possible.  When the
program cannot interpret your input, an error message will appear.
        But remember, this computer simulation is designed to test your
command ability; it responds most efficiently when you use language that is
common to Starfleet personnel.  Using unusual language will result in less
than optimum completion of the mission and add penalties to your performance
evaluation at the end of the game.

Actions
=======

        Actions are controlled with special keys, not with text commands.
Some of the possible actions include:

        Inventory       Examine         Give            Look
        Take            Drop            Use             Utilities
        Shoot

        To see an index of actions on the screen, press Shift-1.  When you
press an action key, a window opens, listing the options you have for that
specific action.  To remove the window or abort, press <ESC>.  Remember,
you CANNOT use the interactive text window to perform any of these actions.
However, you can use it to tell other crew members to do things for you.


Movement
========

        Walking and moving about is controlled by the arrow keys.  You cannot
get from one place to another by giving a verbal command through the text
window.  However, you can tell beings to go from one place to another with
verbal commands.  (Ex: (talking to Spock)  GO TO THE BRIEFING ROOM and you will
see him leave.  Or you can command someone to come to you: (talking to Uhura
thru the intercom while in Sickbay) COME TO SICKBAY and she will come and
visit you.  Gee, just what you needed...)  Use the keys below to move from one
place to another within the Enterprise or on a planet's surface. An arrow in
the lower right of the status window indicates your current direction.

Move North/enter   Up Arrow             Ctrl-U
Move South/exit   Down Arrow            Ctrl-D


Saving a Game
=============

        To save a game you will need a formatted disk.  First press Shift-0
and then follow the instructions that will appear in the windows.
        To restore a game, press Shift-0 and follow the instructions.


Pausing
=======

        First hit Shift-0, then Shift-2 to temporarily halt a game in progress.


Speed
=====

        The speed control allows you to regulate the rate at which events
happen during the progress of the game.  It can be especially helpful during
battle sequences (hint, hint!)  To set the speed, first hit Shift-0.
Then hit Shift-1 until the desired speed is displayed.


General Notes
=============

        Be careful to make use of all the commands listed here, and not
to forget ** ANY ** of them.  Once I did a scan of the planet and found it to
have vast oceans of seething acid, with some dry ground at a certain location.
I sauntered down to the transporter room, told Scotty to "beam me down,' and
promptly materialized in a pool of benzene, killing my character!  Point made.
        Having the rank of Captain (or Admiral, you want to get technical)
has its advantages.  You can say, "Kirk to Scott."  The intercom will pop on
and he'll talk back to you (or speak directly to you if he's in the same
room) and then you can ask him about the engines and so on.  He'll even do
chores for you, like "bring me the hand phaser."  After issuing the command
wait a bit and he'll come right to you and hand you the phaser!

Here are a few stars/solar systems to visit:

Orna / Iota Trianguli - A planet of master toolmakers and craftsmen.
Malaky 17 / 784 Circini - Uninhabited but a strange report of a plea for help
                          was received from this system- in ancient English!
Khut / 43 Pavonis - Populated by a reclusive people who have suddenly decided
                    to urgently ask for prompt aid.

                     and placed here.
Klusos / 515 Arae - Has a corrosive atmosphere and was thought to be dead until
                    odd glassine ships began attacking any approaching vessel.
Achir / R Octanis - Its people built a Dyson Sphere around their sun (like
                    a Ringworld except all around) but now that sun is about to
                    nova and you must help them somehow.
Hastorang / 1214 Normae - Class M planet whose inhabitants have only now
                          reached medieval technology levels.
Niev / 1139 Circini - Thought to be populated by a race of felines like the
                      Kzinti.  The last expedition here reportedly abandoned
                      their mission after finding the bones of the first one.


Ok, that's it.  Remember, "The more complex the mind, the greater need for the
simplicity of play!"*
