Greetings once again people..

Well, this file is not a rag but a changed opinion on what I have
previously stated about the members of the Digital Gang..

Excluding Tom E. Hawk and The Dragonlord because nothing was said about them..

The Trade Center Boycott text file which I put out included a few people
who I sort of verbally abused but then again I was in a pissed of mood
because of a problem I had with Dave, (Shelock Apple) and I took it out on
Eddie and Dave and the Sheik.. The Sheik, Heh.. Well, I really dont
want to change my opinion on him because I don't like the fact how
he lies to me and alot of other people so I wont..  Sherlock Apple.. Well,
we have been speaking alot lately.. The time of the last text file I put
out in which I really bagged on Dave I was truly pissed off at him for
a misunderstanding between us.. Allthough everyone seems to have
a problem with him and we have had our problems between us I think
that we can work together and we are friends and now have no problems..

Eddie (The Triton),  when we first talked we did not get along at
all. Since then, we have been gradually been building up our friendship. Hmm,
I ragged him or rather his board because everyone has been and I particularly
didnt care or like the way he has been running his board.. I am talking about
the recent problem with Ogre, where he and others in DG were ragging on
the crack done by The Talisman (Of First Class) and saying it wasnt a
complete version and other things of the sort..  Then what finally
got me upset was something that was told to me by Piece of Eight..
This is a about a ware called The Neverending Sotry.. The problem with
this was that The Sheik was having problems cracking it so The Sheik
called up The Talisman to help him crack it..  So in event he cracked
with the sheik on this ware.. I was told that Eddie made the page by
Piece of Eight and that he was told to give cracking credit to Talisman
from Piece of eight in which Eddie didnt listen..  So I jumped in
to this which I had no business being involved in since it was between
Rob and Chris and I was pissed at Eddie for that and Chris so I ragged
those guys..

Now I see what I have done wrong..

  So there is an apology to you guys..

The Digital Gang is pretty much lame... They got their wares from The Dragon
Lady who works at a computer store or they go out and buy it.  They go out of
their way just to beat out others at releasing a ware, like tying up board
lines and lying!  More recently, the Apploutionist (or whatever) has released
a DG ware. Ha! What a fuck-head.  The DG is dead, but should be remembered.
The Appleoutionist is a fat, scrunched, little shit who sits behind his
computer all day pretending to be elite.  What the fuck is elite anyway?
The Dragon Lord was the biggest fag around, acting childish, and couldn't
even crack a standard DOS 3.3 disk!

Tom E. Hawk was the only one who could ever crack, and he was a hell of a
programmer.  He keeps a very low profile, and Dragon Lord uses him for it!
By the way, Tom E. Hawk Boot is just the Electronic Arts boot altered and
encoded a little...
