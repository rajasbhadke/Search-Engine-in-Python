Counter Information No. 40 - Part 3
===================================

50 Years of Slaughter for PROFIT

The obnoxious D-Day commemorations,  happening only 3 
days before the Euro-Voters'  Big Day on 9th June, are 
emphasising British uniqueness in the European partnership, 
and all that rubbish.
But even if Vera Lynn's disgusting crocodile tears start to 
flow once again, knowledge of the past remains important. 
We should remember how the British authorities had forewarning
of the blitz of Coventry but allowed it to happen. Remember 
the blood baths when Allied aircraft bombed Devon, with 
heavy loss of life, in practice runs for Normandy -- and 
the slaughter once British and American forces arrived on 
the coast of France. Remember the German Jews who were locked 
up by the British authorities. Remember how strikers in northern 
Italy were bombed by both sides, and how millions were shipped 
from German camps straight into Soviet ones. Remember the 
hypocrisy of the statesmen who portrayed the German concentration 
camps as justification of their own rule and then went on to set 
up their own camps in Kenya and Algeria. In short, remember 
that the ruling scumbags in one place always have more in 
common with ruling scumbags elsewhere than they do with 
the poor. War is always brilliant for business.

RESISTANCE - LEST WE FORGET

But above all remember the resistance to the various oppressions. 
In Britain, for example, many men managed to avoid military 
service, and many women avoided being forced into war work as 
cheap labour. Women at Rolls Royce and elsewhere on Clydeside 
struck for equal pay, often supported by men. In Glasgow 
engineering apprentices and bus conductresses also struck. 
When bakers in Dundee refused to work night shifts, their 
work was taken over by soldiers, who were obviously subject 
to a much stricter regime. Astrike by trolleybus workers 
in Stamford Hill in London was similarly broken by the military. 
Strikes occurred in mining, engineering, and the docks. Air 
raids were commonly used as an excuse for absenteeism: some 
people were willing to stay at their workplaces if sirens 
went off during tea-breaks, but not if they sounded during 
worktime.
Remember too, that this was a time when strikes were not 
only opposed in every instance by the unions -- but since 
July 1940 they were also illegal. In 1941, when miners at 
Betteshanger in Kent struck anyway, 1000 of them were 
fined, and three jailed. An all-out strike forced their 
release, and only 9 miners paid their fines. After this, 
the strike ban, technically in force until 1951, was a 
dead letter, smashed by wildcat action. In 1944, the year 
of D-Day, 716 000 workers were on strike,  more than any year 
since 1926.
     The national unity which the authorities are trying to 
whip up with D-Day 'celebrations' wasn't totally successful 
even then. So don't be conned. It's always been the rich 
against the poor. It was us they slaughtered in Iraq, us 
they're killing in Bosnia, us they killed in all the wars 
since 1945 'east of Suez' and in Africa. World War 2 was 
no different. Our rulers are mass-murdering monsters, and 
nations are just vile myths they use to oppress us.
REMEMBER 1944 -- GO ON STRIKE!!

VAT - Don't pay it!

THE GOVERNMENT added 8% Value Added Tax to fuel bills from 
1 April - signing the death warrants of the extra 10,000 
people who will die every year from the cold, because of 
the higher bills.
   But - there is resistance.  Pit camp supporters 
repossessed coal from Parkside Colliery, Merseyside 
on 1 April in a direct action against both VAT on 
Fuel and mine closures.  
   Next day 50 people from Lothian Communities Against 
VAT on Fuel occupied British Gas showrooms and picketed 
Scottish Power in central Edinburgh.  Hornsey and Wood 
Green Solidarity Group have picketed the Wood Green gas 
showrooms 3 times.  In Glasgow hundreds of demonstrators 
invaded the St.Enoch shopping centre after the anti VAT 
demo on 26 March.
   "The best way to defeat VAT on Fuel is to do it the 
poll tax way - to cause a huge amount of disruption by 
refusing to pay the VAT portion of our fuel bills," 
urges a Stockbridge New Town Solidarity Network leaflet.
   "(1) When you get your first blue electricity or gas bill - ignore it.  
(2) When you get the red reminder - only pay the main part of the bill.  
Don't pay the VAT part.  
(3) Don't let the meter reader in....  
(4) If threatened....ring your local group."
   Resistance so far is patchy.  Community self-organisation
needs to spread UK-wide.

Edinburgh rocked

Edinburgh.  Athens of the North, Festival City, Europe's third 
finance capital.  "Auld Reekie", where tourists swarm and the 
hoteliers and restauranters wax rich.
   Edinburgh.  Magnet for yuppies and financiers, with the 
working class being increasingly marginalised and ghettoised 
into bleak peripheral housing estates where poverty is the 
name of the game.  
   In the large Craigmillar estate on 13/14 May alienated 
youths rioted and attacked police.  A car was torched, 
and 6 pigs injured.  The media responded with shock and 
indignation, and the local Labour councillor, Paul 
"the Godfather" Nolan called an emergency council 
meeting.
  Youngsters involved told the local press that they were consistently 
harassed and assaulted by the police.  "There's nothing to do and 
nowhere to go.  We've had enough", declared one.  "You can't even
get a job in Craigmillar unless you're related to Paul Nolan" 
said another local.  Councillor Nolan is one of those who are 
trying so hard to shut down the Edinburgh Unemployed Workers 
Centre.


Spain: General Strike

The Spanish general strike on 27th January, in response to 
the Socialist Government's labour reforms, brought major 
cities to a standstill.  Hundreds of thousands joined 
pickets and demos, often clashing with police.  In Granad, 
400 pickets were attacked with rubber bullets and gas, 
injuring 9, and 40 people were arrested in Barcelona 
following running battles.

As well as massive demos in Madrid and Barcelona, there 
were large ones all over Spain: 40,000 in Seville; 25,000 
in Gijon; 90,000 in Oviedo; 20,000 in Cordoba.  There were numerous 
reports of people breaking away from the Socialist (UGT) and 
Communist (CCOO) unions' official demos in favour of direct 
action tactics.

The reforms constitute massive attacks on workers' rights, 
allowing companies to replace people on permanent contracts 
with a cheap and temporary workforce.  The new apprenticeship 
contract for under-25s runs for up to 3 years, with pay at 
55% to 75% of the minimum and no unemployment benefit rights  
at the end.  Part-time workers will lose protection when sick, 
unemployment benefit and pension rights.  With 3.5 million
unemployed and 1 million families without a wage, the reforms 
will force people into low-paid jobs with almost no protection.

beast beseiges cowering councillors

The drumming built to a crescendo, his dancing grew ever 
more frenzied, then suddenly the grotesquely-garbed Beast 
of Broughton flew across edinbrugh's historic Parliament 
Square and hurled himself bodily at the doors of Lothian 
regional Council Chambers.
   Councillors peered nervously from windows as  
street theatre performers, speakers and musicians 
all sent out the same message - Edinburgh Unemployed 
Workers Centre must stay open.  The 25 May demo was 
the latest shot in the battle to save Scotland's only 
self-managed community centre.
  As we went to press the Centre was preparing to resist 
a Council eviction notice due to take effect on 14 June. 
Last minute negotiations, which aimed at a new lease being 
granted to first the local Community Council and then to 
a new charitable body, were still proceeding  The Centre 
voluntary workers are backing the new plan, which if 
agreed should ensure that the Centre's important 
activities continue.
  The Centre provides a cheap vegan cafe, advice and 
solidarity on benefits problems, a communtiy space 
for meetings etc, a base for claimants and others 
to organise resistance against social injustice 
and many other resources.

A FLIGHT OF CONDOMS
Glasgow Women Anarchists and anarcho-feminists from 
Edinburgh caused a stir  at a SPUC meeting at Edinburgh 
University in March when they threw condoms at the 
startled bigots, this followed opposition at a SPUC 
meeting at Glasgow University.

Broken Spectacles

"They're brainwashing us", says a member of UNPLUG, "and we're 
not taking it any more."  Members of UNPLUG have been 
smashing and stealing TVs and videos in their US 
high schools.

The equipment is supplied free by Channel One to 12,000 schools 
in deprived inner-city areas.  The catch?  Schools must sign a 
contract agreeing that the TVs will be switched on to Channel 
One's cable student news service for 90% of the academic day 
and that 90% of the students must watch the "news" each day.

Each 10-minute "news" broadcast has a 2-minute commercial 
break typically advertising Coke, Reebok and Pizz Hut.  
The underground UNPLUG organistaion is rapidly growing 
amongst inner-city school students and calims many direct 
action successes against the force-feeding of corporate
mindrot. 

Remember Winston Silcott

REMEMBER Winston Silcott?  Winston was one of the Tottenham 3, 
brutally framed for the murder of PC Blakelock in the 1985 
Broadwater Farm uprising.  The convictions were quashed after 
an intense mass campaign.
   But Winston remains in prison.  Why?  
   Winston was a vocal black rights activist, a role which 
brought him into open conflict with the racist police who 
repeatedly vowed that they'd "get him".  When he rescued a 
black youth from a beating by a local gang, they also 
vowed to get him. 
   One of the gang, Tony Smith, attacked Winston in a club, 
and was killed with his own knife.  It was obviously self-defence 
and the pigs were furious that the murder charge would not stick.  
So they stitched Winston up for the PC Blakelock murder.  While 
doing time for the Blakelock killing, and labelled an "evil murderer" 
by the press, Winston was tried for the Smith affair, 
and found guilty.
   He is now desperately trying to have that conviction overturned.  
Remember Winston Silcott.

Tearing down the walls

LAST issue we reported how Gary Hayes, after years of police 
persecution, retaliated by taking an armoured personnel 
carrier and using it to smash into the local police HQ 
and law courts.
   Gary has since been sentenced to four and a half years.  
Like Winston Silcott, another activist has been taken off 
the streets.
