This is our first edition of a new quarterly anarchist paper.  So
why bother? Surely the Revolution is just a dream, a 19th century
utopian myth? How can we have a society without laws  and  rules?
It  would  just  be  chaos, a social jungle from which the strong
would once more emerge to lord it over the weak.

Like many words anarchism has many  meanings  to  many  different
people,  in  a  similar way to words such as socialism, democracy
and freedom. To those people who identify with the word  and  the
tradition  it represents, it does not mean no rules but no rulers
or bosses. Anarchism has always been more concerned with  justice
than  the  letter  of  the law, but anyone who gets involved with
anarchist groups will soon find out that it  is  not  a  case  of
anything goes, even if the rules are not always clearly stated.

The bottom line is treating people as equals, and in the  way  we
would like to be treated ourselves.

While there is one part of the anarchist  tradition  which  seeks
freedom  from  authority  through an individual solution, this is
not what most committed  anarchists  would  regard  as  "serious"
anarchism.  The  main tradition is one of collective organisation
and struggle against the state and the bosses.

That is what this paper is about, our  struggle  together  to  be
free and equal.

It is intended to be a forum for debate at all levels,  from  the
nitty   gritty  of  particular  campaigns  to  broad  theoretical
articles about the meaning of life, the universe and everything.

So if you,ve got something to say about a particular struggle  or
the  whole  goddam  mess  the world's in and what it means, write
