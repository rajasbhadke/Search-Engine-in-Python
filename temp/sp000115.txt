The Authority of Government

by William Godwin

from 'An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice", 1793

Authority in the last of the three senses alluded to is where a man,
in issuing his precept, does not deliver that which may be neglected
with impunity; but his requisition is attended with a sanction, and
the violation of it will be followed with a penalty.  This is the species
of authority which properly connects itself with the idea of government.
It is a violation of political justice to confound the authority which
depends upon force, with the authority which aruses from reverence and
esteem;  the modification of my conduct which might be due in the case if
wild beast, with the modification which is due to superior wisdom.  These
kinds of authority may happen to vest in the same person; but they
are altogether distinct and independent.

To a government, therefore, that talked to us of deference to political
authority, and honour to be rendered to our superiors, our answer should
be: "It is yours to shackle the body, and restrain our external actions;
that is a restraint we understand.  Announce your penalties, and we will
make our election of submission or suffering.  But do not seek to enslave
our minds.  Exhibit your force in its plainest form, for that is your
province; but seek not to inveigle and mislead us.  Obedience and external
submission is all you are entitled to claim; you can have no right to
extort our deference, and command us not to see, and disapprove of, your
errors."
