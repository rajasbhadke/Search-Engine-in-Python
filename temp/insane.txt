
It has returned. Those dissatisfied with the vagaries of conventional
networks -- the politics, gateways to and from the nether regions, and
sheer choice of numbers -- are instigated into becoming one with what
has been described in contemporary fiction as The Mind; The Force;
That Vision Thing; and much much more!

It, in case you are wondering, is a benevelont dictatorship, an

Born and borne in the mind of its Creator, INSANEt is designed with
your mind in mind; the type of mentality that would run out on a fine
Sunday morning upon being awakened by crazed incosiderate kids in the
swimming pool outside of one's townhouse and eat breakfast, taking
one's as-yet-unawake wife along for a 3am munch at the nearest
all-night dive.

Previous incarnations of INSANEt have been castigated by popular
science fiction writers; investigated by Secret Authorities From
Beyond for compliance with mystic codings; and have met with horrors
too monstrous to mention.

Remember, if you don't tie in now, you're one of Them and may be
accosted at any time by the dreaded Men in Chartreuse. And a note
to fashion mavens -- gender stereotypes are awry due to the
requested but not required use of handles or aliases in the Chat
Zone that is INSANEt v4.0.
