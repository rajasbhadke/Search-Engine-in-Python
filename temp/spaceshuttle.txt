
SPACE SHUTTLE (Flight Simulation)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, KB input, joystick optional


     Designed around NASA simulators, "Space Shuttle" aims to put you at the helm of the world's most advanced spacecraft. Your mission: achieve orbit, chase down and dock with a satellite, and return safely to earth.

     Boasting smooth graphics, decent sound effects, and one of the best, most active status/control consoles ever, this simulation quickly envelopes you in the reality of a shuttle mission. You command a big, powerful, complex machine capable plucking satellites like daisies or grinding you to pulp. Not for seat-of-the-pants stick jockies, pre-launch study of the comprehensive flight manual is a must. 

    "Space Shuttle" has to rank among the most absorbing of Apple simulations. Once the pad restraining bolts blow, speed, fuel, three-axis positioning, target distance, and elapsed time all demand constant monitoring and a deft feel for the controls. From bone rattling blastoff to blazing reentry it's sure-fire fun for sim addicts and would be space pilots alike.
