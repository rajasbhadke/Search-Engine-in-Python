 What fun it is to freeze your feet off in the deep snow, for no apparent 
reason. Except the Minnehaha parking lot skitching, and bothering the fuckin' 
fuckers, was enjoyable. Did you know that Dr. Boogie's car (The BoogerMobile.


How cute.) can't hold more than a 1/2 tank of gas? The gas tank has a leak.

engine in that long tunnel on 94, by Lyndale ave. H0000ie! And did Sinbad

manuvers, and Mini gets us to leave literally 15 seconds before the Richfield

  Then, we cruise over to the FD Luditor  ium and outwit the security to take
up some awesome serious-lash Ludes. Well, we knew what we had to do to make it
perfect, so we were off to the VA!

  At the VA, we have to outwit vicious families waiting in the lobby to get

  Hmmm... this is too hard to believe... my alternator belt broke today while 
I was trying to get home from school (which started two hours late). Had to 
call the guy from Triple A to come jump-start the car, and then right after he 
was out of sight, the car stopped again... What's causing all this trouble 
with alternator belts??? I have some theorys...

  1) The Ruskies have a new virus that eats though the alternator belts on cars
     in America, and they're testing it out in Minnesota.
  2) Same as #1, but substitute Army for Ruskies and Russia for America.
  3) There are little gremlins in the cars that are wreaking havoc... 
  4> Ma Bell is using black magic to try and keep us from our computers...
  5) I'm just paranoid.
  6) It's all just a coincidence.
  7) The cars are all trying to commit suicide.
  8) There's a cursed bunch of alternator belts floating around...
  9> etc, etc...
  Hmmm... makes you wonder...

You think thats bad?... Huh!

  I was driving along in Code1 when all of a sudden I shoot 3 pistons through 
the hood. Well, OK, I'm cool, but THEN as I was walking to the nearest 10K 
auto parts, my car gets hit by a truck carrying snow out of the city and gets 
buryed in 3 tons of the stuff.

  Well, I'm still pharmecutically mellow so I go back and take a look and 
wouldn't ya know it, the car gets hit by a piece of a generator from Skylab. 
Well, geez.  I think, this is getting pretty bad, so I try to start the car.

  I barely escaped with my life! Right then, the car gets hit by a whole 
freight train carrying radioactive cow sh*t from 3-mile island. 3000 tons of 
the glowing dung, all over the car... Well, Gross me 0000ut!... that's just 
too crude for ME!...

  But anyway, my alternator still works in it's glowing condition... Anyone 
interested?

   Well the Tribal Ludatorium may be fixed to be completely ludable! If you
recall a double lude lash was preformed at this ludatorium and thus the 
ludatorium was bannished... well there is hope! They may put up a whole new 
pole! That is the rumor heard from an inside source. .(Notyet- he helped with
station five if you recall.)

 (or whoever runs this thing...) Can luding be done by people who don't use 
modems? Even those who don't have computers? I'm just wondering...
