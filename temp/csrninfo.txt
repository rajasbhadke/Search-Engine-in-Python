        THE COLLOSUS SOO RESOURCE NET (CSRNET)-INTERNET/USENET GATEWAY
                             11:11/0 aka 1:222/21



Forward:
========

           The purpose of CSRNet is to provide an Internet/UseNet Gateway.
      When looking for another Net to add to my BBS, I did extensive re-
      search into what GOOD Nets were available other then FidoNet. It
      quickly became apparent that FidoNet was NOT the top Net around. I
      found out that INTERNET was a MASSIVE Network that linked Major
      Universities, Colleges, Businesses, Government Agencies and Users
      around the world. Unfortunately, it also quickly became apparent
      that this was a VERY EXPENSIVE and COMPLICATED Network to get linked
      into.


CSRNet:
=======

           Finally, after connecting up with a DIRECT feed into InterNet,
      I was able to provide to my Users, and Local SysOps, UseNet Confer-
      ences as well as the InterNet Private E-Mail Conference. I then
      decided that there must be other SysOps out there that are going
      through what I had already been through.

           And VOILA! CSRNet! Access to InterNet/USENET Conferences as well
      the InterNet Private E-Mail Conference at an affordable cost. Actually,
      access to 4500+ UseNet Conferences, with over 60 being currently carried.


Policy:
=======

           Very simple, fill out the application, pay your fee, don't
      cause any flack and get permission to feed systems downstream. That's
      it! If I feel that something/someone is causing a problem, I will
      personally get it straightened out. Any unauthorized downstream
      feeds, will result in the system providing the feed to loose their
      CSRNet access!

           Once a reliable feed with HIGH mail volume is established in a 
      given Region, ie, State, I will give them permission to feed other
      Long Distance systems in that Region. Any HOST may, and is highly
      encouraged to do so, feed other systems local to them.


Fees:
=====

           $10/month for access to ANY/ALL of the conferences CSRNet is
       currently carrying, or a flat rate of $100/year.
           
           For conferences that we have access to, but are not currently
       being carried directly by CSRNet, we will require $5/month for
       each set of 3 conferences that must be turned on. This additional
       fee will be required for a 3 month period, and at the end of that
       period, a decision will be made as to whether or not these NEW
       conferences will become part of the main conference selection,
       which would result in the fee no longer being required. My inten-
       tions are to cover my connection fee as well as my long distance
       charges to bring the conferences in. Depending on the success of
       CSRNet, there is a good chance that these fee's will be lowered!

           So as to not cause ANY confusion, all systems getting a di-
       rect feed from CSRN, will be required to pay there own long dis-
       tance charges and it is expected that they will try and pass this
       service on to their local systems and share the cost of their 
       long distance charges.
       
       
Payment & Feed:
===============

           Access will be given immediately following the Nodelist up-
        date. A feed will be provided for a grace period of 2 Weeks.
        If payment has not been recieved within the 2 weeks, the feed 
        will be discontinued until it is. If within 4 weeks, barring
        extenuating circumstances, the fee still hasn't been recieved,
        the feed will be terminated, the system will be removed from
        the nodelist, and a feed will not be given until payment is
        recieved in advance!
