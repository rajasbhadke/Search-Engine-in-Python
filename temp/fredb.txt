 File = refers to the document, report or letter written with
    FrEd
 
 Saving = refers to putting the file on the disk. Saved files
    can later be retrieved for revision or printing.
 
 Loading =  refers to retrieving a saved file from the disk.
    FrEd puts the retrieved file in his memory, at which time
    you can view, edit, revise, or print the document.
 
 Default =   refers to what the program will automatically select
    unless you tell it to select something else.
 
 Delimiter=  refers to the markers surrounding a word or phrase
    used to set off a portion of text you wish to <S>ave,
    <L>oad, <F>ind, or <F>ind and replace.  See DOC.B-4 and
    DOC.C-9 for legal delimiters.

 SAVING A FILE
 Once you have written a document, it is very important to save that file to the
 
 This is the procedure for saving a newly created file:
 1.  Type the <S>ave command
 2.  At the <S>ave prompt at the bottom of the screen, type the
     name of the file.
 3.  Press RETURN.
 
 ADDITIONAL NOTES ON SAVING
 
 (A) -- If you have already given the file a name (which will happen if you have
 
 1. Use the right arrow key to scan over the name of the file.
   Press RETURN.  You will be asked if you want to delete
   the previous version of the file.  If you press Y or Yes and
   RETURN, the old version of that file will be deleted and only
   the new version will be saved on the disk. If you decide that
   you want to keep both the old and the new version you would
   press N or No and RETURN;  Then repeat the process and type a
   new name.
 
 2. Simply type the = sign over the first character of the file
   name. This saves a few keystrokes.  However, you don't get a
   second chance to avoid clobbering the old version. This method
   overwrites the old file automatically, so be careful with this
   one.
 
 (B) -- If you want to save the same file by a different name, type over the exis
 
 (C) -- You can look at the disk catalog by typing a question mark at the <S>ave

 (D) -- NOTE:  FrEd files can only be saved on ProDOS formatted disks. See DOC.A
 
 (E) -- RULES FOR FILE NAMES
 o  File names may not be longer than 15 characters
 o  The filename MUST BEGIN WITH A LETTER.
 o  A filename may contain ONLY LETTERS, NUMBERS, and PERIODS.

    A SPACE.

 MERGING TWO FILES                           SECOND LEVEL FEATURES
 LOADING A PORTION OF A FILE
 COPYING AN ENTIRE FILE IN MEMORY
 COPYING A SECTION OF A FILE IN MEMORY
 
 
 MERGING TWO FILES
 Merging involves joining two documents together into one file.
 
 1. <L>oad one of the files.
 
 2. Move the cursor to where you would like the second file to
    appear.
 
 3. <L>oad the second file.  You will see the prompt,  "Are you
    sure you want to merge?"  Respond Y.
 
 4. The second file will appear inside the first file.
 
 5. <S>ave the file by either a new name or by one of the old
    names.  (Using an old name will delete the old version of
    the file.)
 
 
 LOADING A PORTION OF A FILE
 You can load a part of a file from the disk.  This can be helpful if you want to
 
 1. Place the cursor where you want the file section to
    appear.
 
 2. Type the <L>oad command.
 
 3. At the <L>oad prompt at the bottom of the screen, type:
         FILENAME!Part 1!Part 2!
    where 'FILENAME' is the name of your file, 'Part 1' is
    the name of the first 3-4 words to be extracted, and
    'Part 2' is the last 3-4 words to be extracted.  You
    must type the exclamation marks.  They are called
    "delimiters" and are frequently used by FrEdWriter.
 ..page
 COPYING AN ENTIRE FILE IN MEMORY
 There will be times when you want to duplicate your entire document without havi
 
 This is the procedure:
 1. Move the cursor to the <E>nd of the document.
 2. Type the <L>oad command.
 3. At the <L>oad prompt at the bottom of the screen,  type the
    '#' symbol and press RETURN.  This symbol is used whenever
    you wish to copy something in memory.  Although you use the
    <L>oad command, nothing is loaded from the disk.  Typing just
    the '#' duplicates the entire file in memory.
 
 COPYING PORTIONS OF A FILE IN MEMORY
 1. Move the cursor to the space on the line directly in front of
    the paragraph or block of text you wish to copy.
 2. Enter a symbol you will remember.  (For example %%)
 3. Move the cursor to the space directly after the block to be
    copied.
 4. Enter the marker symbol (%%) again.
 5. Move the cursor to the place where you would like the second
    copy of the form to appear.
 6. Type the <L>oad command. At the <L>oad prompt at the bottom
    of the screen, type
            #!%%!%%!
    and press RETURN.  The marked portion of your file will be
    copied where you had placed your cursor.  The cursor will now
    be blinking at the end of the copy.
 
 An alternate technique could be used:   Type  #!Part 1!Part 2!; refer to DOC.B-4

 EXTRA INFORMATION ON COPYING
 
 (A) -- The markers at the beginning and the end may be different, if you want to
 
 (B) -- If you do not want the markers to be copied, enter N after the last delim
 
 (C) -- If you want to copy a series of portions of a file you may do that at one
 
 (D) -- You may use the N and the A together.
 For example, <L>oad: #!%%!##!NA
 
 (E) -- You may use existing words from the file as the markers. For example, for
   <L>oad: #!(E) -- You may!entire paragraph:!
 duplicates this entire paragraph.
