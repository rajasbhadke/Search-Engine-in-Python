    "vitally important, interesting and informed".

    "If you care about an anarchist approach to health care you owe it to
     yourself to get this pamphlet."

            -Michael Ziesing,  Instead of a Magazine"

    "it helps to set the record straight on this issue, allowing the
     individual to make informed decisions."

            -Ron Tobin, The Thought

    "as a true libertarian, Peacott takes a more radical step by advocating
     the elimination of the prescription system"

            -Richard Kostelanetz, Liberty

    "A solid work with lots of references and a refreshing viewpoint."

            -Mike Gunderloy, Factsheet Five

    "Peacott's pamphlet is "just terrible." It is out-moded, knee-jerk,
     doctrinaire, individualist anarchist claptrap.

            -Michael Bacon, in a letter to Fifth Estate

    "Joe and the other members of the [BAD] Brigade are to be congratulated
     for sticking their necks out here, knowing full well they'll be
     hacked at.  This pamphlet "attacks the notion that freedom-oriented
     feminists or gays should organize separatist groups or communities."

    "[I]f this pamphlet generates debate, they'll be well served by
     it."

            -Mike Gunderloy, Factsheet Five

    "confronts a controversial issue head on," is designed to make people
     aware of what is happening, challenge them to think and act." I give
     it a Highly Recommended to anyone concerned about the plague of
     separatism, which is hopefully all of us."

    "Peacott tackles the idea of individualism by targeting the anarchist
     movement as one of the groups guilty of an anti-individualism bias.

    "In this important and vital pamphlet, Peacott shows how individualism
     is even lacking in the social arrangements and political outlooks of
     the radically progressive thinkers; the people who you would most
     expect to be espousing the rights of the individual."

            -Mark Hand, Incite Information

    "Joe makes an interesting and well written case for individualist
     anarchy (without sectarian dogmatism)."

    "Jerry Kaplan adds a very comprehensive bibliography of books, and
     articles written by and about individualist anarchists.

            -Michael Ziesing,  Instead of a Magazine

    "One of the best statements I've found of an anarchism paralleling my
     own."

            - Mike Gunderloy, Factsheet Five

   "[Y]our brand of individualism is something no egalitarian minded left
    radical could take as anything but the preaching of a thoroughly
    indoctrinated lackey of capitalist hegemony."

    "[W]ith your bizarre and frightening collection of ideas you are a
     perfect tool for the fascist regime as an infiltrator of the true
     radical left."
