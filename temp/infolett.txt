The following is a letter from NRA First Vice-President Charlton
Heston to NRA Board Member Colonel Bob Brown.

================================================================

                           May 12, 1997

Dear Colonel Brown,

Thank you for asking me for a clarification of my comments in an
interview on KGO radio.  When I spoke of AK-47 firearms on May
6th, I was talking about the Soviet military rifle -- a fully-
automatic, not a semiautomatic, firearm -- and what I thought was
common knowledge.  Namely, that federal law has strictly
regulated the private ownership of such fully automatic firearms
for 63 years.

I didn't favor a cap put on this procedure in 1986 by the United
States Congress because no legally owned fully-automatic firearm
has ever been used in a crime.

Regrettably, the distinction between classes of firearms is still
not understood thanks to the distortions spread by the media and
those who'd destroy the Second Amendment.

That's why I lobbied against the Clinton gun ban as a private
citizen in 1994, and that is why I'll be honored to continue
defending the Second Amendment as First Vice President of the
National Rifle Association.

Sincerely,

(Signed)

Charlton Heston
