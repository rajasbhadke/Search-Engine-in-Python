        So, you say you're ready to join our family? Great! This step
        is a very important one for you and your users. A professional,
        network for you and an information packed network for your users.

        Before we get some information from you, we need to let you know
        about the sysop guidelines for U'NI-net.


SYSOP GUIDELINES:
----------------

        1)      All Member systems must make mail transfers DAILY, this
                eliminates old, dry mail and expedites replies.
                Exceptions can be made for special cases but must be
                approved by the Network Host and the affected Hub
                Sysop in advance.

        2)      A QWK/REP compatible mail package must be supported on
                your BBS for network mail transfers.

        3)      Every U'NI-net BBS is required to carry conferences:
                NETNEWS: (Network News/"Read Only". Sysops must read
                ALL messages.)
                UNI-NET: (Sysops and Hosts Conference. Sysops must read
                messages to YOU and ALL).
                UNI-HOST: (If your system provides conference host(s),
                          this conference is required)
                UNI-USERS (Allows User to contact Management)

                Not required, but strongly recommended:

                CHITCHAT (General conference, off topic messages are
                          often referred to this area)

                UNI-HELPDESK (Reference desk for questions and
                             Answers)

        4)      Sysops must monitor and participate in the ADMIN
                conference of the Hub to which they are assigned.
                This conference will contain information necessary to
                maintain efficiency and keep you advised of any changes
                in, or additions to procedures.

        5)      U'NI-net conferences can not be sold.  Subscription
                systems are welcome on the network, but there can not
                be an extra charge over and above the standard
                subscription rate for access to U'NI-net.


        6)      Have Fun !


CHANGES:
--------

        Our guidelines are always open to discussion and drafting.
        The stress is always put on making the network easier to
        administer, maximizing efficiency and providing the best
        service possible without getting stuck in bureaucracy.


NETWORK ADMINISTRATION:
----------------------

        Since the network was started by sysops with experience
        from other networks, you'll see that the administration
        is a compilation of what works best.

        Day to day decisions regarding normal operations of the
        network are handles by Network Host Cam Debuck. Major
        decisions are decided by discussion and majority vote of the
        U'NI-net Management Team.

        The Management Team is made up of the following individuals:

        Network Host
        ------------
        Cam Debuck

        Official Hubs
        -------------
        Alan Bevis
        Cam De(Old)Buck
        Dave Franks
        Dave Halliday
        Hans Joergen
        John Kirkman
        Marius Kirschner
        Osman Noor Mohamed
        Cindy Niespodzianski
        William Padilla
        Doug Reigler
        Charles Shapiro


        Recorder
        --------
        Charles Shapiro

        Conference Coordinator
        ---------------------
        John Ewin

        Members may be added or removed by a majority vote of the
        existing Management Team.

        Any member of the Team may initiate a discussion or propose a
        vote. Sysops or Users who would like to see a change made in
        the way the Network operates should contact a member of the
        Management Team regarding a vote proposal.



System Taglines
---------------

        Your netmail software will place a line of information at the
        bottom of each message created at your BBS.  This "tagline"
        includes information about your BBS.

        Please have your BBS tagline for U'NI-net conform to the
        following:

        U'NI-net: <your bbs name> ş <your city>,<your state>


        ÚÄÄÄSingle right quote mark
     Ú U'NI¿-net: <Änet: MUST be lower case with a colon & space appended
     ÀÄÄÂÄÄÙ
        ³
        ÀÄThis part MUST be upper case and followed by a hyphen ("-")

        OPTIONAL: you may also append a "ş" (Ascii 254) and the
        telephone number of your BBS if it will fit - see the
        documentation for your mail tosser program for maximum line
        length - Example:

  U'NI-net: <your bbs name> ş <bbs city>,<bbs state> ş <bbs phone #>

        Please do not put anything before the word "U'NI-net:" except
        for what your mail tosser might automatically put there.

        If you are not located in the U.S. please include the name of
        your country after your city or province as appropriate.

        Please do not use abbreviations that are not well known - LA,
        CA and NY are probably known most places - other abbreviations
        may not be understood outside of your local area.

        You may put other information (phone number or email address)
        after your location if you have room, but not at the expense
        of the required information.

        If you do not wish to use the "ş" character as a delimiter,
        you may use some other character.
