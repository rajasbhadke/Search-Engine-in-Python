INTRODUCTION TO THE 1990 MILWAUKEE SHADOWS PROJECT CATALOG

THIS SHOW WAS HELD AT THE WOODLAND PATTERN ARTS CENTER GALLERY
SUMMER, 1990

By Karl Young, Curator


The Manhattan Project was a microcosm of the nuclear age. It was 
conducted in secret. The American public did not know it was going on, 
nor did the majority of military and political personnel. Only two of 
the twelve men aboard the plane that dropped the first bomb knew what 
they were carrying when they took off. The American people were not 
asked if the bomb should be used -- they were not trusted to make the 
decisions that the president and a small circle of cohorts wanted. At 
the same time, the elite Manhattan Project scientists weren't trusted 
either: a secret army of spies kept them under surveillance. 

There you have three of the main characteristics of the nuclear age: 
secrecy, elitism, and exclusion. The next element, terror, also 
surrounded the Manhattan Project. The ostensible reason for using 
nuclear weapons was to terrify the Japanese into surrender. Japan's 
surrender, however, took a back seat to the need to spread greater 
terror in the Soviet Union. That worked so well that the U.S. and the 
U.S.S.R. have spent the succeeding forty five years terrifying the 
world by inventing ever more fiendish ways of terrifying each other. 

But opposition has also been characteristic of the age. After the 
defeat of Nazi Germany, many of the Manhattan Project scientists 
wanted to stop work on the bomb. Although their protests were muzzled, 
it is clear that opposition to nuclear weapons began BEFORE the  
first  one  was tested and before the bombing of Hiroshima. 

The 1990 International Shadows Project represents a particularly 
appropriate tradition of opposition. For over a decade people around 
the world have gone about their communities outlining each other's 
bodies in memory of those Hiroshima residents who had been vaporized 
by the first bomb. Performance artists have joined this tradition. In 
the U.S., John Held, Jr. has been indefatigable in such efforts. 
Ruggero Maggi of Milan, Italy has not only been active in 
performances, he and Held have united Mail Art and Shadows Projects. 
Maggi sponsored several shows in Italy in the mid '80's, and took part 
in organizing a major show in Hiroshima in 1988. Work from this show 
passed on to a 1989 show in Calexico, under the curatorship of Harry 
Polkinhorn. The Calexico show in turn formed the nucleus of this 
year's expanded Milwaukee show. 

Mail Art is intrinsically opposed to the secrecy, elitism, and 
exclusion of the nuclear age. It is thoroughly unhieratic. It is not 
localized in centers of power and authority, but emanates from 
everywhere and can go anywhere. Mail Art matured and continues to have 
a large following in the Fascist dictatorships of Latin America, the 
totalitarian countries of Eastern Europe, the U.S.S.R. and other 
places where political commitment has been strong and the need to 
avoid censorship has been great. Many American Mail Artists see the 
                           
genre as a means of confounding economic censorship. In addition to 
making a case against nuclear weapons, the show argues the case for 
freedom of every sort, including freedom from censorship, freedom from 
repressive governments, and freedom from class, race, and social 
prejudice. It does so by offering complete freedom of expression to 
participants. 

Although freedom from the terror of nuclear annihilation is 
foregrounded in this show, the desire for freedom from other forms of 
terror is also represented. For nearly half a century the human race 
has been enslaved by nuclear weapons and the world they have created. 
The nuclear virus has spread everywhere. Consider, for instance, that 
freedom from hunger is the most basic of freedoms. If the enormous 
resources devoted to nuclear weaponry had been directed toward 
agriculture and food distribution, we would live in a world free from 
hunger. If the ingenuity lavished on nuclear delivery systems had been 
used to develop alternative energy sources, we would be free from 
dependency on fossil fuel. Fissionable materials remain lethal for 
thousands of years. That means that we are not free to restructure 
society along different lines: someone will have to tend our nuclear 
wastes for millennia. Freedom from sociopolitical terror is also a 
basic freedom. Had we not carefully laid the foundations for terror as 
panacea forty five years ago, we would be closer to freedom from 
terror today, and terrorism would not have been elevated to the status 
of an ideology or a religion.

The nuclear age has been alive with proposals for the elimination of 
nuclear terror. Ours is simple: to answer slavery with freedom; to 
answer elitism with universal enfranchisement; to answer exclusion 
with openness; to answer expensive weaponry with art that can be 
produced inexpensively; to answer terror with visions of peace. 



SURVEY OF THE 1990 SHADOWS PROJECT SHOW

The Woodland Pattern Book Center consists of a book store and a gallery-
performance area. You enter the gallery through a hallway from the 
bookstore. In the hall we hung a participatory piece, OUR SHADOWS STAND 
TOGETHER. This is a large cloth on which visitors could draw shadows 
around each other. Pens were left at the base of the piece to facilitate 
the drawing of these shadows. I had expected a static composite, defined 
by the largest and smallest participants, with line density increasing 
toward the mean size. Participants, however, positioned themselves in 
ways that kept their shadows from repeating those that had been made 
before. Some added drawings and messages. This collective and 
spontaneous effort shows that participants weren't going to stand 
still in the middle of the cloth and simply fill in a space. They had 
their own ideas of what they wanted to do and weren't going to try to 
figure out or obey what some absent authority figure expected of them. 
As a result, they created a much more lively and profound piece than I 
had expected. This optimistic piece emphatically underscored the point 
of the whole project.

The gallery is a large, rectangular room. The design problem for the 
show was to use this space to best advantage. I made a number of 
preliminary sketches, contrasting areas of greater and lesser density 
with areas of negative space, working areas with a vertical 
orientation against horizontal and angular designs. Most design work 
beyond this was done on a day to day basis by Anne Kingsbury and Karl 
Gartung who worked out excellent solutions to difficult problems. 
Among the problems were how to keep small pieces from being 
overwhelmed by larger ones nearby, how to display envelopes, how to 
let each piece keep its individuality while interacting with the show 
as a whole. 

You enter the room from the west. At the center of the eastern wall we 
set up several cubes in the form of an altar. On the top of this we 
placed a garland of cranes made by Mizuho Kakiue specifically for this 
show. Mrs. Kakiue was a child on the outskirts of Hiroshima at the 
time of the bombing. A painting by nine year old Jules Villanueva-
Castano, the youngest contributor at the time of the opening, was 
placed below this garland. Two other crane garlands were lent to the 
show by visitors. The altar was the exhibit's centerpiece, both 
underscoring the fact that Hiroshima victims included an inordinate 
number of children, and that the consequences of continued nuclear 
insanity will be a world in which there will be no future, in which 
the succession of generations will cease. 

The north and south walls worked out the patterns mentioned above. Cut 
out and painted shadows formed a motif through all the walls, 
culminating on the western wall. Here they not only reached their 
greatest density, some were bent around angles in the wall. No 
negative space was left as visual relief or visual silence on this 
wall.

Many contributors did not address nuclear weaponry directly. Two large 
pieces by Clemente Padin of Montevideo traced shadows of Disappeared 
Persons in his country. Others addressed the same issue, as well as 
child and spouse abuse, censorship, AIDS, colonialism, and other 
horrors under the nuclear umbrella. These formed a second motif, 
asking the viewer not to see nuclear arms in too narrow a context. 

The show constantly changed. Work kept coming in past the deadline. 
Works not immediately mounted were placed on tables at the center of 
the room when it was not being used as performance space. Many 
contributors sent poetry, and some of the poems were initially placed 
on the tables. Later many were moved to the walls and eventually bound 
into books. Patrons of Woodland Pattern often sit in the store or the 
gallery and read available books. _The POETRY FROM THE SHADOWS_ books 
were read by many visitors, including those who wanted to sit down for 
a while before looking further, and by those who felt more comfortable 
reading poetry from books than on a wall.

Though the world changed drastically after the first Hiroshima Day, life 
has gone on. Those of us who have participated in this project have done 
so in the hope that humanity can continue despite its present suicidal 
course. There's more than a little crazy optimism in this hope. Maybe 
that's what will ultimately save us from ourselves.

TWO POEMS FROM THE 1990 CATALOGUE:

from _THE SEVEN HELLS OF JIGOKU ZOSHI_
         THE SEVENTH HELL: of smoke, where fire-raisers 
                             try in vain to escape 
                             from a shower of hot sand falling 
                             from a cloud


BY JEROME ROTHENBERG

The Houses of men are on fire
          Pity the dead in their graves
                    & the homes of the living
Pity the roofbeams whose waters burn till they're ash
Pity the old clouds devoured by the clouds of hot sand
& the sweat that's drawn out of metals pity that too
Pity the teeth robbed of gold
          The bones when their skin falls away
Pity man's cry when the sun the sun is born in his cities
& the thunder breaks down his door
                    & pity the rain
For the rain falls on the deserts of man & is lost

If the mind is a house that has fallen
                    Where will the eye find rest
The images rise from the marrow & cry in the blood
Pity man's voice in the smoke-filled days
          & his eyes in the darkness
Pity the sight of his eyes
                    For what can a man see in the darkness
What can he see but the children's bones & the black bones buried
But the places between spaces & the places of sand
& the places of black teeth
                    The faraway places
The black sand carried & the black bones buried
The black veins hanging from the open skin
          & the blood changed to glass in the night

The eye of man is on fire
          A green bird cries from his house
& opens a red eye to death
The sun drops out of a pine tree
                    Brushing the earth with its wings
For what can a man see in the morning
What can he see but the fire-raisers
          The shadow of the fire-raisers lost in the smoke
The shadow of the smoke where the hot sand is falling
The fire-raisers putting a torch to their arms
The green smoke ascending
                    Pity the children of man
Pity their bones when the skin falls away
Pity the skin devoured by fire
          The fire devoured by fire
The mind of man is on fire
          & where will his eye find rest

MY BEAUTIFUL HIROSHIMA TEACHER

BY KEIKO MATSUI GIBSON

Crimson sunset in Lake Michigan.
I think of a beautiful woman
in Hiroshima when the bomb was dropped.
Was she fortunate not to be killed
with the 200,000 others?
Was she fortunate to stay alive?

Bright light
crushed her breath
windows burst
she went out
she woke far off
stuck all over
with broken glass
she couldn't scream
in blood and pain
no word would do
or will ever do
she felt the end of the world

Fujiko is more beautiful because of her scars
Fujiko is more beautiful because many men and women have loved her
Fujiko is more beautiful because she has lived alone
Fujiko is more beautiful because she has taught many students
Fujiko is more beautiful because she has always 
            loved Hiroshima
Fujiko is more beautiful because she plans to live
            in a tiny farmhouse there
Fujiko is more beautiful because she does not fear
            the inevitable cancer
Fujiko is more beautiful because of her peace

The wormy scar on her neck
tells the folly of history.

THE FOLLOWING RETROSPECTIVE APPEARED IN THE 1990 SHADOWS PROJECT CATALOGUE:

SHADOW: THE INTERNATIONAL SHADOW PROJECT
CALEXICO, CALIFORNIA, AUGUST-SEPTEMBER, 1989

BY HARRY POLKINHORN, CURATOR

The Calexico Shadow Project took place in a small gallery environment 
at the Imperial Valley campus of San Diego State University. Located 
within walking distance of the U.S.-Mexico international boundary, the 
gallery featured works by artists from all over the world. During the 
planning phase, the organizers approached Ruggero Maggi of Milan, 
Italy, who has been a key figure in the International Shadow Project 
for several years now. Long active in mail art and underground 
networking of alternative art forms, Maggi forwarded many of the works 
exhibited in Japan during the 1988 event. The sponsorship of the 
Shadow Project by the California State University marks perhaps the 
first time that the Shadow Project's goals have been so supported by a 
public agency.

Of additional significance, of course, is our location on the border. 
Those who live in a bicultural context are acutely aware of the 
conflicts between values, beliefs, and customs which residing on the 
border exacerbates; they are also aware of the interdependence of 
people, our compelling need to acknowledge difference in order to 
survive under its mandate. As a place with little history; a social 
laboratory made up of in-migrants from central Mexico who mix with 
Mexican American, Anglo American, and other residents of southern 
California; the abrasive divide between a developed and a developing 
economy, spanned by the U.S.-controlled mass media -- as all of this 
and more, the border provides a very appropriate setting for the 
objectives and ideology of the International Shadow Project.

Another locus of conflict and accommodation which a border environment 
manifests is of course language itself. Visual art does not transcend 
the level on which such problems occur but substitutes alternative 
sets of codes for the verbal. Interestingly, much of the work in the 
Shadow Project features both visual and verbal systems, as if to 
underscore a drive to overcome the loss of communication which takes 
place between cultures, languages, and media. In spite of these 
preconditions, these works speak bluntly: the message is one of the 
necessity for tolerance of difference if we are to survive.
