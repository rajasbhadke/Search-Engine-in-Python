     A couple Computist articles dealt with Playroom-- one by Blackbird
and one by Jack Moravetz. Both say that that you can deprotect the
program by first making a copy of Disk 1 using any whole-disk copier
that will ignore errors. BB suggests Locksmith 6.0's Fast-copy. (Or,
formatting a ProDOS diskette and copying the individual files from Disk
1 to the new diskette may work.)

     The copy, of course, will not work. You need to change a few bytes
on your new copy. Copy II+'s sector editor works fine for this.

     If your copy is similar to the one mentioned you should find the
stuff to change on Track 05, Sector 0A. If bytes $1F-$21 are 4C 47 64,
cursor down to the first byte (using the I, J, K, M keys).  When you're
on the 4C, press H to get into Hex entry mode and type 18 [Return] 60
[Return] EA [Return]. Press ESC and Write the changed sector to the
diskette.

     The other diskettes should not be protected and can be copied with
any copier.

     Once you're sure the new copy works, you can make as many backups
as you need using any quick diskette copier.
