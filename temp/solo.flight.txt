IMPORTANT READ CAREFULLY
------------------------

 After completing your first landing since loading the game, you
will be asked
to enter a landing fee credit code (an attempt at piracy
protection). To
determine the correct response, read the account # displayed by
the computer
when it asks for authorization code. Then go to the authorization
code table
(found at the end of the doc file) and locate the account # given
by the
computer. Located directly beneath the account # is the
authorization code
response. Type the authorization code into the computer and press
'return'.



OPTIONS
-------

 Use the 1 key to select practice FLYING or the MAIL PILOT game.
The 1 key also
selects which of three states you wish to fly in. (Kansas,
Washington, or
Colorado). Use the 2 key to choose dificulty level. During flying
practice you
may select clear weather (for touch and go practice in the local
area), landing
practice (places the aircraft on short final for landing), windy
conditions, or
ifr (instrument flight rules-low clouds). When playing the mail
run game, you
may select from the student pilot, private pilot, senior pilot,
or command pilot
dificulty levels. Press 3 to continue.



BASIC FLYING
------------

 Two controls are used for the most basic flying - the control
stick or yoke and
the throttle. The joystick (yoke) changes the altitude and
direction of your
aircraft; the throttle affects your speed. Use the joystick to
make your plane
turn, climb and dive. Holding the stick to the right causes the
plane to bank to
the right; when the plane is banked right it will turn right.
Note that when you
center the joystick the plane will remain banked and continue
turning. Bring the
plane back level by pushing the stick in the opposite direction
of bank. Pushing
forward on the stick will cause your nose to go down and the
plane will dive.
Pulling back on the stick will bring your nose up. The throttle
controls the
amount of power generated by your engine. Maximum power is
required when taking
off and climbing, somewhat less power is needed for cruising, and
low power is
generally sufficient for landing.
  Remember that there is a relationship between the pitch
altitude and the
amount of power required for level flight. At low speeds,
signifacantly more
nose up is required for level flight.



VIEW
----

 The top half of the flight screen shows your plane and local
terrain
highlights. If you are at a low altitude your shadow will be
visible on the
ground. Airports are black, VOR towers, farms and mountains are
white. If you
fly into or above the clouds, ground objects will not be visible.
Generally the
view is to the front; you may look to the side or behind you
using the
appropriate commands.



INSTRUMENTS
-----------

 The bottom half of the flight screen contains your flight
instrumentation. The
large red dial on the left is your altimeter. Each mark on the
dial is 1000
feet for the small hand and corresponds to a complete revolution
of the large
hand. The large dial on the right is your speed indicator which
goes from 0 to
180 knots. The small circle in the middle is your artificial
horizon/altitude
indicator which idicates your altitude relative to the horizon.
The vertical
strip in the center is your throttle indicator. Maximum power is
at the top,
zero power is at the bottom. The four digital indicators at the
lower left are
very important. The first value is pitch, positive values
indicate your nose is
up, negative values means nose down. The next number is the
degrees of flaps
that are extended. The next value is a digital and alpha
directional compass
reading. Zero degrees is due North, 90 is East, 180 South, and
270 is West. The
bottom indication is your Vertical Velocity Indicator (climb).
Positive values
indicate you are gaining altitude, negative values indicate you
are losing
altitude. Your fuel guage is on the lower right. The indicator
light center left
is your temperature warning light. It will flash if your engine
is overheating.
The two status lamps center right indicate that your landing gear
is down and
your brakes are applied when illuminated. Your navagational
instruments are at
lower right. The two VOR readouts indicate the directional
bearing from the VOR
stations. The ILS system shows wether your landing approach is
high, low, or on
the runway. Your elapsed time is displayed at the upper right.



FLIGHT CONTROLS
---------------

 In addition to control via the joystick, a number or commands
may be entered
through the keyboard.

THROTTLE: The numbers '0' to '9' control your throttle. Zero is
no power, 9 is
maximum power.

NOISE: Press 'N' to turn on/off the engine noise.

LANDING GEAR: Press 'L' to raise or lower the landing gear.

BRAKES: Press 'B' to apply or realese the brakes.

FLAPS: Press 'F' to control the flaps. You may use 0, 20, or 40
degrees of
flaps.

VIEW: Use the left and right arrow keys to look out the right and
left windows.
Use the down arrow to look behind you. To return to the front
view, use the up
arrow key. (for II/II+ users: W-front, A-left, S-right, Z-back)

PAUSE: Press 'P' to pause the game. Press any other key to
continue.

RESTART: Press 'ESC' to restart.

EMERGENCY: If you wish to create an emergancy equipment failure
for practice
purposes, press the 'E' key.

SLIP: Bank your aircraft and press joystick button to put your
plane into a
sideslip. This manuver, usually performed by crossing the rudder
and ailerons,
allows you to slip your plane into the wind to lose altitude
without changing
heading.

JOYSTICK ADJUST: Center your joystick and press 'J' to adjust the
game to your
joystick.



MAIL PILOT
----------

 The mail pilot game tests your flying skill and judgement. Your
task is to
deliver five bags of mail to their destinations in the least
amount of time.
Once you have selected the Mail Pilot game, a map will be
displayed. Press START
to continue to the Mail Pilot screen. On the mail pilot screen
use the 1 key to
load mail. The destination(s) will be displayed on the screen
under 'MAIL FOR:'.
You may load up as much mail as you like. However, each bag adds
to the weight
of the plane and increases the dificulty of flying. One or two
bags is
recomended. You may load up on fuel by pressing the 2 key. Fuel
also adds weight
but be sure to load enough to make it to your destination. To
begin your
journey, press the 3 key. Then be sure to study the map to decide
a flight plan.
When you are ready to take off, press 3 again. If you wish to
return to the main
map at any time, press 1.
  When you arrive at your destination airport and stop your
aircraft, your
landing points are calculated. Points are gained for slow
landings with gentle
touchdowns. Delivery points are also accumulated based on
dificulty level. Next
you will be shown a map and your route will be displayed. Press 3
to go on to
the Mail Pilot screen. Any mail for this airport is automaticly
unloaded and
added to your score. You may now load additional mail or fuel and
continue the
game. The game ends when five bags have been delivered or when
you crash.
  As the game progresses, the weather will gradually deteriorate.
Winds will get
stronger, clouds may come in, and turbulence may develop. At the
higher
dificulty levels your plane is also prone to mechanical and
instrument failure.
Your engine may overheat and various instruments may become
inoperative. This is
not due to a bad crack! All malfunctions are repaired when you
land at an
airport.
  If the disk is not write protected, high scores will be
recorded on the disk.



EMERGENCIES
-----------

 At the more advanced dificulty levels your aircraft is prone to
instrument and
mechanical failure. If the temperature light begins to blink,
your engine is
overheating and will cut out shortly. Find a place to land. Your
altimeter,
airspeed indicator, and VOR indicators may also malfunction and
register zero
readings. The artificial horizon could also cease functioning.
Landing at any
airport will repair your aircraft. Multiple use of the 'E' key
will cycle the
program through all emergencies possible in the simulation.



WEATHER
-------

 The current weather conditions are displayed at the bottom of
the screen: wind
direction and speed, cloud ceiling in feet, and visibility in
miles. Under windy
conditions, landing your aircraft becomes tricky, especially if
the wind is
blowing across the runway. Use less flaps, higher airspeeds, and
aircraft slips
to compensate for winds. Low clouds often require instrument
flying, although
you may choose to fly above the clouds.



STATE MAPS
----------

Kansas: Kansas is a nice flat state, ideal for novice flyers.
Wichita and Kansas
City have airports with long, wide runways. There are also many
nice cornfields
and mysterious Indian pyramids to fly over. VOR 1/VOR2 bearings
for Kansas are:

Wichita-222/001, Lyons-252/336, Emporia-225/022
Chanute-154/052, Salina-295/353, Topeka-330/016
Kansas City-065/036.


Washington/Oregon: Washington has a mountain range seperating the
costal cities
from Chelan and Yakima. Some of the mountains are up to 4000 feet
high, although
the two mountain passes can be traversed at 2000-2500 feet. Three
of the of the
Washington airports are also elevated.

Portland-223/001, Salem-224/278, Kelso-251/350
Olympia-284/344, Seattle(500 feet elevation)-314/010
Chelan(1000 feet)-060/035, Yakima(500 feet)-142/059.


Colorado: Flying between the small airstrips nestled in the Rocky
Mountain
Valleys of Colorado is the ultimate challenge for a mail pilot:

Aspen(2000 feet)-223/001, Pueblo(1000 feet)-143/074
Glenwood(2000 feet)-264/343, Vail(2500 feet)-184/030
Denver-098/050, Boulder(500 feet)-053/037
Steamboat(2000 feet)-334/008.



CAUTIONS
--------

 Take heed of the following cautions, especially at the advanced
dificulty
levels.

1. Don't make sharp or high speed turns while taxiing. Your
landing gear struts
are delicate and are liable to ground loop.
2. Don't lose your airspeed and stall when attempting a slow
landing. Use your
flaps to lower stall airspeed.
3. Plan your route on the map before taking off. A sudden
lowering or an
emergency may hide familar landmarks or require immediate
landing.
4. Don't run your engine at full power for too long; overheating
is likely to
occure.
5. Don't overload the aircraft. With a heavy mail and fuel load,
your aircraft
will be very slugish. The aircraft will have a hard time taking
off from
elevated Colorado airports, and will require longer landing
distances.



VOR NAVIGATION
--------------

 VOR navigation is based on a series of ground stations that send
out radio
signals. These signals are received by instruments in the cockpit
and decoded
and read as bearing to a particular VOR station. There is no
range information
associated with VOR navigation. In Solo Flight, each airport is
defined as a
radial intersection. (A radial bearing is a number 0 to 360 that
if the aircraft
was turned and flown on a heading of 180 degrees from the radial
bearing, the
flight path would be inbound to the VOR station).
  North of the VOR station is radial 360, East is 90, South is
180, and West is
270. To find a particular airport, the pilot should determine its
radial
intersection from both VORs. He should then intercept a radial
outbound from one
of the VORs and fly until the cross radial from the other radial
is reached. For
example, in the Kansas map, the Kansas City airport is located on
the 36 degree
radial of VOR 2 with the end of the main runway on the end of 67
radial of VOR
1. To find the airport in the weather, the instrument pilot could
establish
himself on the 36 degree radial of VOR 2, heading 36, and descend
to missed
approach altitude until crossing the missed approach radial, the
67 of VOR 1.
