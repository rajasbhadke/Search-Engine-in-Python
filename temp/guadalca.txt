1.0  INTRODUCTION

GUADALCANAL CAMPAIGN is an operational level game featuring combat 
between U.S.and japanese air, land, surface, naval and submarine forces for 
the control of Guadalcanal in 1942. Every ship, airplane, or infantry company 
available to the local Japanese and American commanders in 1942 is now under 
your control. You will need to organize your ships into task forces to 
perform various missions: sea lane interdiction and combat, land bombardment, 
support of air operations, and others. All play revolves around the creation 
of these task forces and your effective manipulation of them. Included are a 
campaign game (covering all the action from 7 August to 31 December 1942) and 
4 mini games (featuring the major battles in the Solomons).
1.1  Description of Action
Each game turn represents the passage of 12 hours. A game turn consists 
of (1) building and adjusting friendly task forces; (2) moving your task 
forces; (3) launching air missions during daylight turns; (4) combat 
resolution.
1.2  Talking to the Computer
To enter a response to the computer that consists of numbers (such as 
ship or task force identification numbers or the number of aircraft 
performing a mission), type the number into the computer and press the return 
key. To select a routine from the Task force Menu or answer a Yes/No 
question,just press the desired key. if you wish to halt the game during the 
combat resolution phase, type CNTRL-C. This will cause the program to pause 
until you press another key.
1.3  Saving a Game
Upon completion of the Combat Phase of each turn the computer will 
allow the player(s) to save the game in progress.You will need a scratch disk 
to store the saved game data. Each disk may save up to 4 games. The disk must 
be initialized for SSI use by following the instructions included in the 
program. Once the game is saved you will be able to restart it from the point 
at which you left off.
1.4  The Map
The map is a 40 X 40 square grid representation of the Southwest 
Pacific with each square measuring 60 nautical miles in width. Green squares 
are land, white squares are bases or ports, red squares are Japanese task 
forces, blue squares are U.S. task forces, black squares are open ocean. Each 
space is 60 nautical miles wide. The range between two squares is calculated 
from the center of the first square to the center of the second square. The 
number thus obtained is rounded up. Example: 5 squares over, 1 square up, 
equals range of 5.099 or 6.
1.5  Starting a Game (DOS 3.2 or DOS 3.3)
To begin a game, boot your game disc and the game will begin 
automatically. If you are using an Apple II with Pascal, you must first use 
your BASICS disc. If you are using an Apple III you must first go into Apple 
II Emulation Mode.

3.2  Historical Set-up
At the start of each game the computer will assign all ships,aircraft, 
infantry and supplies to their historical locations prior to the battle.
3.3  Daytime (AM) Sequence
A. American TF adjustment phase
B. American movement phase
C. Japanese Tf adjustment phase
D. Japanese movement phase
E. Japanese air operations phase
F. American air operations phase
G. Combat resolution phase
H. Save game phase
3.4  Nighttime (PM) Sequence
The PM sequence is the same as the AM sequence except steps E and F are 
deleted.
3.5  Keeping Time
An AM turn followed by a PM turn equals one day. The calendar is 
adjusted at the end of the PM turn.
4.0  TASK FORCE ADJUSTMENT PHASE
At the start of the task force adjustment phase the computer will 
display a menu listing four options for adjusting your forces and six options 
for reviewing the status of your forces. To enter the desired routine just 
press the corresponding numbered or lettered key.
4.1  Forming Task Forces
A. Enter the code for the port in which you will assemble your TF (E, 
B, R,T).
B.  Enter the code for the mission your TF will perform. See section
   9.2 for a list of the possible missions.
C. The computer will list those ships in the selected port that are
  eligible to perform the selected mission. Each ship will be displayed with 
its I.D. number.
D. Assemble your TF by entering the desired ship numbers. In some cases 
the screen cannot list all of the eligible ships at once; if you do not see 
the ships that you want, press <RETURN> and another batch of ships will be 
listed.
E. When the computer prompts "CONTINUE SELECTION Y/N" Press <Y> if you 
are satisfied with your selection. Press <N> and the computer will run 
through the list again.
4.2  Combining TFs
Two Tfs occupying the same grid location may be combined. In the 
following manner:
A. Enter the number of the "gaining" TF and the "merging" TF.
B. All ships in the "merging" TF will be added to the "gaining" TF and 
the merging TF will be deleted.
C. If the merging TF had a lower endurance level then the gaining TF 
will assume that endurance level.
D. If the merging TF had an "R" or "FR" mission then the gaining TF   
will assume an "R" mission.
E. Submarine TFs may not combine with non-submarine TFs.
4.3 Dividing TFs
A. Enter the number of the TF you wish to divide. The computer will 
list the ships in the selected TF. A ship with "*** " printed after its name 
is crippled.
B. If you already have seven active TFs in play, the computer will   
display the message "TOO MANY ACTIVE TFS" and return to the menu.
C. Enter the number of the ships you wish to transfer to a new TF. The 
computer will set up a new TF for you. The new TF will have the same mission 
and endurance as the original TF.
D. When there are six or fewer friendly TFs in play the DIVIDE TF 
function maybe used to "scuttle" crippled ships, just enter the letter "S" 
following the number of the ship you are transferring. Your opponent will 
receive one less victory point for ships that are scuttled than would 
ordinarily be rewarded for a ship sunk involuntarily (your crew is assumed to 
have been removed safely).
4.4  Loading Transports
Before troops and supplies may be moved to Guadalcanal they must first 
be loaded onto ships in a friendly port.
A. Use the LOAD TRANSPORTs-TRAIN CV PILOTS routine, enter the code for 
the port in which the loading is to take place. The computer will list all 
eligible ships in that port with a cargo capacity greater than zero.
B. Enter the number of the ship you wish to load and then enter the 
number of infantry companies and/or supply units you wish to load. Each 
infantry company represents 200 men.
C. If you wish to unload cargo while still in port type a U in response 
to the question "number of infantry companies/supply units to be loaded". By 
typing a U the current cargo will be unloaded.
4.5  Training Carrier Pilots
To replace losses for depleted carrier air groups, land-based aircraft 
(pilots) must be trained for carrier operations.
A. Use the LOAD TRANSPORTS-TRAIN CV PILOTS routine. Select the code for 
the port that is furnishing the aircraft for training. The carrier must 
already be assigned to this port.
B. Enter the number of the carrier that is to receive the aircraft.
C. The computer will list all of the aircraft available in the port. 
Enter the quantity you wish to transfer.
D. The carrier will be taken out of circulation for 15 days while the 
"training" is being accomplished.
E. Betty, Nell and fortress aircraft may never operate from carriers.
4.6  Checking the Pipeline
Reinforcements and repaired vessels will periodically be sent to ports 
you control. To check the status of these units, you may request the current 
condition of your ship "pipeline".
A. Enter the code (E, B, R, T) for the port you wish to check.
B. The computer will list all ships currently in that port and all 
ships due to arrive there.
C. For ships in the repair, refit or reinforcement "pipeline" the  
computer will list the time in days before that ship can return or arrive.
4.7  Sunk Ships Display
The computer will list all ships that have been sunk and the points 
awarded for their sinking.
4.8 Air Group Display
The computer will display the number of each type of aircraft assigned 
to each friendly airbase or carrier that is active.
4.9 List Active TFs
A. The computer lists the TF number, mission and endurance for each 
friendly TF currently in play.
B. The computer will prompt "CHECK SHiP STATUS Y/N". If you wish to 
examine the ships in a particular TF then press <Y> and then enter the number 
of the TF you wish to examine.
4.10  Map Display
The computer will display the map and all friendly active TFs. If you 
wish to locate a particular friendly TF on the map then enter that TFs 
number. The TF's square will flash to indicate its location.
4.11  Guadalcanal Status Display
The computer will display the number of troops and supply dumps you 
control on Guadalcanal.
4.12  Ending the Game
Both players should agree before ending the game. The computer will 
display the final score.
5.0  TASK FORCE MOVEMENT
TFs move by expending movement points. The number of movement points a 
TF is allowed is dependent on the TFs "fleet speed".
5.1  Fleet Speed
A.  A TF's fleet speed is calculated as 25 knots or the speed of the 
slowest ship in the TF, whichever is Lower.
B. The speed of a TF which is assigned a "fast" mission will be 30 
knots or the speed of the slowest ship in the TF, whichever is lower.
5.2  Movement
A. A TF receives 1 movement point for each 2 1/2 knots of fleet speed. 
A TF will receive a minimum of 3 movement points.
B. A TF expends 2 movement points for each square moved in directions 
N, S, E, W. C. A TF expends 3 movement points for each square moved in 
directions NW, NE, SW, SE.
D. A TF with fewer than 2 points remaining in its move may not move any 
further, but it may still "dock".
E. If you accidently press the wrong key while moving,you may then 
press the <A>bort key and start your move over.This may not be done after you 
have docked a TF.
F. A TF may never enter a land square. A TF may move freely through any 
other square.
5.3  Movement Sequence
A. During the movement phase friendly TFs must be moved sequentially 
according to TF number. Once a TF has completed its move the action cannot be 
reversed.
B. A player may examine the ships in a TF at any time during the TFs 
movement segment. Press the <S>hips key and the computer will give a complete 
status display for each ship in the TF. The column heading abbreviations for 
the display are as follows: MG = main guns, AA= light guns, TT= torpedoes, CC 
- cargo/aircraft capacity, MS = maximum speed, IF = infantry companies on 
board,  SU = supply units on board, DM = damage percentage.
6.0  PLANNING LAND ATTACKS
During AM turns the computer will display the number of troops and 
supplies available and if you are eligible to attack the computer will prompt 
"DO YOU WlSH TOATTACK Y/N".
A. To attack press <Y> and then enter the level (1 to 5) of your attack.
B. A level 1 attack is a reconnaissance in force and will consume 1 
supply dump. A level 5 attack is an all out Banzai charge and will consume 5 
supply dumps, etc.
C. If supply is in sufficient for the planned level of attack then the 
attack will not occur.
7.O  AIR OPERATIONS
During the Air Operations phase a player may (1) launch CAP and search 
aircraft (2) observe search results (3) launch airstrikes (4) prepare 
counterstrikes (5) transfer aircraft.
7.1  CAP and Search Missions.
A. At the start of each Air Operations Phase each player must determine 
how manyof his fighters will fly CAP missions and how many of his bombers 
will fly search missions. Aircraft performing CAP or Search may not 
participate in Air Strikes during that turn.
B. Fighters may fly two types of CAP missions: (1) normal CAPand (2) 
Long Range CAP. Normal CAP will protect only the TF or Airbase from which it 
originated. Long Range CAPwiII protect any friendly TF within a 5 square 
range of the launching base or carrier. Only a fractlon of an air group 
performing Long Range CAP will intercept an enemy air strike (the greater the 
distance between the CAP's home base and the air strike target - the smaller 
the fraction). The percentage of planes intercepting is as follows:           
3O
Range of Target% of CAP Intercepting
076
143
230
323
418
515
C. Bombers may fly two types of Search Missions: (1) normaI search and 
(2) sub search. Normal Search Missions can detect only enemy surface TF's. 
Sub Search missions can detect only enemy submarines.
D. Each active airbase is equipped with 10 float planes which 
automatically fly search missions every AM turn. These planes fly 
independently (they will not fly in conjunction with bombers flying from the 
same airbase). Thesefloatplanes may never be destroyed.
E. All BB, CA, CL, CLAA and CS class ships are equipped with float 
planes. The cruisers Tone and Chikuma and all CS cIass ships will each add 3 
float planes to its TFs search mission. All the other listed ships will add 1 
float plane to its TF's search mission. Float pIanes will only perform normal 
search. A ship which suffers any damage at all can no longer launch its fIoat 
planes. Ship launched floatplanes will search separately from bombers.
F. Search ranges for aircraft are listed below:
DAUNTLESS10FORTRESS 20BETTY20
AVENGER10VAL12NELL20
DEVASTATOR 6KATE12FLOAT20
Range is calculated as shown in section 1.4.
G. The maximum search range of a base or TF is equal to the search 
range of the lowest range search plane.
7.2  Search Results Display.
A. During the Search Phase the computer will list the numbers of each 
enemy TF sighted and display its location on the map with the appropriate Red 
or Blue square.
B. If you wish to examine the contents of an enemy TF just type the TF 
number and press Return. The computer will list the symbols for each ship 
assigned to that TF. (CV, BB,CA,CL, DD, etc.) The computer will also cause 
the TFs location square to flash on the map. The ship types reported maybe 
incorrect as might be the number of ships reported sighted. You may only look 
at each sighted TF once per search phase.
C. Press <E> to exit the Search Results Display.
7.3 Launching Air Strikes.
Enemy TFs sighted on the Search Results Display may be attacked by 
available friendly aircraft within range.
A. The computer wilI request a targed for each friendly active 
airbase/carrier. Type in the TF number of the enemy TF you wish to attack. 
The computer will list the range to the target and
ask you how many of each type of aircraft you want to launch.
The computer will not allow you to launch aircraft beyond their range. The 
computer will not allow you to attack unsighted enemy TFs. Each TF or base 
may launch only one airstrike per turn. However, each TF may launch one 
airstrike and also prepare a counterstrike.
B. The Japanese player may bomb Henderson field by targeting TF#1. The 
Americans may bomb the Cape Esperance Supply Base by targeting TF #11.
C. The ONLY bases that may be attacked are those listed in paragraph 
7.3.B.
D. The Attack Ranges for aircraft are listed below:
Wildcat5Zeke15
Dauntless5Val 6
Avenger5Kate 6
Devastator3Betty15
Fortress18Nell15
E. Zeke and Wildcat aircraft may be included in Air Strikes but they 
may never attack enemy surface or submarine targets. They function as escorts 
to protect the bombers and shoot down enemy CAP.
7.4  Preparing CounterStrikes.
Aircraft Carriers may reserve none, some, or all of their aircraft for 
Counterstrike Missions. If the carriers TF is attacked by an enemy carrier 
air group then the counterstriking aircraft will "follow" that air group home 
and attack the enemy carriers TF.
A. Duringthe Counterstrike Preparation Phase the computer will list the 
remaining (those not flying CAP, Search or Strike missions) carrier 
aircraftand ask how many of each you plan to reserve for counterstrikes.
B. If a carrier receives 26% or greater damage or has its speed reduced 
below 15 knots then it cannot launch its counterstrike.
C. Airbases may never prepare counterstrikes.
D. Counterstrikes will never attack enemy airbases.
E. Counterstrike aircraft on the decks of carriers may explode if the 
carrier is hit by bombs, torpedoes or gunfire. Each aircraft that explodes 
will cause 1 damage point. US carriers are only vulnerableto aircraft 
exploding on deck duringthe Coral Sea minigame.
7.5  Aircraft Transfers.
Aircraft may be transferred freely between airbases and/or carriers 
with the following restrictions.
A. Only 1 air transfer mission may be performed each AM turn.
B. Fortress aircraft may never transfer.
C. Aircraft may never transfer from an airbase to a carrier (this 
requires pilot training - see para. 4.5)
D. for transfer purposes aircraft have their range tripled.
E. The Japanese may transfer only Zeke aircraft into the Shortlands 
Airbase.
7.6  Airbases.
A. The Japanese player may operate aircraft from the following  
airbases: Rabaul, Truk and Shortlands. The Shortlands Airbase does not become 
active until October 7th.
B. The American Player may operate aircraft from the following 
airbases: Henderson fieId, Espiritu Santo and Brisbane. The Henderson field 
Airbase does not become active until August 20th.
8.0  COMBAT RESOLUTION
During the Combat Resolution Phase the computer will automatically 
perform the following functions:
(1) Airstrike Resolution
(2) Surface and submarine combat resolution
(3) CoastaI Bombardment
(4) Return aircraft to their bases and carriers
(5) Launch and Resolve Counterstrikes
(6) Return aircraft to carriers
(7) Unload Transports
(8) Resovve combat on Guadalcanal
(9) Repair & Refit of ships
(10) Activate Reinforcements.
8.1  Air Strike Resolution.
Each Air Strike is resolved in 3 segments:
(1) CAP resolution
(2) flak Resolution
(3) Bomb or torpedo hit resolution.
A. Before an airstrike group can attack an enemy TF or base it must 
first suurvive the onslaught of each CAP fighter group protecting the target. 
Individual CAP fighters will randomly select a bomber or escort fighter 
target and attack it. If the attack fails to shootdown the target aircraft 
then the target aircraft will counter-attack. This sequence is repeated for 
each participating CAP fighter.
B.  An example of CAP target selection is as follows: if an airstrike 
has 10 escort fighters and 20 bombers then each CAP fighter will have a 33% 
chance of selecting an escort fighter for a target and a 67% chance of 
selecting a bomber for a target.
C. The folIowing table shows the chances for a CAP fighter to destroy 
each type of aircraft and the chances of a counter-attack destroying the CAP 
fiChter:
AIRCRAFT SHOOTS DOWN
  AIRCRAFT SHOT DOWNCAP FlGHTER
Zeke18% (27%)22% (13%)
Wildcat18%22%
Val35% 5%
Dauntless35% 5%
Kate35 5%
Avenger35% 5%
Devastator35% 5%
Betty35% (52%) 5% (1%)
Fortress10%10%
The numbers in parentheses are for Rabaul-based aircraft making LONG 
RANGE STRlKES.
D. Each bomber that survives CAP combat will select a target ship from 
those in the target TF and attempt to penetrate the TF's flak and deliver its 
ordnance. Target selection is accomplished in the following manner: each ship 
is assigned a selection value (SV) equal to its Defense factor plus ten times 
its cargo/aircraft capacity. The chance of a particular ship being attacked 
is equal to the SV of that ship divided by the combined SV of the target TF.
E. The chance of a bomber being shot down by flak is equal to the TF 
Flak Strength divided by 500. If there are more than 12 ships in the TF then 
the TF Flak Strength is equal to the Average AA rating for sips in the TF 
times 12. For Japanese TFs the Flak Strength will be halved. (Japanese AA 
fire was usually ineffective.) AA fire directed at B-17's will only be 1/10 
as effective as against all other aircraft.
F. The chances of bombers hitting their targets are affected by: (1) 
bomber accuracy (2) maximum speed of target (3) flak intensity (4) the range 
of the strike (5) size of target. The relative accuracy of each bomber is 
listed below:
FORTRESS 1BETTY 4
AVENGER 2KATE 8
DEVASTATOR 2VAL16
DAUNTLESS12NELL2
All bombers are equally accurate when attacking enemy bases except the 
FORTRESS which wiLl cause twice the damage of the other bombers. Air strikes 
against bases can only destroy parked aircraft or supply dumps.
G. The first airstrike on any particular submarine will cause the 
submarine to submerge.The act of submerging will protect the submarine from 
further air attacks during that turn.
8.2  Surface Combat Resolution.
Surface combat may occur between opposing TFs that occupy the same 
space if at least one of theTF's is performing a Combat Patrol Mission (C) 
and has an endurance of at least 9.
A.  Surface combat is resolved using the following sequence: (1) each 
U.S. ship in a TF performing a "C" mission will fire at one of the ships from 
one of the Japanese TFs in the same space (2) each Japanese ship that 
occupies the same space as the attacking U.S. TF will fire at one of the 
ships from the attacking TF (3) each Japanese ship in a TF performing a"C" 
mission will fire at one of the ships from any U.S. TF that occuppies the 
same space (4) each U.S. ship that occuppies the same space as the attacking 
Japanese TF will fire at one of the ships from the attacking TF.
B. Target selection for surface combat is similar to that used for air 
attacks. In surface combat a ship selection value (SV) is equal to that 
ship's defense factor.
C. When attacking, each shipwill (1) fire torpedoes (2) fire main guns 
(3) fire secondary guns. Ships carrying 12 or more torpedoes will fire half 
of them at the target. Ships carrying less than 12 torpedoes will fire all of 
them at the target.
D. The accuracy of gun fire and torpedoes is adjusted according to the 
speed and size of the target. Japanese surface launched torpedoes will be 8 
times more accurate than U.S. surface launched torpedoes. Japanese gunfire 
will be twice as accurate as U.S. gunfire except the U.S. battleships which 
will be 50% more accurate with gunfire than the Japanese.
E. During the first 7 days of the campaign game U.S. ships will suffer 
a major disadvantage in surface combat.
F. The following restrictions apply during daylight surface combat: (a) 
AA guns will not fire at ships with main guns. (b) IJN torpedo accuracyis 
reduced by 2/3 when firing at uncrippled ships. (c) USN ships wilI only fire 
torpedoes at crippled ships.
G. APDs and DMSs will fire only 50% of the time during surface combat. 
TRs, TKs, CVs, and CVLs will never fire. A ship that picks as its target a 
ship that has already sustained enough damage to sink, will not fire. A ship 
that picks as its target a carrier, will onIy fire if it has a speed greater 
than the carrier.
8.3 Submarine Combat.
A. Submarines patrol an area up to 2 spaces away from their actual TF 
location.
B. Each sub in a TF will have about a 10% chance of attacking an enemy 
surface TF within its patrol area. Each sub in a TF will have about a 2% 
chance of attacking an enemy sub TF within its patroI area.
C. The chance of engaging and torpedoing an enemyship will be reduced 
by the number of escorts (DD, DMS, APD) present in the defending TF.
D. A sub which has been sighted by enemy sub search will have its 
chance for successful attack reduced and its chance of being sunk by "depth 
charge: increased.
E. When attacking, submarines will fire a salvo of 6 torpedoes OR all 
of their remaining torpedoes, whichever is less.
F. Japanese submarine torpedoes will be 2.5 times more accurate than 
U.S. submarine torpedoes.
G. After a submarine launches an attack opposing escorts will fire 
depth charges at the sub. American depth charges are twice as effective as 
Japanese depth charges.
8.4  Coastal Bombardment.
If a TF with a "B" mission ends its move on the Henderson field base 
square then it will automatically bombard during the combat resolution phase 
(unless forced to abort due to surface combat).
A. Japanese bombardments will destroy parked aircraft and supply dumps 
on Henderson field.
B. U.S. bombardments will destroy Japanese supply dumps.
C. A ship which has sustained 10$ or greater damage will not bombard. 
D. Only the four "heaviest" ships in a bombardment TF will bombard.
E. For bombardment purposes BB main guns have 12 times the firepower of 
all other main guns and 24 times the firepower of AA guns.
F. Bombardment missions may be aborted if the TF engages in surface 
combat with a large enemy TF.
8.5 Aircraft Returning to Base.
A. After completing their missions, aircraft will attempt to return to 
the same base or carrier from which they were launched.
B. If launched from a carrier which received 26% or more damage or had 
its speed reduced below 15 knots, the aircraft will try to make an 
"emergency" landing on another carrier or base.
C. Emergency ;andings will; occur automatically if there is a friendly 
base or carrier within 3 squares of the origin carrier.
D. If an emergency landing is required and there are no eligible bases 
or carriers within 3 squares then the aircraft will ditch in the ocean.
E. Strike aircraft will land before Counterstrikes are launched. CAP 
and Search aircraft will land after all other air operations have been 
completed.
8.6  Unloading Transports.
Any ship carrying troops or supplies, whose TF ends its move on the 
Henderson field space, will unload some or all of its passenger/cargo on 
Guadalcanal.
A. A ship can unload a maximum of 2 infantry companies OR 1 supply dump 
OR 1 infantry company and one supply dump in a single turn.
B. Infantry and supplies may be used for land combat on the same turn 
they are unloaded.
8.7  Land Combat.
Planned land attacks (see section 6.0) will be executed during the 
combat resolution phase. First U.S. attack resolution will be completed, then 
Japanese attack resolution.
    A.  All available attacker forces will participate in the attack and are 
subject to casualties. The U.S. force must reserve 9,000 men (45 companies) 
to defend Henderson FieId, these 9,000 men are NOT AVAlLABLE to attack. The 
U.S. forces will not attack with less than 10,000 men on Guadalcanal.
B. Land attack procedure is as follows: (1) defender forces open fire 
inflicting casualties on the attacker (2) surviving attacker forces inflict 
casualties on the defender (3) the computer gives an estimate of the 
remaining defender forces (+/- 50%).
C. Defending against Japanese attacks will consume 1 U.S.supply dump. 
If there are no U.S.supply dumps on Henderson field then U.S. casualties will 
be DOUBLED.
D. As a general rule, the higher the level of attack (1-5) the greater 
the casualties infIicted on both sides.
8.8  Repair and Refit of Ships.
A. Damaged ships which docked during the previous movement phase are 
placed in the REPAIR PIPELINE. Undamaged CV, CVL, BB, TR and SS cIass ships 
will be placed in the REfIT PIPELINE. Damaged CV, CVL, BB, TR and SS class 
ships must complete both REPAIR and REfIT PIPELINE functions before they can 
be reactivated. REfIT requires one week in Truk or Brisbane and two weeks in 
Rabaul or Espiritu Santo. (Submarines require only one week REFIT 
irrespective of port.) A TF that docks with an endurance remaining greater 
than 50 will not be required to REFIT.
B. Undamaged ships (other than those mentioned in para. A), which 
docked during the previous movement phase, do NOT require REFIT. These ships 
may be placed in a TF with a full endurance during the next TF Adjustment 
Phase.
C. The average number of turns needed for repair is equal to 8 to 10 x 
damage points suffered. Repairs performed in Rabaul and Espiritu Santo will 
require 20% longer than the formula given above. The number of damage points 
sustained by a ship can be calculated by multiplying the ship's DF by the 
percentage damaged. Also, repair time for a ship may be doubled with smaller 
ships having a greater chance of lengthened repair time (there is 71% chance 
that an average DD's repair time will be doubled while a US BB has only a 6% 
chance of requiring double repair time).
8.9  Reinforcement Arrival.
Ship reinforcements will arrive on a day to day basis as scheduled on 
the Pipeline Display. Infantry and aircraft reinforcement may arrive during 
AM game turns. Infantry and aircraft reinforcements will be as follows:
   INF CO.    ZEKE    VAL    KATE    BETTY
RABAUL11180024R
TRUK 0 776 0
SHORTLANDS 018R00 0
   INF CO.   WILDCAT  DAUNTLESS  AVENGER  FORTRESS
ESPlRlTU SANTO 8 763 3
BRlSBANE 0 784 0
A. Aircraft reinforcements coded "R" are actually replacements. Rabaul 
will only receive Betty replacements if there are less than 40 Bettys 
currently on hand. Rabaul or Shortlands will only receive Zeke replacements 
if there are less than 30 Zekes on hand.
B. If Shortlands receives Zeke replacements then Rabaul will not 
receive Zeke replacements.
C. Shortlands will not receive any aircraft until after October 6th.
D. Each AM turn there is a 1/7 chance of occurrence for each of the 
foIIowing events:
1) Infantry reinforcements arrive in Rabaul and air reinforceforcements 
arrive in Truk.
2) Air replacements arrive in Rabaul and Shortlands.
3) Infantry reinforcements arrive in Espiritu Santo and air 
reinforcements arrive in Brisbane.
4) Air reinforcements arrive in Espiritu Santo.
9.0  GENERAL OPERATIONS
9.1  Damage To Ships.
Ships accrue damage "points" when they are hit by bombs, torpedoes or 
gunfire. When the totaI damage points are greater than or equal to 50% of a 
ships DF then that ship is "Crippled".
A. A table listing the average damage points caused by each type of 
weapon is shown below:
Light (AA) gun    .5Bomb3
CL main gun121 inch torpedo5
CA main gun224 inch torpedo9
Yamato main gun9
US BB main gun8
Mutsu main gun7
Other Japanese BB main gun6
21 inch torpedo hits will reduce a ship's maximum speed by at least 5 
knots. 24 inch torpedo hits will reduce a ship's maximum speed by at least 10 
knots. Only Japanese surface ships carrythe 24 inch torpedo. Whenever a ship 
is hit it may suffer additional damage due to a critical hit. The message 
"explosion on board the..." reveaIs that a critical hit has been scored.
B. CV and CVL class ships with 26% or more damage or a maximum speed 
less than 15 knots may not launch or land aircraft. Note: This means that 
carriers in TFs reduced to 5 knots due to 0 endurance wlll not be able to 
launch aircraft.
C. Ships with 10% or more damage will not bombard enemy bases.
D. Crippled ships have a maximum speed of 5 knots and may accrue 
additional damage while returning to port. Major additional damage will be 
shown by the message "explosion on board the...". It is also possible for a 
ship to repair itself while at sea. Repairs will be attempted until the ship 
is no longer crippled.
9.2 TF Missions.
Listed below are the missions that may be assigned to a TF and the 
endurance allowed for each mission:
C - Combat Patrol:endurance = 60 turns (30 days)
B - Bombardment:endurance = 60
T - Transport:endurance = 60
U - Submarine:endurance = 80
FC- Fast Combat Patrol:endurance =  6
FB- Fast Bombardment:endurance =  6
FT- Fast Transport:endurance =  6
R - Return
FR- Fast Return
A. When a TF completes or aborts a mission then its mission will be 
changed to R.
B. Carriers (CV, CVL ships) may only perform "C" missions.
C. Transports (TR ships) may only perform "T" missions.
D. Submarines (SS ships) may only perform "U" missions.
E. Only TFs with "C" or "FC" missions may initiate surface combat.
F. Only TFs with "B" or "FB" missions may perform coastal bombardment.
G. An FB TF that completes its bombardment will have its mission 
changed to FC.
H. A fast TF that aborts its mission due to surface combat (see section 
9.3 D) will have its mission changed to FR. A TF that has had its mission 
changed to FR may not unload its cargo on Guadalcanal. 
L. Surface combat may cause a FB or B TF to abort its mission (see 
section 9.3 D).
9.3 TF Endurance.
A. A TF's endurance is reduced by one for each turn it spends at sea.
B. A TF's endurance is reduced to 10 if the TF is attacked by enemy 
bombers. if the endurance is already less than 10 then it is unaffected. 
Fortress attacks of greater than 7 squares in range will not affect 
endurance. Transport TFs will never be reduced.
C. A carrier TF's endurance wiLl be reduced by 5% for each air strike 
that it launches.
D. Surface combat reduces endurance as follows: The attacking TFs 
endurance is reduced to 8 (if currently greaterthan 8) If the defending TF's 
combined defense factors multiplied by a random number between 0 and 1 is 
greater than 25 ((total DF of all defending ships) x rnd (1) > 25). The 
defending TF's endurance is reduced to 8 (if currently greater than 8) If the 
total attacker main guns multiplied by a random number between 0 and 1 is 
greater than 15 ( (total MG of all attacking ships) x rnd (1) > 15). For 
these purposes the MG of battleships is multiplied by 4 (battleships will 
tend to scare off enemy TFs). The reduction in endurance given above will 
cause a Bombardment force to abort its mission and prevent fast TF's from 
unloading cargo on Guadalcanal.
E. If a TF's endurance reaches zero and it fails to dock during that 
turn then all of its ships will have their maximum speed reduced to 5 knots. 
F. Subs with 0 endurance may not fire torpedoes.
9.4  Supply.
Supply dumps are used only by infantry and aircraft units on 
GuadaIcanal.
A. Supply dumps are consumed as follows:
Infantry attack  1 to 5
U.S. daily supply1
Japanese daily supply1
Henderson Field Air Strike1
U.S. Infantry defensive fire1
Henderson Field search/sub-search/cap missions0
B. Henderson Field may not conduct air operations if there are less 
than 3 supply points available.
C. Both U.S. and Japanese infantry on Guadalcanal will sufter 1% 
attrition each day there are no supplies available.
D. U.S. infantry will suffer DOUBLED casualties from Japanese infantry 
attacks if there are no U.S. supply dumps available.
9.5 Scoring.
A. Each player receives 1 victory point (VP) for each infantry company 
on GuadalcanaI at the end of the game.
B. Players receive VPs for sinking enemy ships equal to that ships 
Defense Factor plus its cargo/aircraft capacity. Players receive 1 VP for 
each damage point inflicted on an enemy ship at sea at the end of the game. 
Players also receive 1 VP for each week a ship is out of action as of the end 
of the game. However, they do not receive points for the first two weeks a 
ship is out of action as of the end of the game. (This allows time for 
refitting as opposed to repair time.)
C. The player controlling Henderson Field receives 500 VPs at the end 
of the game. (The game ends immediately if the Japanese capture Henderson.) 
Henderson Field is captured by the Japanese if the Japanese attack, reduce US 
infantry strength on Guadalcanal to 0, and have at least one remaining 
company on the island.
D. The current score is summarized at the beginning of each turn.
E. Subtract US victory points from IJN victory points and compare the 
result to the following table to determine the victor:
1,000 and upJapanese Decisive Victory
  500 to 999Japanese Substantive Victory
  100 to 499Japanese Marginal Victory
  +99 to -99Draw
 -100 to -499American Marginal Victory
 -500 to -999American Substantive Victory
-1000 and lessAmerican Decisive Victory
9.6 Weather
There are three levels of weather, clear, light overcast and heavy 
overcast. The weather is clear at the start of each game.
A. Weather will influence the ability to spot enemy task forces at 
ranges greater than 1.5. The chance of spotting TF's at ranges over 1.5 is 
reduced by 1/3 during light overcast, and by 2/3 during heavy overcast.
B. There is a random chance each turn that the weather will change. The 
weather is graduated such that in any one turn the weather could not change 
from clear to heavy overcast, it would have to change to light overcast, 
before it could become heavy overcast. The weather can change a maximum of 
one level per turn.
9.7 Limitations on Airbases
A. Henderson Field has a maximum capacity for aircraft of 100.
B. Only Zekes may be transfered onto the Shortlands. Other aircraft may 
land on the Shortlands if forced to due to the loss of a carriers flightdeck. 
Shortlands has a maximum capacity of 60 aircraft.
9.8  Short Campaign Game (October 1 - December 31)
Players may start the campaign on October 1st by choosing the CAMPAlGN 
.2 option from the initial menu. All campaign game rules apply, with the only 
change being that the victory point schedule is changed to the following:
1200 and upJapanese Decisive Victory
 700 to 999Japanese Substantive Victory
  30 to 699Japanese Marginal Victory
 101 to 299Draw
 100 to -299American Marginal Victory
-300 to -799American Substantive Victory
-800 and lessAmerican Decisive Victory
10.0  MINI-GAMES
The Guadalcanal Campaign includes 4 mini games: Coral Sea, Eastern 
Solomons, Santa Cruz and Guadalcanal. Due to their limited scope the mini 
games include some special rules and restrictions.
10.1  Mini Game Special Rules.
A. The U.S. pIayer does not receive 500 VPs for controlling Henderson 
Field at the end of a mini-game.
B. New TFs may not be formed during Mini games. (Exception: the 
Japanese may form a new TF at Rabaul in the Guadalcanalmini-game)
C. TFs may NEVER dock during a mini-game.
D. In the Eastern Solomons Mini game the Japanese player receives 75 
VPs for play balance.
E. No reinforcements will arrive during mini games.
F. The VP total shown each turn includes VPs for infantry on 
Guadalcanal (or Port Moresby) and damage caused to ships.
10.2  Coral Sea Exclusive Rules.
A. Infantry attacks may not occur during the Coral Sea Mini Game.
B. Japanese Transports may unload infantry units on Port Moresby. Both 
players receive 1 VP for each infantry company on Port Moresby at the end of 
the game (0 VPs for infantry on Guadalcanal).
C. The Japanese may bomb the Port Moresby Base by targeting TF#1 during 
the Air Strike Phase.
D. During this scenario only, U.S. aircraft may operate from the 
following bases: Port Moresby and Cooktown. Port Moresby is limited to a 
maximum of 100 planes.
E. The weather is heavy overcast at the start of the mini game.
F. The U.S. player may use his two tankers to refuel TFs at sea. TFs 
with an endurance under 20 and in the same square as a tanker will be given 
an endurance of 25. Each tanker may refuel two TF's during the game with the 
amount of fuel remaining being shown under supply points remaining on the 
tanker. The Tippecanoe is considered to have refueled U.S. TF #5 on the first 
turn of the game and may only refuel one more TF during the game.
10.3  Mini Game Duration. 
Mini Games will end after a specified number of turns. MiniGame 
durations are listed below:
Coral Sea12 turns
Eastern Solomons 4 turns
Guadalcanal 8 turns
10.4  Mini Game Levels of Victory
Subtract US victory points from IJN victory points and compare the 
result to the following table to determine the victory:
125 and upJapanese Decisive Victory
 75 to 124Japanese Substantive Victory
 25 to 74Japanese Marginal Victory
-24 to 24Draw
-25 to -74American Marginal Victory
-75 to -124American Substantive Victory
    -125 and lessAmerican Decisive Victory
11.0  SOLITAIRE PLAY
When playing solitaire games, the computer will command the Japanese 
Forces.
A. There are 4 levels of solitaire difficulty. The level of difficulty 
is determined at the start of the game. At level 4 the Japanese weapons will 
perform according to their historical accuracy. As the level number is 
decreased the Japanese bomb, torpedo and gunfire accuracy will increase. 
These levels may be used to handicap a two player game if desired.
B. It is possible to start a game in solitaire mode, save it, and then 
restart it as a two-player game. To do this set the main menu to two-player 
mode before beginning to restart the saved game.
C. It is possible to save a two-player game and restart it as a 
solitaire game when using the following restriction: All Japanese TFs must 
end the two player segment IN-PORT.
12.0  TWO-PLAYER GAMES
When using the two player format the following procedure should be 
observed.
A. While the U.S. player is giving commands to his forces the Japanese 
player should turn away or leave the room.
B. While the Japanese player is giving commands to his forces the U.S. 
player should turn away or leave the room.
C. During the combat resolution phase both players should view the 
results.

14.0  STRATEGY NOTES
FORMING TFs
1. Carrier TFs: All available carriers should be combined in one TF. 
Carrier TFs should include the best available Anti-aircraft ships in their 
screen. Some sample carrier TF screens are shown here:
USN: BB,CLAA,CLAA, DD, DD, DD, DD, DD, DD
IJN: CA, CA, CA, CA, DD, DD, DD, DDr DD, DD
When possible the IJN player should include CA - Tone and CA - Chikumawith 
his carriers to best utilize their enhanced search capabilities. At least 6 
DDs should be incIuded for Anti-sub Protection.
2. Fast Transport TFs: APD, DMS and Japanese DD units maybe used to 
rush supplies into Guadalcanal insmall quantities. The USN player should 
protect the APDs and DMSs with an equal number of DDs. The IJN player can 
load 6-8 DD's with cargo and plot an "FC" mission.
3. Transport TFs: 6 to 10 DDs should be included to screen the TRs. 
Transport missions should not be attempted without strong air cover. The IJN 
player should "level" Henderson field with Bombardments and have friendly 
carriers available to support a Transport mission. The USN player should have 
30 or more fighters on Henderson or have friendly carriers available to 
support a transport mission.
4. Bombardment TFs: The USN player should seldom risk his ships to 
bombard Cape Esperance. The IJN player should bombard Henderson Field as 
often as possible. A sample Bombardment force is shown here:
BB, BB, CA, CA, DD, DD, DD, DD, DD, DD
The IJN player has enough ships to "rotate" 3 battleship groups and 
continuously suppress Henderson Field. Battleships cause terrific damage when 
bombarding. Cruiser bombardments are only a nuisance.
5. Combat patrol TFs: The USN player MUST make an effort to block 
Japanese Battleship bombardment forces. A force of 3 to 6 crisers and 5 to 10 
destroyers peforming a "C" mission will usually cause a bombardment force to 
abort its misssion. CLAA ships should not be used in this role and 
Battleships should only be used when no CLs or CAs are available.
6. Submarine TFs: Submarine forces should contain 6 to 60 subs. The 15 
knot subs should not be combined in the same TF as 10 knot subs. USN subs 
usually find their best "hunting" when stationed in the slot SE of 
Shortlands. IJN sub usually do best in the waters SE of Guadalcanal.
AIR OPERATIONS
1. Normal CAP: Normal CAP provides the best protection for the "home" 
TF or base but no protection for other TFs or bases in the area. Normal CAP 
should be flown over Henderson Field when there are no friendly transport 
groups "unloadin" at Guadalcanal. Carriers should be protected by normal CAP 
whenever contact with enemy carriers is expected.
2. Long Range CAP: Longe Ragne CAP provides protection for friendly 
units up to 5 spaces away from the launching base/CV. Long Range CAP is best 
used to protect Transport and Bombardment groups that are within range of 
enemy land-based aircraft.
3. Search: Air Search is useful for providing and advance warning of 
approaching enemy fleets and designating targets for airstrikes. Whenever 
possible, each base should launch 6 to 12 bombers to supplement its search 
Planes.
4. Sub Search: A successful sub search is a powerful deterrent against 
sub attacks. "sighted" subs have reduced attack effectiveness and are open to 
attack from enemy bombers. Henderson Field should use 20 to 30 bombers on 
sub-search on turns when the IJN surface fleet is out of range. Carrier TFs 
should use a strong sub-search whenever contact with enemy carriers seems 
unlikely. Bombers should never be wasted on sub-search when a carrier vs. 
carrier battle seems likely.
5. Air Strikes: Carrier vs. Carrier combat is critical and often 
decisive. Carrier air groups should not be frittered away on secondary 
targets when an engagement with enemy carriers seems probable within a couple 
of days. Carrier aircraft should never be used to "soften up" Henderson Field 
- it's too expensive and the results are usually disappointing. Rabaul based 
aircraft should attack Henderson Field only if there are 40 or more Bettys 
available OR if you expect that supplies are critically low on Henderson 
Field. Henderson Field Bombers should attack at every opportunity to inflict 
damage on enemy ships.
6. Counterstrikes: Counterstrikes allow you to counterattack following 
airstrikes from unsighted enemy carriers. U.S.N. carriers may use 
counterstrikes without penalty (except in the Coral Sea Scenario). IJN 
carriers prepare counterstrikes at the riskof having their armed and fueled 
aircraft explode on deck following enemy bomb or torpedo hits.
7. Aircraft Transfers: Carriers with 10 to 25 percent damage should 
transfer their aircraft before docking. USN carriers can transfer their air 
groups to reinforce Henderson Field. Henderson Field should transfer all its 
aircraft to Espirtu 5anto when supplies fall below 3 and resupply is not 
immediate.
