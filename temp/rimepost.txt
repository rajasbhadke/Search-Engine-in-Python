NAME:         FAMILY/FRIENDS OF INCARCERATED (FFIncar)
NUMBER:       431
DESCRIPTION:  As crime increases more and more prisons are being built
              to house inmates who were previously allowed probation.
              Estimates run as high as one out of every three persons
              becoming involved with the penal system in some way
              *other* than as inmate.   Friends and family members,
              wishing to be of support to the person going through
              the criminal justice system, get caught up in its
              procedures; they are thrown into the world of penology
              by just VISITING, which can sometimes be mortifying,
              embarrassing or cruel. 
              This will be a support conference to compare notes, to tell
              of experiences (good or bad), to share the special
              anxieties of this unique but increasingly common bond.
              No one has to reveal who "their inmate" is, or the
              relationship.  That's not important here.  And OUTING
              (revealing who ANOTHER's inmate is) is completely
              forbidden; this is nobody's business.   What is important is
              that each participant come away with the knowledge that
              they are not alone in what they are experiencing.
