From the Jason Scott / TEXTFILES.COM Printout Collection

These are original linefeed printouts fed through a Optical Character
Recognition system, with hand-editing done afterwards to clean issues
with text rearrangement and OCR errors. 

The printouts are from a collection dating from 1983-1985, and were
generally made on an Epson MX-80 Dot-Matrix printer connected to an
IBM PC-XT. The Bulletin Board Systems and other services were located
throughout the United States, and captured by Jason Scott, who can
attest to their authenticity.

Spelling errors, content and extraneous system information such as 
prompts and menu items have been left untouched. Errors and other 
artifacts of conversion to this format should be considered in 
determining the validity or historical context of statements in these
printouts.

Like wow, I answered the trivia questio n correctly and now I have all the time
in the word to post.  I will do whatever I want.  I haven't posted in a long 
time here except for this insult that I put as a user bulletin that originally 
went to the sysop of metronet. But the main reason I haven't posted Is because 
I dont have much to say most of the time. gotta fix that. I want you all to
know that I buffer messages and will edit them and send them as g files later. 
ha ha ha ha. I have phucked with the boces system before. I reprogrammed the 
GIS program on my schools password to say FUCK YOU whem you ran it. Must have 
scared some student shitless. I have al so been tapping into fone lines with 
my trusty testing fone that I ripped off a ma bell repair van. I break into 
conversations and say "This is AT&T. You are no longer a preferred customer on 
we are going to cut off service, muther fucker!" Scared them shitless too. 
Need A visa or mastercard # to buy a new computer. will trade. Send E-MAIL

MSG TO    ALL GNARLBRAINS]

I WAS DOING SOME EXCHANGE SCANNING FOR MY LOCAL EXCHANGE AND FOUND THIS WEIRD 
OCCRENCE.

WHEN I DIALED 964-9938 I GOT SILENCE. IT DIDN'T DIAL OR ANYTHING. WHEN I 
REPLACED THE '38' WITH A '37' OR A '39', SAME THING HAPPENEDD.

WHEN I CHANGED THE EXCHANGE FROM 964 TO 852,968,971,963,985,983,979. I GOT
SILENCE, NO DIAL TONE, NOTHING.

FINALLY, WHEN I CHANGED THE EXCHANGE TO 960 I GOT SOMETHING. THE NUMBER THUS 
WAS 960-9938. DIALING THIS NUMBER GETS YOU A HIGH PITCHED TONE. IT WASN'T A 
CARRIER, THOUGH. ANY IDEAS?

here is a great way to start up alliance teleconfernces that I got off of 
Cathy's Clubhouse (it has some good phreak stuff on sub bd #2600).

here is what you will do:

dial 1-609-654-0270 theu an x10der. at the DIAL TONE, dial: 1234 then dial:
91 you will get a "street" dial tone, so you will dial: 0-700-456-1000 and you
will get an Alliance Teleconference, and you won't even be billed for it!!@!

Thanx to Cathy Bill for that one!!
