              A Song for the Holidays

        DUMP THE BOSSES OFF YOUR BACK
      from the Little Red Songbook of the IWW
      (Tune:  Take it to the Lord in Prayer)
        by John Brill, 1916


Are you cold for-lorn and hun-gry?  Are there lots of things you
lack?  Is your life made up of mis-'ry?  Then
dump the bos-ses off your back!  Are your clothes all torn and
tat-tered?  Are you liv-ing in a shack?  Would you have your trou-bles
scat-tered?  then dump the bos-ses off your back!


Are you almost split asunder?
Loaded like a long-eared jack?
Boob--why don't you buck like thunder,
And dump the bosses off your back?
All the agonies you suffer
You can end with one good whack--
Stiffen up, you orn'ry duffer--
And dump the bosses off your back.
