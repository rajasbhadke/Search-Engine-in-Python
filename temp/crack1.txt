  THE SUBJECT OF SOFTWARE PIRACY HAS BEEN AN OPEN TOPIC OF DISCUSSION ON THE   
BOARD FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER A PERSON CAME ON OUR 
BOARD WHO CALLED HIMSELF ROBBING HOOD, WHO SAID HE LIVED AT RISLEY HALL AT 
CORNELL, WAS A SOPHOMORE AND ALSO HIS REAL NAME WAS FRED WILLIAMS. IN EARLY 
DECEMBER I FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS REALLY SOMEONE FROM THE COMPANY CALLED SIRTECH
WHICH PRODUCES A GAME CALLED CALLED WIZARDRY. SOMETIME IN JANUARY HE FOUND OUT 
THAT WE KNEW WHO HE WAS AND AFTER SOME DISCUSSION DECIDED TO 'COME CLEAN'. I 
TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD TELL HIS STORY AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION
OF THE SUBJECT. COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY MANY USERS, AUTHORS, ATTORNEYS, 
PIRATES AND CRACKERS. THE ONGOING DIALOGUE IS GIVEN IN THE FOLLOWING VOLUMES OF
THE SUBJECT.
