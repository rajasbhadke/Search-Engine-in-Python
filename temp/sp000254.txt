This is sort of a seed issue of the journal, since it is the 
first, there is an obvious shortage in reader/activist 
response, the type of response Resist is built around.  As a 
result, to give a feel for what we are, and what were doing, 
this issue contains all of the Resist material to date, as 
well as some material from ToR #3, a zine which is fading out 
and still has some cool materials and submissions which were 
going to be, but never were printed in #3.  Therefore, this is 
actually a conglomerate of half Resist and half ToR, future 
issues will have only Resist stuff in them...  We hope you 
enjoy this issue, and more so that regardless of if you agree 
with us or not, you write to us and tell us your thoughts.  
This concept of hardcopy exchange of views and ideas allows 
for some 'unheard' concepts to come to light...

A Short Explanation of the Resist project
(And a request for submissions)
#########################################
by Sluggo and Mr. Hands
 
'Resist' is a special 
project being funded and published by NoHoD Pub Co.
 
The original concept of Resist is to create a (hardcopy) 
exchange of information, enlightenment, and revelation.  Not 
only do we distribute our own material, but we also hope 
that readers of Resist will send in their writings, essays, 
revelations, idea, and anything important and 
'changing'.  These things can range from carefully written 
essays to late-night revelations scrawled on scratch paper.  
These 'submissions' (not really submissions, we except 
EVERYTHING, no screening at all) will be compiled and 
published thru Resist.  We do write our own stuff, on a very 
wide variety of topics, but if !only! we did the writing, then 
Resist would become very one-sided.  If you disagree with 
something said in something we publish, by all means, write a 
response...
 
Therefore we encourage you to send every revelation, every 
thought you have to us, and we will do our best to show it to 
everyone else.  Stuff (of any sort... writings, music, art) can 
be sent to:
 
Resist
POBox 5356
Louisville, KY
40205
 
and writings and rants (essays... etc.) can be sent to 
hydra@delphi.com on the internet (email).  Do not be afraid to 
send your work, because you feel it is too unrefined, or too 
odd, we strive on odd revelations and new ideas (chains of 
thought).  Stuff can be sent formatted (Laid out on a ready 
to photocopy page) or unformatted (we will lay it out for 
you).  And once again everything will be re sent.  
 
By now you are probably wondering how to receive the writings, 
propaganda, etc...  To get a reply of some sort, and as much 
propaganda as we can fit send as many SASEs as you can, or as 
many stamps as you can to:
 
Resist
POBox 5356
Louisville, KY
40205
 
We will try to keep track of who has gotten what, so if you 
join us late we will pack all the old stuff together and send 
it.  Once again, please send your thoughts, this is what 
drives us.
 
Once every so often, depending on the flow of things, all of 
the Resist writings will be compiled in an issue of Modus 
Operandi, and produced in a zine-like form.  This is an 
easier way to collect the Resist writings, although it is not 
quite as interactive as a mail exchange.  We will keep both in 
equal running.
 
** Also, check for Resist stuff at the UWI ftp site,      **
** 141.214.4.135 /docs/nohod or write to hydra@delphi.com **
** to find out about getting resist stuff via e-mail      **
** and usenet.                                            **
                                     
** Now look for resist material at the Spunk Press location[s] 
too **

  As long as there is culture, there will always be a subculture. 
As long as there are heroes, there will be antiheroes. As long 
as there is logic, someone will be there to explode it all to hell.
 
  The best we can do is educate ourselves and then keep it to 
ourselves. Hide: and construct cabals of informed rebellion. 
The world's governments are rich with propaganda - it is our duty
to subvert with specifics, an agenda, and a vision.
 
  Once the undergrounds are established, the world above will become
jealous of our freedom and try to overcome us. Instead of constantly
retreating, we should form coalitions to make a statement. Scare with
information. Strike with the bizarre and create our own reality.
 
  Once the inevitable is realized, and the underground is revealed, 
like the spacey aliens of the imagination, we mutuate. Confuse and
disappoint. Find friends within the discontent and command the future
with metamorphoses.
 
Then hide.  We'll keep it to ourselves.
 
And never listen to a label. "Cyberpunk" is dead.
Long live the next wave.

You spend too much time on your artificial things, you waste to 
much time making money, you take too much time spending 
money.  You never stop to question why you do the things you 
do, you don't ask yourself why, you don't attempt to find the 
truth.  Your life is spent first learning to earn money, then 
working to gain money, spending the money, and then death.  
 
Never even had a point....
 
Why live life if you do not attempt to understand it.  The 
black box of existence is not meant to be used and taken for 
granted, it is meant to be opened, viewed, torn apart, 
scrambled, demolished, destroyed, examined, and reassembled.  
Too many fools, rich and poor, live life trying to be happy, 
without every stopping to try and figure out how they can be 
happy.  You must stop everything your doing, it is never too 
late.  The fool's life ends, and what did they gain?  Material 
possessions, only to be passed onto others, and what does s/he
take with him? nothing... not much at least.  Regardless of 
your religion, regardless of what you believe, it is 
imperative that nothing be taken for granted, everything must 
be examined [not all things, all things individual... your 
beliefs, morals, attitudes, emotions, etc...]
 
You must not fall into the trap of undirected movement, you 
must not strive for a goal laid down for you by society, or 
one laid down by anyone but yourself...

        All they want is control, total control.  They have no concern
for our msafety, what is our safety to them.  The only reason anything
is made illegal is to satisfy the people, or to protect the government,
but never just for our safety.
        You think that you can hide by getting your social security number
revoked, or by not getting a credit card.  You could go thru tons of
painstaking measures to evade the government, but it doesn't matter.  They
will always be able to find you, and if you let them, they will always be
able to control you.  They have their powerful armies of soldiers armed
with assault rifles, and their police squads in every single state.  These
are their tools to keep you in fear, scared and quiet.  You say that the
easiest thing to do is to just keep your silence, obey laws, and go about
your life.  "Then they won't bother you" you say.  But they still have
control.  "I am an individual", you say.  How can you be an individual when
you are just another one of their puppets, doing as they say, obeying them
like a dog.
        You say that anarchy wouldn't work, that its pointless, just afew
stupid kids trying to be different.  Anarchy is a cry for freedom.  "But we
already have freedom.  We're in America, land of the free!" you say.  We are
not free, the freedom is in your minds.  It's there because they have put it
there.  What better way to have total power than to lead you into believing
that you are free.  You are never free.  They have created a system in which
most of the people who support their government by working hard to pay taxes
and obeying laws, live a happy comfortable life,  and those who don't havn't
got enough say-so to change anything, for they are the poor, the lower class.
Why listen to them as long as the systems works for you?  So go on with your
comfortable lives, but no matter what they tell you, you are not free!  You
are never free!  Every minute that you don't speak out or do something to
stop them, they gain more and more control over you.  We need no
justification for anarchy, for we only want our freedom, not the bullshit
that they feed you, but real freedom.
        Join us now before you are caught in a crumbling system of 
government and authority.  Otherwise, you can go on thinking that
everything is fine, while they control your mind and lives.
The choice is yours.

An Interview with Operation Mindfuck
(originally to Appear in ToR #3) ###
####################################
 
ToR interviewed Jason Corley, 'head' of Operation Mindfuck, 
here goes...
 
Temple of Reason:  What is a mindfuck?
 
Jason Corley:  Operation Mindfuck was first described by Robert Anton
Wilson in his underground classic _The Illuminatus! Trilogy_.  In it's
simplest form, OM is civilian psychological warfare.  He describes
it much better than I ever could, but I'll give it my best shot.
 
There are certain people in the world that really deserve worse than
they are getting.  That is, they are prejudiced against new ideas,
good ideas, or both.  Often, these people are in a position to
affect many, many lives.  In George Hayduke's "Revenge" series
(as I like to call them), the attacks on these people are personal
and direct.  There is often no doubt as to the intention of the
attacker, though their identity may remain secret.
 
To the person involved in OM, this defeats the entire purpose
of attempting to get through to someone.  Think about it: if you
were (are?) an asshole, would you change your ways or your mind
just because someone left a bunch of health hazard signs spread
around and bullion cubes jammed into the faucets?  No.  Once
you figured out the joke, you would put it out of your mind... _or
become a bigger asshole_.
 
This is not the purpose of Operation Mindfuck.  OM is directed
at changing mental states by introducing confusing and downright
eerie stimuli.  The chosen vehicle for these stimuli is usually the Postal
Service.
 
Once the stimuli have begun, the subject will progress through
stages of strained amusement, nervousness, paranoia, anger and
frustration, and that can't be all bad, can it?
 
 
ToR:  Why did you start this project (operation)?
 
JC:  I first tried the Mindfuck on a local scholarship organization
that had passed over several friends of mine because of the
color of their skin.  My friends took this lightly, but I did not.
There was no appeal process to go through, so our hands were tied.
Operation Mindfuck was the only choice, and we did it for eight
months, seriously shaking up several who worked at the offices
of the organization and having good, cathartic fun the whole time.
 
ToR:  What is your MO (modus operandi)?
 
JC:  The usual method by which the Mindfuck works is this:
 
First, select your target.  (We'll call him Skippy.)  Do this
carefully.  People high up in government such as Congress and
the President make poor targets.  They receive so much confusing
stimuli from _real crackpots_ that yours will be lost in the
shuffle.
 
Second, establish connections with people "in" other postmarks.
Nothing will blow an OM faster than a lot of identical postmarks
on letters.  This is where electronic mail becomes extremely useful,
because it can connect people in other states and other countries
very quickly.
 
Third, create spurious organizations who will send information,
requests and other messages to the target.  There are several
sorts of fictional organizations you can make:
        1. Silly and hostile.  "We of the Traffic Engineers Union Local
#667 demand that you equitably treat the traffic engineers in your
organization or be faced with ten-minute red lights at every
intersection on your drive home.  We are serious about this."
        2. Scary and friendly.  "The American White People's Party
salutes you for your diligence and efforts to maintain the god-
given white male position in our society.  You are now a Grand
High Poobah."
        3. Silly and friendly.  "Do you want to make more money?
Sure, we all do!  That's why the International Counterfeiter's
School is offering seminars for you and your executives, totally
free of charge.  If you are interested, call..."
        4. Eerie.  "Please, you've got to help me.  You're my
last hope.  Do you remember that night in (insert suburb or
nearby town here)?  I mean it, I need to talk to you right away.
You know where to find me."
        5. Incomprehensible.  "The rat flies at midnight, captain.
Talk to Spaldoni, he and flatfoot are eating out in the garden."
 
Fourth, write the letters, with your people in the other states.
If they don't have the time or the inclination, just send _them_
the letter so that they can get the postmark.
 
That's it.  From there on out, just keep up the proliferation of
organizations and people as long as you can.
 
ToR:  How coordinated is your operation, is there a established
group of people who take part in your OM?
 
JC:  Each OM is different.  Several of my friends in different
states have assisted me in the past.  Any creative person
is a valuable addition to the OM team.  What's more,
it's fun, so even people who haven't been directly offended
by the target can still have fun spreading a little truth.
 
ToR:  How frequently is their a call for Operation Mindfuck?
 
JC:  Sad to say, today's world is chock full of targets.  As I said
before, though, the best OMs are local.  Find that special
someone who has insulted, ruined, or displayed incredible stupidity,
they may live up your street or around the world, and do it.
And if one of your friends helping you finds a target in _his_
neighborhood, you should pitch in and lend a hand.  Sounds like a
citizenship film from 5th grade gone horribly awry.
 
 
ToR:  How widespread is your project (i.e. regional, national,
global, etc..)?
 
JC:  By it's nature, the OM needs to be in more than one zip code.
In a practical sense, this means that people from all over the
world can concentrate their efforts on one target.  Whether
you would classify this as a regional project (since only
one target at a time is selected) or a global project
(since the letters come from all over the world), I don't know.
 
ToR:  If someone has a target in mind, but lacks participants in 
other areas, can they contact you for help in their OM?
 
JC:  Yes, of course, though I can't say how soon I'll get back to them.
I prefer email contact: corleyj@gas.uug.arizona.edu should do it.
 
You would be surprised how many potential participants there are
out there, though.  I would say that anyone with any friends at
all shouldn't have too many problems.
  
ToR:  How devoted are you to Discordianism?  Do you have any interest
in more modern pseudocultreligions (such as Subgenius, Kibology, HToMc,
etc)?
 
JC:  Hah!  Discordianism is the tool of Satan!  I spit on Kibology THUS
pthooi!  The High Temple of Mass Consumption is a convocation of
liars and lunatics!  Follow the one True Truth and that is all
you will need.  If you think I'm going to tell you what it is,
you're sorely mistaken.
 
ToR:  Any closing comments?
 
JC:  Yes: In the immortal words of Tom Stoppard: "Things have gone
about as far as they can possibly go when things have gotten
about as bad as they can reasonably get."  Know when to stop.
Ideally, you should build the tension and paranoia of the
letters to a fever pitch, perhaps sending two or three a day
(from different zip codes, again.)  And then, suddenly stop.
Clean out the stationery files on your computer, delete
all the records, and stop buying stamps.  It never happened.
 
This will leave them available to be another target, months
or years later.

TV'S REAL GAME
##############
by Phineas Narco
 
[appropriated from the Internet, where this originally 
appeared, and is used with permission of the author. ]
 
        The recent earthquake media feeding frenzy points out 
something you'll find in almost all media... an almost 
universal focus on drama, tragedy, sex and bad news.  
Everyone complains about too much sex & violence on TV (well 
almost everyone, there seem to be no groups calling for MORE 
sex & violence anyway) and yet the most violent (and sexy) 
shows are the ones that get the highest ratings.  People 
seem to generally like this stuff, otherwise there wouldn't 
be so much of it.  The fascination with tragedy (especially
someone ELSE'S tragedy) certainly is nothing new.  Even back 
in ancient Greece some of the most popular theater (an 
ancient equivalent of television) were tragedies like 
Oedipus Rex.  We seem to have always liked and been 
fascinated by bad news.  
        I think boredom is another reason we like it.  Bad news 
is exciting cuz we can vicariously experience, through 
television, great tragedies and disasters without having to 
actually go through them.  Most of the tragic stories that 
bombard us from television don't happen to most people.  We 
wouldn't really want them to happen to us but we can derive 
the 'benefit' of being vicariously excited by the stories.  
'Reality' for most of us consists of going to work, leisure 
time, sleeping and eating.  'Reality' as television presents 
it, is a very dangerous, disturbing, exciting, and drama-
filled world.  Studies have shown that people who watch a 
lot of TV generally think the world is a much more dangerous 
place than people who do not watch TV (or watch it less).  
>From talking to people in general I get the impression that 
most people are bored and unsatisfied with their jobs (they 
can't really pick and choose too much for them, they take 
what they can get) and television helps them to create the 
illusion that the world (read:  their life) is more 
dangerous (read: exciting) than it is.  Most people, after 
getting home from a boring, unsatisfying,  and/or demeaning 
job will immediately turn on the television to 'unwind' in 
front of it.  Why else (other than the fact that it 
mesmerizes, titillate and excites us) would someone want to 
present the world this way to us?
     The answer, or at least one the answers, is money.  
Television is a money making machine.  Just about everyone 
on there is being paid money to say what they're saying.  
All programming is presented so that commercials (or 
donation acknowledgements) can be shown along with them.  
Generally speaking, you have a lot of programming that 
presents a dreadful world full of fear and horror and every 
so often they break from this for commercials that promise a 
relief from dread (such as sexual frustration, social or 
physical insecurity, class envy) *IF* YOU BUY... <fill in 
the blank>.  
        This is the same reason you get so many anti-sex 
sentiments expressed by the religious right and 'moralistic' 
politicians.  Think about how you've felt right after you've 
had really good sex.  You feel happy, satisfied and content.  
You certainly don't want to run right out and buy something 
do you?  If you can sexually frustrate people by putting out 
the message that 'sex is dirty except sometimes for the 
purpose of procreation' and simultaneously titillate them 
with erotic imagery (just turn on MTV, or any other 
countless programs, anytime for an example) then these same 
people will be much more susceptible to advertising 
campaigns that promise sexual satisfaction as a consequence 
of buying... <fill in the blank>.  And all you have to do is 
open a magazine or turn on the television and you'll find 
endless ads from ad campaigns that are designed this way.  A 
sexually frustrated population is a population of eager 
consumers.  
 
        I think this is TV's real game.  Question is, people: 
how long are we gonna play it?

On December 31, known cyberspace rights advocate, EFF member and 
author of "Zen and the Art of the Internet", Brendan Kehoe, was involved in 
a car accident. This accident almost cost him his life, and even now he is 
unconscious and will be crippled for life.
 
        The "accident" is no coincidence. This was an attempt on Kehoe's
life. Earlier that day, a CIA "black operations" squad tampered with his
car severing the brake lines. The assassination attempt was sanctioned by
the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the
National Reconnaissance Organization. Kehoe was a thorn in the side of these
powerful interests, because he was a senior figure in the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation. The EFF has opposed the US Government/International Media 
Corporations attempts to restrict cyberspace, bring the flow of information
under central CFR/Bilderberg/Trilateral/MJ-12 bolshevik control and to
abolish privacy on the network.
 
        Now that Kehoe has been neutralized, the assassins will be going
after his successor and other advocates of individual freedom and net
privacy. NOBODY IS SAFE UNTIL THEY SUCCEED IN MAKING THE INTERNET A POLICE
STATE. ONE  NET UNDER SURVEILLANCE, WITH MAIL INTERCEPTS AND  WIRETAPS FOR
