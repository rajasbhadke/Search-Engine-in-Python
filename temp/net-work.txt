  IN THIS TUTORIAL, I HOPE TO TEACH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT THE NET-WORKS PROGRAM,
AND HOW TO DESTROY ANY NW BOARD YOU MIGHT HAPPEN TO HATE.

  NICK NAIMO (THE AUTHOR OF NW) LEFT QUITE A FEW BUGS IN HIS PROGRAM, MAYBE ON
PURPOSE...  WHO KNOWS?	HERE ARE A FEW OF THEM.

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
    HOW TO MILDLY ANNOY THE SYSOP
=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

  TYPE 'G' AT THE MAIN MENU PROMPT.  WHEN IT ASKS YOU FOR A NUMBER, ENTER A
VALID NUMBER PLUS A DECIMAL...	FOR INSTANCE, 3.5.  THIS WILL CREATE A ONE
SECTOR FILE CALLED "J.3.5.SYS" WHICH WILL NEVER BE ERASED UNLESS THE SYSOP
HIMSELF CATALOGS THE DISK AND DELETES THEM ALL BY HAND.

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
HOW TO DESTROY (ALMOST) ANY SYSTEM FILE
=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

  TO DESTROY ALMOST ANY SYSTEM FILE, THERE MUST BE A BOARD SHARING DRIVE 1,
WHERE MOST OF THE SYSTEM FILES ARE KEPT.  POST A MESSAGE CALLED

USERS.SYS
TITLES OR TITLES1 OR TITLES.1
MENU.SYS

  WITH A SPACE IN FRONT OF IT...  FOR INSTANCE, TO DESTROY THE PASSWORD FILE,
POST A MESSAGE CALLED " USERS.SYS", THE SPACE IN THE FRONT IS LOST WHEN THE
FILE IS RE-READ, SO GO TO ANOTHER BOARD, AND THEN BACK TO THE BOARD YOU POSTED
ON.  THEN, REMOVE THE MESAGE YOU JUST POSTED...  IT WILL DELETE THE "USERS.SYS"
AND LEAVE " USERS.SYS" ALONE....  PRETTY COOL, EH?

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
     HOW TO GET INTO THE MONITOR
=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

  THIS IS THE BEST CRASH THERE IS, I THINK...  IF THE BOARD YOU ARE CRASHING
HAS NOT BEEN PROTECTED FROM IT, IT WILL ALWAYS A) HANG TOTALLY OR B) GO INTO
THE MONITOR.  WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS THIS:  TYPE 'E' AT THE MAIN MENU PROMPT,
AND THEN WHEN IT ASKS YOU FOR A NAME, ENTER GARBAGE....  OR A REAL NAME, IT
REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.  WHEN IT SAYS "50 LINES MAX., TO END TYPE --> /EX <--"
YOU DO THIS:

A) HIT <RETURN> ONCE.
B) TYPE /EX
C) TYPE 'F' AT THE CHOICES.
D) ENTER "99E99" FOR THE LINE NUMBER TO FIX.
E) GOTO STEP A WHEN IT SAYS 50 LINES...  AGAIN.

  AFTER ABOUT 6-10 TIMES OF THIS, YOU WILL HEAR A BEEP AS IT GOES INTO THE
MONITOR....  IF CONTROL-C WORKS, THEN YOU'RE INTO BASIC!  IF IT DOESN'T, THEN
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE SYSOP TO COME ALONG AND HIT RESET AND RE-RUN
HIS BOARD.

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
   WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET INTO BASIC
=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

  IF YOU GET INTO BASIC, THEN CHECK TO SEE IF THE SYSOP HAS HIS PROGRAM SAVED
ON HIS DISK.  IF HE DOES, THEN MAKE A FEW 'BACKDOORS' SO YOU CAN GET INTO BASIC
ANYTIME YOU WANT TO, AND THEN SAVE IT ONTO HIS DISK...	THEN TYPE RUN.	YOU'LL
LOSE CARRIER, AND HE'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT HIT HIM WHEN SUDDENLY HIS PASSWORD FILE
GETS DELETED EVERY NIGHT!

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
	     SYSOP ACCESS
=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

  ANOTHER USEFUL THING TO KNOW IS IF YOU ENTER A SYSOP PASSWORD, EVEN IF IT'S
WRONG, YOU CAN GET VERY HIGH ACCESS.  FOR INSTANCE LET'S SAY YOU LOG ON AND SEE
THE NORMAL LOG ON...

CONNECTED TO:  JOE'S BBS

ENTER ACCOUNT NUMBER OR THE WORD 'NEW'.

--->

  AT THAT POINT, YOU SHOULD ENTER SOME- THING LIKE:  E1EL (THAT IS A COMMON
SYSOP PASSWORD).  WHEN IT SAYS "INVALID PASSWORD" YOU SHOULD TYPE THE WORD
"NEW".  ENTER WHATEVER YOU WANT FOR THE NAME, AND WHEN IT ASKS YOU FOR A PHONE,
JUST HIT <RETURN>...  IT WON'T ASSAIGN A PASS- WORD, BUT WHO CARES.  WHEN YOU
GET INTO THE BBS, TYPE "Y".  YOU SHOULD EITHER HAVE A LEVEL OF 9 OR SPECIAL
DOWNLOAD ACCESS (ON T-I-M-E-C-O-R YOU GET SPECIAL DOWNLOAD ACCESS).  THE ONLY
PROBLEM IS THAT YOU ARE NOT VALIDATED...  IF THE SYSOP IS STUPID ENOUGH, HE MAY
VALIDATE YOU IF YOU CHAT SO YOU CAN JUST "LOOK AROUND".  THE MAIN USE FOR THIS
IDEA IS TO LOOK AT A HIGH LEVEL "G" SECTION YOU DON'T NEED TO BE VALIDATED TO
LOOK AT.

  NOTE:  ON BOARDS REQUIRING ACCOUNT NUMBERS, YOU SHOULD ENTER 1 AS THE ACCOUNT
	 NUMBER.

  P.S.	BE CAREFUL HOW YOU DISTRIBUTE THIS, IF EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY GETS
	HOLD OF IT, EVERY BOARD WILL BE PROTECTED AND THIS TUTORIAL WILL BE
	USELESS...  KEEP THAT IN MIND, AND HAVE PHUN!!!
