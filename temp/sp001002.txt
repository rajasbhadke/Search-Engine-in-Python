ON THE AIR (A) IN BRAZIL

Curitiba is the capital of the state of Parana,
in the south of Brazil, located at about 350
kms. to the South East of Sao Paulo with a
population of about one and a half million
and is thus the tenth largest city in
population terms in the country. There they
are living through a pioneering experience
for the Brazilian and Latin American
libertarian movement: the setting up of an
anarchist radio transmitor. It's called 'FM
107,9 Burro Brabo, Radio Libre Pirataria'
which came on air in the first half of 1995.

The launching and running of this iniciative
was taken care of by groups who have been
active in the area  for some time:
GR.A.VID.A (Direct Action Anarchist
Group and editors of the information sheet
DIRECT ACTION) and the collective of the
paper JORNAL DO BACACHERI. With an
effort which can only be described as
extraordinary, given the difficulties which
will always attend such a project in Latin
America, they managed to concretise the
idea and began to transmit music, protest,
humour, poetry and anarchism to  the
listeners in some areas of the city.

In correspondence we received in June these
enthusiastic friends tell us that shortly they
will be able to cover the whole of Curitiba
along with it's outskirts thanks to a new
aerial they have bought, this was an on-
going situation. They also sent us a call so
that sympathetic people from all over the
world send them support: publications, taped
music, poetry, info, suggestions and of
course any other form of help (if possible
economic). Since everything which arrives is
welcome and indespensable so that these
radical Don Quijotes can continue with their
marvellous project on their 'Burro Brabo'
