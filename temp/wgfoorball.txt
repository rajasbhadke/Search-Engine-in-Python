* Introduction *

It's late in the fourth quarter.  Third down and five yards to go.  The ball
is snapped.  The quarterback fakes a handoff and sneaks into the end zone to
tie the game.  The crowd goes wild!

THE WORLD'S GREATEST FOOTBALL GAME puts you on the field and on the sideline
as both player and coach of a football team.  The most true-to-life football
game ever created, THE WORLD'S GREATEST FOOTBALL GAME emphasizes strategy,
play design, and physical contact.  There are 22 players on the field, each
programmed with real football logic and reasoning.

All right, Coach, you call the plays.  Roll out the CHALKBOARD and design
just the play you need to outmaneuver the other team.  At the CHALKBOARD you
can design a whole new offensive game plan-unbeatable formations and elaborate
passing patterns that require skill and finesse.

THE WORLD'S GREATEST FOOTBALL GAME is just like being on the line of scrimmage.
The opposing team promises to tear you apart with a fearsome defensive
strategy; a defense that will stick to you like glue.  They'll break up the
pass and force the big turnover.  Watch out for an interception!

THE WORLD'S GREATEST FOOTBALL GAME is the most realistic football game to come
home to your computer.  From the roar of the crowd and the kick off, to the
thrill of the long gainer, THE WORLD'S GREATEST FOOTBALL GAME combines all the
elements and excitement of professional football.  Easy-to-follow menus direct
you through the game.  Play against the computer or against your friends.

So adjust your shoulder pads, the Kick-off is about to begin!.


* Getting Started *

For one player game play, you can use either the keyboard or the joystick.

between single and multi-screen views.

     <> Sideline View - On the right side of the screen is your original
                        sideline view.  It allows you to see both teams at the
                        line of scrimmage before and during the play.
     <> Overhead View - On the lower left side of the screen is the overhead
                        view of the entire field.  It allows you to survey all
                        22 players moving on the field, highlighting the key
                        offensive and defensiv payers and the position of the
                        ball.
     <> Overhead      - In the upper left corner of he screen is an overhead
        Close-up View   close-up view, with a + sign mrking the position of the
                        ball carrier, and the X's and O's marking the positions
                        of the offensive and defensive players in the immediate
                        area.  The close-up view allows you to view the action
                        from above, watch the offensive and defensive players
                        execute their routs, and t see the best "holes" to take
                        advantage of.

The quarterback is indicated with a green squae, the receiver will be indicated
by an orange square.  The ball is snappd, and the play begins.  Use your

* The Chalkboard *

It's been said that football is 85 percent mental and 15 percent physical.
And most of that mental work - designing and calling the right ply knowing who
to throw to and who to block - gets done in front of the CHALKBOARD.  That's
where you, as Coach, can put togethr your own Playbook with enough formations,
plays, and options to keep your opponent off balance.  Working with the
CHALKBOARD, you can design blocking and passing patterns for each play -
play's you'll be calling as part of your game plan.

Before you start designing your plays, study the illustrations provided in
the Playbook (no.. not typing tht one up).  You'll see a variety of offensive
and defensive formations and routes.

There are 87 possible offensive receiver routes, each identified by a # in the
lower left-hand corner.  The X and Y coordinates in each pattern represent the
forward and lateral movement of the player on the field with 0,0 being the
starting point of each receiver.  Thus, in a Square Out - Route 05, the
receiver runs straight out 10 yards, then cuts to his right 10 yards to catch
the ball.

Entering the CHALKBOARD from the PLAY GAME section is easy.  Select the EXIT
icon from the GAME OPTION menu to return to the Main Menu.  Using the joystick
(pressing the J or L key), select the DISK icon and press the FIRE button
(SPACE BAR).

This takes you to the SAVE/LOAD menu.  If you want to save the present game,
select SAVE GAME and the game will be saved.  Then you can go on to the
CHALKBOARD and eturn to the game after you have designed your plays.

Select the CHALKBOARD icon froom the SAVE/LOAD menu.  Press the FIRE button
(SPACE BAR).  Remove/ the disk from the disk drive, turn it over and insert
it with the SIDE 1 label facing up.

The CHALKBOARD menu is made up of six options.  These options are:

 (eye-icon) o views a play from the Play disk menu
 ('+'-icon) o to add/design a play
 (CNG-icon) o to change a play
 (can-icon) o to delete a play
 (disk-icon) o to intialize or format a blank disk to store your plays.
 (ball-icon) o return to PLAY GAME

Selecting any of the first four icons will prompt you to choose Offense (O's)
or Defense (X's).  Then you'll be asked to select Run, Pass, Field Goal, and
Punt.  Next choose Left, Right, and Middle.  The last screen is the Play Book.

* To View a Play *

To view saved plays, select the VIEW icon.  Select the play you want to view,
then pull the joystick DOWN (press the , key) to scroll down the list, push
the joystick UP (press the I key) to scroll up the list, and LEFT or RIGHT
(press the J and L keys) to move to the next column of plays.  Each play is
highlighted as you scroll past it.  Press the FIE button (SPACE BAR) to select
the play you want.

Note: If there are no plays available in a particular category you've selected,
      "NO PLAYS ON FILE" will appear at the top of the screen.  Select EXIT to
      return to the CHALKBOARD menu.

The play will then be diagrammed on your screen.  White lines, ending in a square represent the Primary receiver route and white lines ending in a
diamond represent the Secondary receiver route.  Orange lines represent the
routes of the other players.

If you have a printer, you can print out the diagram of the new plays you
design - or of the entire class of plays by selecting the print option you want.

EXIT o exit the print option
MONITOR o print the diagram

button (SPACE BAR).  Then select the appropriate options on each menu.

Note: It is recommended that each player save plays on separate disks.

Choosing Formations

You'll then be asked to choose an offensive formation.  Each of the 27 possible
formations is displayed, with formaton numbers in the lower left corner of the
screen.  To advance to the next formation, select the down-arrow and press the
FIRE button (SPACE BAR).  To go to the previous formations, select the
up-arrow.

When you are diagramming plays on the CHALKBOARD, the yardage lines on your
screen ae marked every 10 yards.

To see the preassigned routs for players in each formation, move the cursor
to the ROUTES x icon and press the FIRE button (SPACE BAR).

FIRE button (SPACE BAR).

Selecting Players

Once you've chosen a formatiom, you'll be asked to select the players you
want to assign a route to.  A circle will appear around a player in your
formation, and his position and number will be displayed in the lower corners
of the screen.  Use the up-arrow and down-arrow icons and press the FIRE button
(SPACE BAR) to move the circle up and down the formtion.

To select a player, set the circle aound the position within the formation.
Then move the cursor to the OK opton and prss the FIRE button (SPACE BAR).

Selecting Routes

Next you'll be asked to choose a Route for that player.  Use the up-arrow
and down-arrow icons and press the FIRE button (SPACE BAR) to flip through
87 possible receiver routes.  The screen display will tell you what formation
you're in, which player you're assigning a route to, ad the route number you're
currently selecting.

If you're assigning routes to a running back, and want to see how a cross
pattern, for example, Route 03, will integrate with the routes that the rest
of the team players will be running, select the ROUTES x icon and press the
FIRE button (SPACE BAR).  The running back's cross pattern will be highlighted
with a white line and all other offensive routs will be sown in orange lines.

If you want to reverse the displayed route, select the REVERSE icon (rvs).
The Route number of that pattern will be displayed in black lettering on
a white background on the botto right-hand side of the screen, until you
select the REVERSE icon (rvs) again.

When you're ready to assign a route to that player, move the cursor to
the EXIT icon and prss the FIRE button (SPACE BAR).

You'll then be asked to choose the next player you want to assign a route
to.  Repeat the process as above.

Note: To move ahead to the next menu, select OK.  Select EXIT to return to the
      previous menu.

You don't have to select a route for each player.  If you want to stay with
a player's preassigned route, just skip to the next player in the "Choose
Player" screen.

Primary and Secondary Player Selection

When you're satisfied with the route for each player, press the FIRE button
(SPACE BAR) to EXIT from the last "Choose Player" screen.  Repeat the EXIT
routine until you're asked to choose a primary ball carrier for offensive
plays.  Each eligible receiver in your formation will then be circled in turn,
and his route will be displayed.  Use the FIRE button (SPAE BAR) to select
a Primary receiver, move the cursor to OK, and press the FIRE button (SPACE
BAR).  The Primary receiver's route will then be highlighted in a dark line
ending in a black square.

You must then select a secondary receiver the same way.  His route will be
shown ending in a diamond.

Name a Play/Save a Play

Once you've selected a formation, routes and ball carriers, you need to name
the play.  Using the keyboard, enter the play name.  You can name your play
with any combination of letters and numbers up to 15 characters.  It's a good
idea to include information in the play name tha will cue you as to the nature
of the play.  For example, "F1 Trap Left RB" tells you the information you are
using (#1), the kind if play, and the Primary ball carrier or running back.
In a defensive play "322 MAN TO MAN" indicates three players stating one yard
off the line, and two players two yars off the line, with the rest of the
players in the backfield.

* To Change a Play *

The CHANGE icon on the CHALKBOARD menu allows you to change a play you've
already designed.  Select the play you want to change.

You'll then be asked whether ou want to Rename (NAME) or Redesign (REDO)
the play.  Press the FIRE button (SPACE BAR) and you'll see the play list
for that type of play.  Use the cursor to select the pay you want to change.

If you just want to Rename a play, you'll be given a screen to rename.  Now
you can SAVE the play as before.

If you want to Redesign the play, you'll go through the same sequence you
followed in the ADD play process - choosing a new formation, player routes
and ball carriers.  Remember that players will keep the same routes you
assigned them in your original play, unless you change a particular player's
route.  Save your play as before.

* Delete a Play *

The DELETE icon allows you to remove plays from the Playbook.  Flip through
the option menus to find the play you want to delete.  Press the FIRE button
(SPACE BAR goddammit) for your selection.  At the same time you delete a
play from the Playbook, you create space to add new plays.

When you're satisfied with the variety of plays you've designed on the
CHALKBOARD, it's time to suit up and return to the field.  To get from the
CHALKBOARD to the PLAY GAME, select the PLAY GAME icon from the CHALKBOARD
menu.  Tis will bring you to the ENTER TEAM NAME screen.  Using the keyboard,
enter your team name and press RETURN.  To cntinue on i PLAY GAME, follow
the instructons in the PRE-GAME section.

Note: At any time during the CHALKBOARD, you can press the RESET key to return
      to the main CHALKBOARD menu.

* Helpful Hints *

<> Moving the quarback before the ball is snapped will rsult in a fumble.
   Look for "Received Snap" at the top of the screen to start movement.
<> On running plays, you will hear a "tone" when the designated player is in
   position to take a hand-off.  For example, you can run a halfback option,
   with your halfback taking the handoff and passing to a receiver downfield.
<> When positioning a player to catch a pass or lateral, move them toward the
   shadow cast by the ball's relative position to the round.  Players must be
   within arm's reach of the ball to take the pass.
<> If the ball has not passed the line of scrmmae, players will stay at the
   endpoints of their routes.  Defensive players will revert to man-to-man
   coverage.
<> If you have not assigned a route to a defensie player, he'll play man-to-
   man.  Linemen will rush the quarterback, and backs will move towad the
   ball.
<> Offensive backs may have a hard time shaking man-to-man coverage.  One
   technique is t jiggle the joystick whn you're controlling the receiver.
<> Running backs positioned on the line become blockers if they're not
   handling the ball.
<> Each player is programmed with his own logic for his position.  For
   instance, a tight end may pick up the blitz and stay on the line to block,
   rather than run his route.
<> Running backs ae programmed with "the John Riggins factor" - the ability
   to overpower tacklers in the open field or at the line of scrimmage.
<> Quarterbacks are programmed with a "tiring factor" - if you try too many
   quarterback sneaks or end runs, he'll tire and become less effective.
<> Offensive and defensive backs are fast, but less effective blockes.
   Linemen are slow, but strong.
<> Plays can be altered by you on the field.  So, if you call a long, left
   passing play, and then ecide to run the ball up the middle, you can control
   the action.
<> Using the joystick (appropriate directional keyboard controls), movement
   is keyed to the sieline view of the game.  Moving the joystick LEFT or
   RIGHT (press the J or L key) will move your player left or right on the
   field.  If you're keying your moves to the overhead view of the field,
   rotate the joystick one quarter turn to the ight, so that player movement
   on the overhead screen corresponds to the movement of the joystick.
<> When selecting the direction of the Play type, remember that the direction
   is from each player's point of view on te field.  Left for you is right for
   the opposition.
