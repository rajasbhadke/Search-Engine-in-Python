       This  listing of  Astro/Space BBS's  is updated  quarterly.   The
       latest list can always be obtained by Freq, or by calling the BBS
       listed below.  You can support this directory by contributing BBS
       information for boards that actively support  Astronomy and Space
       formats.  All boards are  called before they are included in this
       directory to ensure the integrity of the listings.

       If you wish to add your favorite Astronomy/Space BBS to this list
       or update a listing already present, you may do so by sending the
       information to  StarBase III - BBS  via FidoNet address  1:205/33
       or  by calling  StarBase III - BBS  at   1-209-432-2487.   Please
       send the information in the format that you see here in the list.
       Or... you can call StarBase III and answer the questionnaire from
       the Main Menu to have your BBS included!

       About The Filename:  The filename,  for example,  AS914.TXT, lets
       you know if you have the  latest edition  of the  Astronomy/Space
       BBS Directory.  The AS stands for  Astronomy/Space, the following
       two numbers indicate  the year - in this case 1991 - and the last
       number indicates the quarter  for which the directory is current.
       In this example,  AS914.TXT, the directory is current for the 4th
       quarter of 1991.           Thank you, and clear skies to you all!
