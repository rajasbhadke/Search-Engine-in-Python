                                  Asylum (Screenplay)
                                  -------------------

The game in itself isn’t all that difficult. Admittedly, all the puzzles without exception seem to have 
been thrown in at random, and quite a lot of them defy any kind of logic. The game doesn’t make 
the least attempt to develop a story, either. But if you want to beat it, here goes...

Oh yeah, one more thing – all objects come in boxes. Weird.

                                                                  --- Part 1 ---
MAP 1
(1) - You begin in your cell. For some odd reason someone has chosen to leave behind a CREDIT 
CARD which gives you access to most rooms on MAP 1. Nice guards, I’ll give them that :-)
Take the card.
(3) – The inmate here will give you a hint on how to escape: wear a doctor’s coat.

Now, go through the door leading to MAP 2 then return to point A on MAP 1 and pick up the 
GOLD CARD, which has appeared here.
(2) – pick up the ROCKET BELT.
(4), (5), (7) and (8) - Pick up the BIRD COSTUME, BEAN BAG, STETHOSCOPE, and SILVER 
CARD, respectively.
Proceed to point G, DROP BEAN BAG, RUN to the other end of the hallway, turn around, WEAR 
BELT and PRESS BUTTON ON BELT. You’ll crash into the wall at the other end, producing 
some COPPER WIRE.
(6) Fuse Room – EXAMINE FUSE BOX then SCRAMBLE FUSE BOX. This has effect on Electro 
Therapy later on.
Sooner or later you’ll run into a seemingly sick inmate. Just GIVE STETHOSCOPE TO INMATE 
and try to KILL INMATE afterwards. This will leave you with some DRUGS.

Go and pick up the AXE at point B. At this point, a wall across the exit is being built (dotted line on 
MAP). Keep track of where you’re going now! Go back towards the exit and you’ll run into an 
ELECTRICIAN. Do _not_ look up, as he suggests. Instead, KILL INMATE WITH AXE and 
TAKE FUSE. Return to where the exit was and HACK WALL WITH AXE to get out!

Nearby, in area C, CLOSE DOOR and LOCK DOOR WITH SILVER CARD. Do this with all the 
doors. Hey, there are only a total of 20 (arrrgh! what an awful puzzle!) This will make the unseen 
character drop something nearby. Look behind all of the doors and you’ll eventually find some 
MATCHES and a CANDLE.

MAP 2:
(12) Surgery – If you’re carrying the drugs, the surgeon will alter your face. Now you’re looking 
like Alfred Hitchcock (???)
(14) Film set – Entering here, the producer – recognizing you as Mr. Hitchcock – gives you a 
CAMERA.
Wander around for a bit and a guard will show up and ask to be in your movie. Say YES twice and 
then GIVE BIRD COSTUME TO GUARD. Afterwards, take his UNIFORM (great puzzle :-)
(13) Therapy – once you enter here, the guards will try to give you shock therapy. If you’ve messed 
up the fuse box at (6), however, the fuses blow and you’re left with a BATTERY.
Now, LIGHT CANDLE WITH MATCHES.

MAP 1:
(6) Fuse Room - Simply INSERT FUSE IN FUSE BOX to turn the power back on.
(9) Phone Room – WEAR UNIFORM to prevent unwanted attention and then HACK PHONE 
WITH AXE and HACK RECEIVER WITH AXE to produce some COINS and a MAGNET. 
Remember to DROP UNIFORM and GET UNIFORM again, otherwise the “Outside room” 
descriptions vanish (for no apparent reason...)

MAP 2:
(11) Scientist – enter here with the MAGNET, BATTERY and COPPER WIRE, and the nice lady 
will give you a Time Stasis Unit, a.k.a. a GENERATOR (pretty strange that she doesn’t keep it for 
herself – ah, well...).
(10) Psychiatrist – Unless you prefer to be bored to death, PRESS BUTTON ON GENERATOR. 
This makes time pass at a tremendous rate. The shrink will depart, leaving his SMOCK behind. 
WEAR SMOCK then leave at the nearby exit to finish part 1! 

A guard appears to order you to stop the Master Mystic who is roaming the corridors of the asylum. 
You are given a PLATINUM CARD, which will grant you access to all rooms on maps 3, 4, and 5.
Afterwards, you are returned to your room.


                                                            --- Part 2 ---
Go to MAP 5 via MAP 2.
Go to point H and slip on the banana peel twice. A very peculiar lawyer appears and gives you a 
BOOK ON LAW. Also, EXAMINE PEEL to find a CATERPILLAR.
At point F, take the ROPE.
(24) – take the RAT SUIT.
Next, enter area D and pick up the KNIFE. This area is very difficult to MAP, so I have merely 
given the directions to get you in and out again.

MAP 3:
(18) Spiritual Master – GIVE BOOK TO GURU and in return you will receive a SCROLL, which 
you must use to end the game.
(17) Exterminator – when standing outside the room, TIPTOE, enter the room and TIE 
EXTERMINATOR WITH ROPE. This prevents him from showing up later in the game.
(16) Terrorist – EXAMINE KNIFE to learn that it’s a suicide knife. In order to impress this chick 
you should KILL MYSELF WITH KNIFE! Fortunately the knife is a prop, but the terrorist, awe-
inspired, leaves the room. This reveals a broken vending machine.

MAP 5:
(25) Author – William Denman himself is sitting here (this game is getting really strange!) He 
agrees to fix the vending machine.

MAP 3:
(16) – INSERT COIN IN MACHINE to get a BOMB!

MAP 5:
(23) Catapult Room – first, PUT BOMB ON CATAPULT and PRESS BUTTON ON WALL to 
blow a hole in the roof, preventing your own untimely death. Next, it’s your own turn to go. 
Thinking merry thoughts won’t get you far, though. Instead, SIT ON CATAPULT and PRESS 
BUTTON ON WALL to fly to point E. Here you should get the JAR. Getting out of here is a bit 
tricky since those things on the map are revolving doors, and they can prove quite annoying! 
Eventually, you’ll make it :-)

MAP 3:
(19) Entomologist – Just GIVE CATERPILLAR TO ENTOMOLOGIST, and in return your jar will 
be filled with KILLER ANTS!

MAP 5:
(26) Tourist – if you OPEN JAR, the ants will eat the poor guy but leave his LUNCH behind (how 
considerate)

[the finale, coming next, has more face changes than Mission: Impossible ;-) It seems like the 
author ran out of ideas – or maybe he just didn’t like being disturbed by silly adventurers?]

MAP 2:
(12) Surgery – enter here, say YES and GIVE COINS TO SURGEON to get the face of James T. 
Kirk.

MAP 4:
(20) Star Trek – if you look like Kirk, Dr. McCoy will give you a broken TRANSPORTER.

MAP 2:
(12) Surgery – more facial cuts, this time you’ll look like Andy Taylor (maybe the Duran Duran 
one?).

MAP 3:
(15) Fix-it shop – if you look like Andy here and GIVE the LUNCH TO EMMIT, he’ll gladly fix 
McCoy’s broken transporter for you.

MAP 2:
(12) Surgery – (this is really getting tedious!) have the face of the Master Mystic!

MAP 4:
(22) Master Mystic – stand outside, PRESS BUTTON ON TRANSPORTER to be able to walk 
though walls. Now, DROP RAT SUIT and walk forward though the closed door to enter the lair of 
the M.M. If you do not look like him, the game will restart without further explanation. Otherwise, 
if you are carrying the scroll from the spiritual master at (18), the M.M. will vanish, leaving you 
with a DRAGON RING. This will serve as proof of the fact that you now have completed your 
mission.

MAP 1 (go via MAP 3, _not_ via MAP 2!):
(1) – LOOK UNDER BED and GET PICTURE FROM UNDER BED to find a photo of yourself.

MAP 2:
(12) Surgery – (final one, promise!) say YES to surgery then GIVE PICTURE TO SURGEON to 
get your old face back. Now, simply walk through the same door where you ended part one to finish 
the game!

*** Congratulations!!! *** 
You have escaped from the asylum
