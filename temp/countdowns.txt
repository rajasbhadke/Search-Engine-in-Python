
COUNTDOWN TO SHUTDOWN (Maze Adventure)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, joystick


     North America's chief power source, an automated reactor complex the size of a small city, has developed a small glitch; well, actually, it's overheating. If your Android Crisis Team can't repair the malfunction before core temperature reaches 10000 degrees centigrade, shutdown will plunge most of the continent into protracted darkness.

     Your task in "Countdown '" is formidable. Many of the eight-level installation's 2000 plus rooms are guarded by anti-intrusion droids; nearly half the elevators don't work; some of the floors have been blown out leaving gaping pits; somewhere down on level eight is the reactor core, but no one seems to know exactly where. Fortunately you direct a team of up to eight science, repair, and combat androids entirely capable of making the best possible use of shields, weapons, repair kits, and other supplies strewn about the complex.

     Featuring the fastest, smoothest, most attractive display of any major maze adventure, "Countdown to Shutdown" incorporates just enough droid-zapping arcade action to spice play. Versatile controls and an excellent, multi-team capability game save round out an adventure package that's sure to be a trend setter.
