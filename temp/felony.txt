
FELONY (Parlor Game for 1 to 4 players)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, KB input


     Dust off your trenchcoat. "Felony", CBS's sequel to "Murder by the Dozen", is ready with twelve more dastardly deeds requiring your special attentions.

     As in "Murder'" you begin with a brief crime report and, via judicious questioning and keen investigation, not only crack the case; but do so before any of your fellow sleuths. Unlike its predecessor, "Felony" offers a nice potporri of crimes; so the quarry may be a thief, forger, terrorist, or other felonious type. This is not to accuse the game designers of squeamishness (note please Case 2: The Garroted Photographer) or of otherwise letting up. If anything the new cases are even jucier and more involved than the first dozen.

     At roughly ninty challenging minutes per four-player game, "Felony" is an entertainment bargain that's hard to top. Score another parlor game winner for CBS.
