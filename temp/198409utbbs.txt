From the Jason Scott / TEXTFILES.COM Printout Collection

These are original linefeed printouts fed through a Optical Character
Recognition system, with hand-editing done afterwards to clean issues
with text rearrangement and OCR errors. 

The printouts are from a collection dating from 1983-1985, and were
generally made on an Epson MX-80 Dot-Matrix printer connected to an
IBM PC-XT. The Bulletin Board Systems and other services were located
throughout the United States, and captured by Jason Scott, who can
attest to their authenticity.

Spelling errors, content and extraneous system information such as 
prompts and menu items have been left untouched. Errors and other 
artifacts of conversion to this format should be considered in 
determining the validity or historical context of statements in these
printouts.
