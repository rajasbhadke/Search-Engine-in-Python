     In this tutorial, I hope to teach

you a little about the Net-Works

program, and how to destroy any NW

board you might happen to hate.

 

     Nick Naimo (the author of NW)

left quite a few bugs in his program,  

maybe on purpose...  Who knows?  Here

are a few of them.

    How to mildly annoy the sysop

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

 

     Type 'G' at the main menu prompt.

when it asks you for a number, enter

a valid number plus a decimal...

for instance, 3.5.  This will create

a one sector file called "J.3.5.SYS"

which will never be erased unless the

sysop himself CATALOGs the disk and

DELETEs them all by hand.

 

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

How to destroy (almost) any system file

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

 

     To destroy almost any system file,

there must be a board sharing drive 1,

where most of the system files are

kept.  Post a message called

 

USERS.SYS

TITLES or TITLES1 or TITLES.1

MENU.SYS

 

with a space in front of it...

for instance, to destroy the password

file, post a message called

" USERS.SYS", the space in the

front is lost when the file is re-read,

so go to another board, and then back

to the board you posted on.  Then,

Remove the mesage you just posted...

it will delete the "USERS.SYS" and

leave " USERS.SYS" alone....

Pretty cool, eh?

 

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

     How to get into the monitor

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

 

     This is the best crash there is,

I think... If the board you are

crashing has not been protected from

it, it will always A) hang totally

or B) go into the monitor.  What you

want to do is this:  type 'E' at the

main menu prompt, and then when it asks

you for a name, enter garbage.... or

a real name, it really doesn't matter.

When it says "50 lines max., to end

type --> /EX <--" you do this:

 

A) Hit <RETURN> once.

B) Type /EX

C) Type 'F' at the choices.

D) Enter "99E99" for the line number

   to fix.

E) Goto step A when it says 50 lines...

   again.

 

After about 6-10 times of this, you

will hear a BEEP as it goes into

the monitor.... if control-C works,

then you're into basic!  If it doesn't,

then you'll just have to wait for the

SYSOP to come along and hit RESET and

re-run his board.

 

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

   What to do if you get into basic

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

 

     If you get into basic, then check

to see if he has his program saved

on his disk.  If he does, then make

a few 'backdoors' so you can get into

basic anytime you want to, and then

SAVE it onto his disk... then type

RUN.  You'll lose carrier, and he'll

never know what hit him when suddenly

his password file gets deleted every

night!

 

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

             Sysop access

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

 

     Another useful thing to know

is if you if you enter a sysop

password  you can get very high access. 

For instance let's say you log on and 

see the normal log on...

 

Connected to:  Joe's BBS

 

Enter account number or the word 'NEW'.

 

---> 

 

At that point, you should enter some-

thing like:  E1EL (that is a common

sysop password).  When it says

"Invalid Password" you should type

the word "NEW".  Enter whatever you

want for the name, and when it

asks you for a phone, just hit

<RETURN>... It won't assaign a pass-

word, but who cares.  When you get

into the BBS, type "Y".  You should

either have a level of 9 or special

download access (on T-I-M-E-C-O-R

you get special download access).

The only problem is that you are

not validated... if the sysop is

stupid enough, he may validate you 

if you chat so you can just "look

around".  The main use for this 

small tip is to look at a high

level "G" section you don't

need to be validated to look at.

 

Note:  on boards requiring account

       numbers, you should enter

       1 as the account number.

 

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

                 END

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

 

P.S.  Be careful how you distribute

      this, if everyone in the

      country gets hold of it, every

      board will be protected and this

      tutorial will be useless...

      Keep that in mind, and have

      PHUN!!!

 

 

(>Too late!!!!



Everyone in the country already has a 

copy of it but it's good for little

shits who think they can be "K00L" and

put up a NW board.



HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA



This file is pretty useless now but you

might as well try it on boards run at

offices, schools, etc... And the boards

run be teachers, businessmen, etc...

because these people don't know what 

they are doing.



Later

      We all have that one local board around you that you would really

like to crash! Maybe the sysop did something really bad to you or

something in that nature! Boy he sure would get Mad when he wakes up with

both drives burned out, user file is messed up or something like that!



      One thing to remember is when you call the board to crash it, I'd

use a phoney allias name (even another person you want to get revenge 

on too!) because they will really get mad about crashing thier board and 

will really kick some ass when they find out who did it. Just a warning!



1> Lets say the sysops name to the GBBS board is "Butch Jr.". Call the 

place up and when it asks for your last name, type "Jr.". When it asks

for your password, type in what ever you have to type for a new user.

Then it should ask for your first name. Just type " Butch" (1 space 

infront of name). This will automaticly put you into sysop command 

level and you will be able to delete messages, users, exit the GBBS

program and initalize the disks and ect.....Just about anything your 

little heart wants to do! Modify the board and delete the sysop too!

This way for crashing also works when you type in for last name:" Jr."

and first name "Butch". It should do the same thing. The one major 

drawback to this way of crashing is that most GBBS boards have thier 

oards modified to that you can't do this. They will have it either 

hang up after you type it in, Display a nasty message for you, or 

just ask for the last name again. Oh well! No body is perfect!



2> Call the board up and log on as a new user. When it asks for the 

city/state you live in, type in a few commas like this:

       "Tampa,,,,,,,,,,Fla" or ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," will do!

You just have to have more than 2 or 3 commas to do the job right.

This way should kill the passwords on the user file! <ool!!



3> When you leave a message up on the board, save it, and then it says

"Wait" for about 10 seconds. Try this one: Leave a message on the board

and save it and when it says "Wait", Just do a little "esc-h" 

(to hang up in Ascii Express). That way should be writting the message 

and when it looses the carrier, it will be off the hook for the night!

You can hang up on either "Wait" (after saving message and after you 

abort into the main command board.



4> When the GBBS asks for a number like board number or something like

that, type in "99E99". This creats and error on the board and might put

you in sysop command level depending on what serial number the GBBS 

program is. It will do some other things too.



5> When you log on and it asks for your password, type in a negative

number like "G-99FFF" or "A-01AAA" or some negative number kinda like

that. This should also create an error and might even put you in sysop

command level (you can do anything from there! Believe me!) But 

like I said before, Depending on what type of serial number the program

is.



6> Log on as a new user and when it's reading the new user welcome or 

just any text file, type "Cntl-s Cntl-p :" and that should make a fatal

error on his part and put you proptly into basic or machine language 

with dos loaded and you can work from there!



7> New user reading welcome message and type "Cntl-s Cntl-p *" and 

that will bomb the board out also.



8> New user reading welcome message and type "Cntl-s Cntl-p" and start 

pounding on the keyboard! That sould fill the buffer up and make a 

fatal error and put you into machine language or basic. Work from there!



9> New user reading welcome message and type "Cntl-s" and hold repeat

and "Cntl-p" down and that will also bomb the buffer too and put 

you into machine or basic language.



     Some of these ways have been tested before we made this and then

sone of the ways haven't. So you will be on your own when crashing!

  

     Please let us know on how successful you were in crashing and 

also any other ways not mensioned in this crash file! We know thier 

are others still floating around so please let us know. Just call my 

ae line and leave a little message and it will be included in the 

next GBBS part ][ file starting soon! My AE line number is:

How to crash Fido bbs's.. hmm this is a very easy thing to do.. 
so this file will be very short.. ok.. try this.. 


When you get to a message area do an area command and it will list
all of the message areas..

---- Fido ----
1... General 
2... Tech 
3..* Fido Mail
Message?     <-- when you get a promt here type.. 3333333, 6 to 7 threes
                 and this will lock the system up.. as of Fido 11w I'm not
                 sure if this still works.. 


     But remember that the sysop has his logs and such so he can see who
   called and such.. he will also know how you did it.. it will stay on his   
   screen. 

         
well.. thats one way.. the next way is to goto a message area and use the
Edit command on a message.. <Fido has major bugs in Message areas> Well, 
this is what you do from there.. 


    goto the message area and enter a message, then edit something in the
  message. When it gives you the promt "New String:" enter like over 80+
  characters. And it will give you a bunch of forward slashs, then hit 
  return. ok.. thats half of the bitch! Now! Go over there and type 'I'
  to use the Insert command and then the line number that you just edited
  it will them fuck up big time!!! Yes thats it you have now locked up
  one of the worlds most popular systems! well done dude!
