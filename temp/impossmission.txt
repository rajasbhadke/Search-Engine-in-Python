     When his marathon effort to crack "Penguin Invader's" 100 billion high score limit was twarted by a power failure (one penguin short of success!), something snapped in the young Elvin Atombender's brilliant mind. The world, he resolved, would pay for this gross injustice.

     Now an expert in computers and robotics, Elvin is six hours away from invading the launch computers of every major power and triggering a nuclear holocaust. To save civilization you must penetrate Elvin's 32-room underground complex, discover the Control Room password, and stop the warped genius before any launch codes are issued.

     Being absent minded, Elvin did write down the password; however he took the precaution of breaking it into pieces now hidden throughout his stronhold (in furniture, candy machines, etc.). Each multi-tiered room is patrolled by laser-armed robots, with lifts providing access to each tier. Fortunately, you are faster and more agile than the robots; and, better still, occassionally discover "snooze codes" which deactivate a room's guardians. In two rooms additional snooze codes may be won by sounding musical notes in the proper sequence.

     The game is a nicely executed blend of several successful arcade ideas. The result is an engaging, mini-adventure challenge for thinking stick flippers everywhere
