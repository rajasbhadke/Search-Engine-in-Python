          ^^^^^^^^ RECLAIM THE VALLEYS ^^^^^^^^^^

CELTIC ENERGY (The open-cast mining giants) are one of
South Wales' biggest environmental enemies. They intend to carve a
huge hole out of South Wales' valleys, effectively destroying local
communities, their environment and causing devestating damage to
richly diverse ecosystems. In 30 years time the beautiful lush green
valleys of South Wales which inspired all which inspired the likes of
Dylan Thomas to harp on and on about the lush green valleys that
are part of Welsh heritage will be nothing more than a slag heap, with
a thin token veneer of monoculture.

      WALES IS IN DANGER AND MUST BE DEFENDED !!

CELTIC ENERGY owns a considerable wedge of the land, stretching
from the South west Coast to the boarder of the Brecon National
Park near Merthyr Tydfil (check a map - Its a big wedge!). They are
cuurently waiting on planning permission, but apparently only as a
result of the Welsh office overturning local decisions that went
against CELTIC ENERGY'S plans. You may have already heard of
SELAR and BRYNHENLLYS, both these sites which were established
early last summer have been evicted at considerable cost. There is
now a new site being set up at NANT GYRLAIS, which is still in the
planning stage with strong local opposition (Similar to Selar &
Brynhenllys).
CELTIC ENERGY is a private company that still needs to float shares
on the stock market. It is rumoured that they are struggling
financially.

Open-Cast mining, most agree is environmentally devestating, seeing
it first hand in the Neath valley, nearly a decade after coal
extraction, the land remains barren and desert-like.
Open-Casting produces no new jobs for the local communities,
where youth unemployment is higher than most places in the country
Instead, it promises clouds of coal dust which has been demonstrated
in past cases to increase the incidence of asthma (especially in
kids). Raising rich marsh and woodland to dusty scars across
the landscape. The environmental and sociological effects of
CELTIC ENERGY's intended programme of coal extraction could
be profoundly disturbing life in The Valleys.

             THIS DESTRUCTION CAN BE STOPPED

                 PRINT-OFF AND PASS THIS ON.

If you can bring cameras of any form to document the activities of
this week of action, please do.

Our persistance in this matter can and eventually will prevent CELTIC
ENERGY and their shortsighted selfish agenda from destroying what
is still a green and pleasent land.

We look forward to seeing you,
