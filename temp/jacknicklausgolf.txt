Jack Nicklaus's Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf

     This is a way to eliminate the need to look up holes on the hard-to-see red sheet. It is by Brian A. Troha and was originally published in issue #71 of Computist:

1. Make a copy of both game diskettes.

2. On the Copy of the Program Disk:

a. Search for these (Hex) bytes using Block Warden, BlockWork, or a ProDOS version of Copy II Plus ...

   F0 04 22 BA 03 00

Probably, you will find the bytes in Block $092 (decimal 146) starting at Byte $07F.

b. Enter EDIT mode and change ...

   F0 04        to  80 04
   22 BA 03 00  to  AF BA 03 00

c. Write the changed block back to the diskette.


     Use the diskette copies to play the game.
