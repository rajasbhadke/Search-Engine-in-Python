Liberals are Scared of Revolution
by Sunfrog
(all apologies to The Last Poets)

Liberals are scared of revolution
But liberals wish they were revolutionary
Because revolution is all about change
And liberalism likes to change
Liberals vote Democrat to change the system
They change from Pepsi to Coke, Bush to Clinton,
warfare to welfare, right to life to abortion rights
Liberals change the face in power but power
still dominates even if white folks sing
``Fight the Power'' or
``The Times They-Are-A-Changin'''
like some Bob Dylan flashback
When it comes to truly radical change
Liberals are scared of revolution 

Liberals are liars & Woodstock tie-dyers
Liberals lie & cry when someone dies
Liberals loved Martin & Bob Kennedy
Donate to charity, think they're a rarity
But when it comes time to donate to revolution
Liberals say ``I gave at the office''
They like co-ops with bosses
Liberals are scared of revolution 

Liberals are hypocritical, hyper-critical
only like revolt when it's hypothetical
Liberals love politics, liberals love politicians
Liberals love to lobby, write their congressman,
sign petitions, wear a t-shirt, buy a bumper sticker,
let their candle flicker
Liberals love democracy, Liberals love politics
But when we talk about the politics of everyday life
the politics of desire, the politics of liberation
Liberals say ``Don't be so political''
Liberals are scared of revolution 

Liberals protest, Liberals carry a sign,
love to complain, drive to D.C., say ``listen to me''
Liberals protest war by shouting ``We Support Our Troops''
Liberals protest the homophobic military by partying on battleships
& insisting that queers are qualified to kill the enemies of the empire
Liberals march to remember the drag queens of Stonewall but
excluded bisexuals & transgendered people from the name on the 
banner
Stonewall was a riot but liberals want a riotous good time
assimilating & selling out
Liberals are scared of revolution 

Liberals are givers; Liberals love to give
Liberals give money to the ACLU, NAACP, NOW, Greenpeace & the 
Sierra Club
Liberals give speeches, liberals give their kids trips to the beaches
Liberals love to give you a piece of their mind
Liberals love to give advice
Liberals give lip service to workers & poor
but when it comes to give spare change to revolution
Liberals are scared of revolution 

Liberals are leaders are leaders are leaders
They love to lead the sing-a-long
But they'll never join the throng
Liberals love to hear Tracy Chapman
sing ``Talkin' about a Revolution''
But they don't love revolution
Yet I was born a Liberal
Liberals are me
I love the libertartian impulse in Liberals
as they talk about the concept of freedom
But there is one thing about liberals I do not love:
Liberals are scared of revolution ?
