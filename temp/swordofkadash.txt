Sword of Kadash (Maze Adventure)
Compatible: 48k Apple II+, //e
Requirements: One disk drive; joystick optional

     Just as you are beginning to wonder if there are worse things than being ripped off and abandoned in the Persian desert, up rides a party of brigands whose leader makes an offer that's hard to refuse: Enter the Fortress of the Dragon and retrieve the fabled Sword of Kadash, or, wash the blistering sands with your blood.

     Having volunteered, you soon discover why no one has ever returned from the dread fortress. Besides monsters, elaborate traps, curses, and backlash from your own weapon, you must contend with the maze itself. Armor, weapons, monster repulsion spells, and other goodies do litter the labyrinth; but the price you pay is usually a hefty chunk of precious hit points.

     Unfortunately, the major barrier to success has little to do with the scenario or player skill. Learning about traps costs lives (experience and possessions are reset to zilch in each case). Lose your last life and your record is wiped out; you must reboot the master, make another playable copy, and start from scratch.

     Responsive controls, attractive displays, and smooth animation go far towards making "Sword of Kadash" fun to play; and several of the chambers do pose interesting problems. Poor mechanics, however, make a potentially great game close to unplayable.
