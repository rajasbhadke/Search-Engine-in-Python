
Gunslinger (Picture/Text Adventure)
Compatibility: 48K Apple II series
Requirements: One disk drive; joystick optional


     As Kip Star, former Texas Ranger, you've spent a few peaceful years just wandering around the West. Then, one day, you hear that an old Ranger pal, James Badland, is fixin' to get himself hanged down in Mexico! In DataSoft's Gunslinger your mission to prevent an unfortunate miscarriage of justice soon mushrooms into a mini-war with the dangerous Dalton brothers; and you know, for sure, there's no hangin' up your irons 'til the Big Showdown!

     With over one hundred hires frames Gunslinger takes you to ghost towns, saloons, abandoned mines, army forts, indian villages, and more. Throughout, your main concerns are gathering information pointing to your next destination and finding or trading for needed items. Often, too, you will need money to buy supplies, pay for tickets, and similar necessities. Gambling is one way to 'wealth'; another, slightly safer, route is working "mined-out" gold diggings. Either way, make sure your sixgun is loaded and loose in the holster. One slip and it's your money AND your life!

     A remarkably violent beginning-level adventure, the game offers multi-position save/restore and employs simple, yet entirely adequate parsing. While most players will prefer keyboard entry of text; the joystick controlled "word-selector" option does allow you to scroll through all operational verbs, nouns, and prepositions (i.e. a sort of built-in hint generator). Featuring a plethora of puzzlets and almost as many well-drawn pictures as cliches', Gunslinger is sure-shooting fun for new adventure gamers.
