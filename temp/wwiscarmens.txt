
WHERE IN THE WORLD IS CARMEN SANDIEGO? (Knowledge Game)
Compatible: 64K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, KB or joystick input


     Somewhere in the world another priceless nic-nac has been snatched and everything points to one of Carmen Sandiego's gang of no goods. Armed with dossiers, a complete "World Almanac" (supplied with the game), and access to Interpol's Crime Computer, your assignment is to identify, track down, and arrest the culprit before the 5 p.m. Sunday deadline.

     Representing the new crop of super slick, 'different' entertainment software, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego challenges knowledge of geographical trivia and deductive skills. Though your elusive quarry hops jets the way most people use taxis, he can't avoid leaving some destination and ID clues (e.g. "he changed his money to dollars" or "he had black hair").

     Insightful investigation is the key. The one-week deadline doesn't leave much time for sightseeing, especially at the higher levels where the chase may lead through six or seven cities.

     Nominally a single person game, "Carmen Sandiego" is best in small groups.  (It's more fun to be smart if someone else is watching.)

     Each of an endless supply of scenarios takes only about twenty minutes; so, several players can compete, each to advance his or her sleuth's rank (saved on disk) and the chance to nab Carmen herself. (Hint: She's been seen wherever great games are sold.)
