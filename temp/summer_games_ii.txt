INTRODUCTION

A thousand athletes. A hundred countries. Billions watching
around the world as you enter the stadium, marching confidently
among your nation's strongest, fastest and boldest young men
and women. Your gaze sweeps the crowd as you realize the scope
of your achievement. You are walking in the footsteps of Jim
Thorpe and Jesse Owens. In the footsteps of the ancient Greeks.
You are about to compete against the world's best athletes in a
3,000-year-old competition. The pinnacle of athletic
achievement. The Summer Games.

The majesty, scope and glory of the original SUMMER GAMES TM
return in SUMMER GAMES II.TM Now you can explore the thrill of
the world's greatest athletic competition with eight brand new
events. Challenge your timing in the triple jump. Test your
endurance in the equestrian arena. From fencing to kayaking,
you'll be at the heart of the action as you "go for the gold."

Strategy, skill and determination are the qualities you'll need
to succeed. Give your best in every event. Nothing can be held
back. Not if you want to be a champion. Strive for victory --
if you win, the gold medal will be yours. Break the world
record, and your achievement will be heralded as the greatest
performance ever!

There's plenty of time for practice, but you'd better be ready
when the fanfare sounds the start of the opening ceremonies,
because this is world class competition. This is SUMMER GAMES II.


OBJECTIVE

SUMMER GAMES II challenges your competitive skills with a
series of athletic contests for 1 to 8 players. Experience the
excitement and realism of eight different events -- cycling,
equestrian, fencing, high jumps, javelin, kayaking, rowing, and
triple jump.

Practice each event first to sharpen your skills. Then choose
from the 18 countries you can represent in the competition and
let the Games begin!

Try to win the gold as you compete in each event. You'll get a
silver medal if you finish second and a bronze medal if you come
in third. Try to win the most medals as you compete in all the
events. SUMMER GAMES II keeps scores, handles the judging, and
awards medals to all of the winners.

If you break a "World Record," SUMMER GAMES II will save your
name and display it on a special World Records screen.

So get ready to give it your best. The thrills and excitement
of SUMMER GAMES II are about to begin.

STARTING PLAY

A spectacular opening ceremony welcomes you to SUMMER GAMES II.
The lighting of the flame marks the start of the international
competition. White doves are released over the stadium -- a
traditional symbol of peace.

Once the opening ceremony concludes, a menu screen offers you a
choice of nine options. To make a selection, use your joystick
to move the cursor to your choice, then press the FIRE BUTTON.
If you are using the keyboard, you can either use the cursor
keys to move up and down the menu, type the corresponding
numbered key, or press I to move up the menu, or M to move
down, and then RETURN to make the selection.


OPTION 1: COMPETE IN ALL THE EVENTS
This option allows the players to compete in all eight (or

THE GAMES

All events in SUMMER GAMES II can be controlled with either the
joystick, or the keyboard. Movements from the keyboard are
depicted below.

     (FORWARD)

         I
         |
(LEFT) J---K (RIGHT)
         |
         M

   (DOWN or BACK)

TRIPLE JUMP

The stadium is alive with excitement as the athletes prepare to
compete in the first track and field event. The triple jump
consists of three continuous, fluid actions: the hop, the step,
and the jump. Victory in this event requires strength and
coordinated, fluid movement!

* Press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR to start running down the
  track.
* When you reach the takeoff line, move the joystick to the RIGHT
  or press the K key to begin the "hop."
* As you land after the hop, move the joystick to the RIGHT or
  press the K key again to initiate the "step."
* As you land from the step, move the joystick LEFT or press the
  J key to begin the "jump."
* Finally, push the joystick FORWARD or press the I key to give
  yourself a final boost as you fly through the air into the
  landing pit.

Note: The joystick movements correspond to the movements of
your feet. (i.e. Move the joystick RIGHT or press the K key to
jump off from the right foot.)

* Timing is important in this event. You must move the joystick
  or press the appropriat key at just the right moment to perform
  each action correctly.

  * The right moment to move the joystick or press the key for the
    takeoff, or hop, is just as you reach the takeoff line.
  * The proper time for the step and the jump is just as you land
    from the previous jump.

* The judges will declare a fault if you move too late for any of
  the three actions.
* After each jump, press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR to continue
  play.
* You get three attempts in the triple jump.
* The longest of your three attempts becomes your final score.
* The winner is the player who achieves the greatest distance in
  a single attempt.


ROWING

The single sculls is the most demanding rowing event in the
Games. Alone in your boat, you confront a single opponent in
head-to-head competition. Be ready to bend to the oars when the
countdown reaches "GO." Keep a steady rhythm going, because a
single stroke can mean the difference between victory and
defeat!

* You will be rowing against a computer player on the top half of
  the screen. Your rower is on the bottom half of the screen.
  Press the FIRE BUTTON on the joystick or the SPACE BAR on the
  keyboard to begin the countdown.
* When the countdown reaches "GO," begin rowing by moving the
  joystick to the LEFT or pressing the J key to pick up your
  oars, and then to the RIGHT or the K key to push them through
  the water (the stroke).
* Practice in order to get the best rhythm for the fastest
  movement through the water.
* Continue rowing by moving the joystick LEFT and then RIGHT, or
  pressing J, then K, alternating the rhythm of the oars.
* After the end of the race, press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR
  to begin the next event.
* The winner is the rower with the fastest final time.


JAVELIN

Soaring in a long, graceful arc, the javelin brings
appreciative cheers when thrown with power and precision. To
win, you must build up speed on the runway and choose the right
moment to throw. Strive to release the javelin at the best
angle for distance in flight and you'll make a record-breaking
throw!

* Press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR to start running down the
  track.
* Keep pressing the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR to gain speed on the
  runway. The more times you press the button or key, the faster
  you will go.
* As you near the end of the runway, move the joystick LEFT or
  press the J key to break stride and begin your throw.
* As you hold the joystick to the LEFT, the javelin will continue
  to rise (keyboard only requires one key press). When you
  release the joystick or press the K key, it will "lock in" the
  angle and begin the throw.
  * If you release the javelin too low, your throw will have a low
    arc.
  * Releasing the javelin too high will result in a high throw and
    a disappointing performance.
  * The best angle to release the javelin at will be discovered
    through practice.
* If you cross the throwing line, you will incur a fault.
* You get three attempts to throw the javelin. Your longest throw
  will be recorded as your final score.
* Press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR to continue after each throw.
* The winner is the player with the longest throw.


EQUESTRIAN

This is the pinnacle of competition for horse and rider -- a
fierce test of skill and endurance. You must be prepared for
anything, because even a champion thoroughbred can fall or
refuse to jump. Keep a tight grip on the reins and watch out:
stone walls can be dangerous!

* Press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR when you are ready to begin.
* Watch the countdown at the bottom of the screen. When it
  reaches "GO," push the joystick FORWARD or press the I key to
  start the horse.
* Your horse's speed will increase each time you push the
  joystick FORWARD or press the I key. It will decrease each time
  you pull the joystick BACK or press the M key.
* As you arrive at each barrier, move the joystick to the RIGHT,
  key K, to make the horse jump.
  * If you move too early or too late, the horse may refuse to jump.
* As your horse lands, push the joystick to the LEFT, key J, to
  prevent him from falling.
* If your horse stops in front of a barrier, he has refused to
  jump.
  * Pull the joystick BACK, key M, to make the horse turn around.
  * Go back far enough from the barrier to build up speed for the
    jump, then push the joystick FORWARD, key I, to turn the horse
    around again and continue on the course.
* If your horse falls, press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR once to
  get back in the saddle and then press it again to start the
  horse.
* Penalties are assessed for refusals and falls. You are also
  penalized for exceeding the time limit for the course.
  * 6 points for each time you fall.
  * 20 points for each refusal to jump.
  * 1 point for every second that your time exceeds the optimal
    time of 50 seconds.
* You can be disqualified if:
  * Your total points from faults and refusals exceeds 99.
  * Your total time exceeds 100 seconds.
* This is a very difficult event. Success requires practice and
  concentration. Try to anticipate the next obstacle and strive
  for a smooth transition from one jump to the next.
* The winner of this event is the contestant with the lowest
  score.


HIGH JUMP

A cheer wells up from the crowd as you approach the high-jump
bar for your final attempt. Already you have shattered the
record. Two and a half meters. Now you are striding toward a
bar set even higher. Gather your strength and feel your legs
explode as you soar over the bar!

* The display at the bottom of the screen shows the contestant's
  name and country, and the bar height. The bar begins at the
  minimum height.
* If you wish to compete at that height, move joystick to the
  RIGHT, K key. If not, then move the joystick to the LEFT, key
  J, to answer "NO." If all of the players decide not to jump,
  the bar is raised and the question is asked again.

* After you accept a bar height, the display will read "FIRST
  ATTEMPT," "SECOND ATTEMPT" or "THIRD ATTEMPT." Press the FIRE
  BUTTON or SPACE BAR to begin.
* Hold your joystick to the RIGHT or press the K key to begin
  running.
* As you make your approach, move the joystick or press the
  appropriate key to control your position and speed.
  * FORWARD, or key I, to approach closer to the bar.
  * BACK, or key M, to widen the angle of your approach to the bar.
  * RIGHT, or key K, to continue running. To run faster, hold the
    joystick to the RIGHT and continuously press the FIRE BUTTON or
    the K key.
  * Press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR to jump. If you do not, you
    will run past the bar. You may then repeat the attempt without
    penalty.
  * Push the joystick FORWARD, or key I, to flip up and over the
    bar.

* You get three attempts to clear each height. Three successive
  failures eliminate you from the high jump competition.
* You may refuse a jump even after you have made one or two
  attempts at a given height. You will then be able to compete at
  the next height.
* The bar height is raised after each round.
* The winner of this event is the last player to be eliminated.

FENCING

You need good strategy, flawless timing and lightning reflexes
to capture the gold in this event. Try to stay on the attack,
but don't ignore your defenses. En garde!

* Press the <- or -> cursor keys in order to select a skill level
  and press RETURN. Press any key to start.
* The name of the first contestant is displayed on the scoreboard
  at the bottom of the screen. You are the fencer on the left,
  the computer player is the fencer on the right.
* Press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR to salute your opponent and
  begin the bout.
* FOR DEFENSE, move the joystick or press the appropriate keys to
  try to block your opponent's moves.
* To block (parry) your opponent use the following keyboard keys
  or use the joystick:

KEYBOARD:

    Q            w             E
              (FOIL UP)
(FOIL LEFT)                (FOIL RIGHT)
    A            S             D
              (CENTER)

    Z            X             C
            (FOIL DOWN)

JOYSTICK:
  * Move the joystick UP or DOWN to position your foil at the same
    level as your opponent's foil.
  * Move your joystick LEFT or RIGHT to position your foil to the
    extreme left or right. (You can also move the joystick in
    diagonal directions such as down and to the left.)
* Now make a sweeping motion with your foil by moving your
  joystick in the other direction. If your foil was positioned
  correctly, you will block your opponent's foil, immobilizing it
  for a brief moment. You can now thrust to score a hit on your
  opponent.
* For attacking moves, and to control your fencer's movement on
  the field of play, press and hold the FIRE BUTTON or CONTROL
  key and move the joystick or press the appropriate key:
  * FORWARD with the joystick, or CONTROL and W keys, to thrust
    with your foil and recover to a defensive posture.
  * BACK with the joystick, or CONTROL and X, to thrust and advance.
  * LEFT with the joystick, or CONTROL and A, to move left on the
    playing field, or "fencing piste."
  * RIGHT with the joystick, or CONTROL and D, to move right on the
    fencing piste.
* A successful thrust scores a hit against your opponent.
* Retreating too close to the edge of the fencing piste will
  score a hit against you.
* The scoreboard displays the number of hits scored against each
  fencer.
* The winner of a bout is the player who scores the most hits
  against his opponent.
* A bout lasts until three minutes have elapsed, or until five
  hits are made against a fencer.
* If a score is tied at the end of three minutes, a one-minute
  "sudden death" fence-off begins. The first player to score a
  hit is declared the winner. If neither player scores a hit
  during the fence-off, both players are assessed a loss.
* Strategy is crucial in this event. You must try to catch your
  opponent off guard, parrying and feinting (by pulling back)
  before thrusting for a hit.
* If your blade is parried, you are temporarily defenseless and
  the only possible move is retreat.
* After completing a bout, press the FIRE BUTTON or the SPACE BAR
  to continue.
* The winner of the fencing competition is usually the player who
  wins the most bouts in the tournament. The actual rankings are
  determined by the number of points awarded for the margin of
  victory.
  * If you lose or tie: [Hits made x 1000]
  * If you win: [(Hits made x 1000) + (4 - Hits against) x 1000]


CYCLING

This is an all-out sprint for the finish line. You can't let up
even for a moment, because the margin of victory can be a
fraction of a second!

* You will be cycling against a computer player on the top half
  of the screen. Your cyclist is on the bottom half of the
  screen. Press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR to begin the
  countdown.
* When the countdown reaches "GO," begin pedaling.
* To pedal your bicycle, move your joystick from LEFT to RIGHT,
  or use keys J and K, following the movement of the rotating
  arrow.
  * When the arrow points UP, move your joystick to the RIGHT or
    press the K key.
  * When the arrow is pointing DOWN, move the joystick to the LEFT
    or press the J key.
* As the arrow speeds up, match your joystick speed or key
  strokes accordingly.
* After completing the race, press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR
  to continue.
* The winner of this event is the player who finishes the race in
  the shortest time.


KAYAKING

Kayaking involves speed, determination, and planning. Handling
your boat properly throughout the course is going to take your
last ounce of effort!

* Press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR when you are ready to begin.
* Each time you move the joystick or press the appropriate key,
  your kayaker will paddle in the direction indicated
  * FORWARD, I key, to go forward.
  * BACK, M key, to back up.
  * LEFT, J key, to turn left.
  * RIGHT, K key, to turn right.
* To continue paddling, press and hold the appropriate key or
  joystick direction. This way you can paddle continuously in the
  direction indicated unless you release the key or joystick.

* You must go through each gate properly to negotiate the course
  without incurring penalties. TO GO THROUGH A GATE PROPERLY, YOU
  MUST ALWAYS KEEP THE RED MARKER ON YOUR LEFT.
* There are three types of gates:
  * DOWNSTREAM NORMAL: This gate has a red marker on the left and a
    blue marker on the right. FACE FORWARD as you go through this
    gate.
  * DOWNSTREAM REVERSE: This gate has a white marker on the left
    and a red marker on the right. You must turn your kayak around
    and go through this gate BACKWARDS. (Red marker will be on your
    left as you pass through.)
  * UPSTREAM: This gate has a blue marker on the left and a red
    marker on the right. Go around this gate and pass through it in
    the OPPOSITE DIRECTION. Then turn your kayak around, go around
    the markers (don't go through them again) and continue to the
    next set of gates. Do not paddle through the gate backwards or
    you will incur a penalty.

* You receive a 20-second penalty each time you miss a gate or go
  through a gate the wrong way. Penalties are also assessed if
  you go through the same gate more than once. (You will hear a
  beeping noise each time you incur a penalty.)
* When you complete the course, a recap screen will display the
  gates you missed, completed, or went through incorrectly, as
  well as your total time.
* To improve your score, try to anticipate each gate and position
  your kayak accordingly. Always be thinking a gate or two ahead,
  and don't be afraid to paddle backwards to get into position (a
  missed gate is worse than a couple of seconds of lost time).
* After completing the course, press the FIRE BUTTON or SPACE BAR
  to advance to the next event.
* The winner of this event is the player with the fastest time
  (including penalties).


SCORING

AWARDS CEREMONY

After every event the names, countries, and scores of all
competitors are listed in the order they placed. The name of
the Gold Medal winner appears at the top of the screen, and his
or her country's national anthem is played.

CHAMPION CEREMONY

If players compete in all SUMMER GAMES II events, a Grand
Champion of the games is selected based on the number of medals
awarded.
        Gold Medal = 5 points
        Silver Medal = 3 points
        Bronze Medal = 1 point

The points are totaled after all events have been completed,
and the player with the most points is honored as the Grand
Champion. The ceremony takes place after the Awards Ceremony
for the final event.

CLOSING CEREMONY

Following the awards ceremony for the final event, a thrilling
Closing Ceremony brings the games to an end. Fireworks light up
the sky, and the famous EPYX blimp flies across the stadium,
closing out another exciting edition of SUMMER GAMES II.

WORLD RECORDS

If a world record is achieved in any event, the name of the
record-breaking player is saved by the SUMMER GAMES II program.
The records are displayed on the World Records screen. If a new
