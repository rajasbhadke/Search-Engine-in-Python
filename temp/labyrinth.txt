You! You there! Yes, you.  The one getting dirty fingerprints all over this
nice, clean book.

I am Jareth, the Goblin King, and you are mine.  From the movement you began
reading this, my grip upon your soul has tightened.  Test me.  Try to stop
reading.  You can't, can you?  You are my subject and you are destined to
bow to my will for the rest of your days.  The only way you can escape is to
find me in the center of my Labryrinth and destroy me.  Ha! Not only will you
be unable to navigate the Labyrinth, I doubt if you'll even be able to find
your way in!

And if be some chance you do manage to get inside,  I will easily defeat you.
I have many ways to do this.  There are rules in my Labyrinth, and woe to 
those who do not follow them.

I will give you only thirteen hours to solve the Labyrinth.  And I can assure
you...it isn't enough time.

I will set my army of goblins upon you.  Each of my goblins was once in the
same positions you are in now...and each failed to solve the many puzzles of
my Layrinth.  Now they work for me.  They will throw you into dark, dank
prisons I like to call my oubliettes...and forget about you. You will never 
find your way out.

I will lead you into untold dangers.  The Bog of Stench alone will easily
defeat you.  And if you should happen to fall in--if even one drop should
touch you--your smell will warn me of your presence...wherever you may try 
to hide.

I will recreate the Labyrinth even as you solve portions of it.  It will 
constantly change,  twisiting around itself like a maleevolent serpent.

Learn to love the Labyrinth, for you will be here forever.  But take comfort.
You will not be here alone.  I rule the other poor souls as well.  Hoggle
might befriend you..if you pay him enough.  Maybe you'd like to spend eternity
in the forest of the Fireys.  They may amuse you as they toss their arms and
legs about.  Perhaps they can lend you a hand!  (Oh, I do love a little joke..
especially at your expense.)

Some of the creatures in the Labyrinth are my minions, like Sir Didymus, who
guards the bridge over the bog...and always follows my rules.  Some of them--
like that assursed Ludo and his accursed friends, the rocks--have come close
to defeating me.  But never too close.  My faithful goblins take care of that.

They will take care of you, too.  And so will I.  This is my Labyrinth and
you are mind.  Forever.

In the Labyrinth you must find your way through a complicated maze, solve
riddles, figure out puzzles, and collect and use objects you find along the
way.  The object of the game is to ultimately escape through the castle at
the heart of the maze after confronting Jareth, King of the Goblins - before
the clock tolls thirteen.  You will win the game when you vanquish his power
over you.  But first you must get to him.

LOADING THE ADVENTURE

To start on your way through Jareth's kingdom, first make sure that you 
computer and all perpheral equipment, such as a printer and disk drives, are
turned off.  Then follow the steps below.

1. Insert the Labyrinth disk in your disk drive, label side up.
2. Turn on your computer and monitor.

After a few moments the title screen will appear.  Wait while the computer
loads the program.

STARTING THE GAME

When you first load the program, you will see a screen similar to this:

There are three save slots on the disk.  All three slots will be empty the
first time you load the game.  Pressing (Apple players: 1,2, or 3) will
determine which of these slots the game will begin using.  This will become
your current slot. If you choose an empty slot the game will start at the
very beginning.  In the screen shown above, the first and second slots have
a game saved in them and the third slot is empty.

To erase the game in a slot and start from the very beginning, hold down the
SHIFT key and then press the funtion key (Apple players: the corresponding
numeric key).  In the example above, pressing SHIFT-1 will make the first
slot your current slot, erase Jim's game, and start a new game.

After you choose an empty slot you can enter up to 10 characters when the 
screen prompts you for your name.  Then the game will begin.

GETTING AROUND THE LABYRINTH

Use the joystick as shown below to move your figure around the screen.  Apple
players can use either a joystick or the keyboard.  For joystick control, plug
in the joystick.  For keyboard control, hold down the SHIFT ket and use
the keyboard as shown below.  Apple players may use either button on the
joystick.

Using Word Wheels

Two board wheels across the bottom of the screen are used to enter commands
and phrases.  In effect, you use them to make sentences.  Select them by using
the SPACE BAR and CURSOR CONTROL keys on your computer.  When active, a 
wheel displays three lines of text information which can be scrolled 
vertically.  The selected word (or phrase) is always in the middle.  The
inactive wheel shows only the last word entered.

       !------------------!
       !//////Look////////!           !-----------------!
       !       Ask        !           ! Goblin          !
       !///////east///////!           !-----------------!



The left word wheel lists verbs (or actions you want to take place) and the
right word wheel lists the objects of the verbs.

Selecting Words

Some commands are single words (take,time) using only the left work wheel,
and other commands require words from both wheels (use-shears-ask-Jareth).
Once a wheel is selected, you can scroll through the list of words with the
Cursor Control keys.  When both wheels display the command you want, press
the RETURN key to enter it.  After the movie has started you can use the 
joystick button or the RETURN key.

Notice that the words on both wheels are listed in alphabetical order.  This
makes it easier to find words on the lists.

Instead of scrolling through the list to find an item on a wheel, you can type
the first letters of the desired word.  For example, if the present word
displayed is way up the list wheel at "call" do the following:

1. Select the left wheel.
2. Press the T key.  The list will show the first available word beginning
   with a T.  The T will be highlighted.
3. Press the I key.  TIME will be shown, and the ti portion of the word will
   be highlighted.
4. Press RETURN to complete the command.

If you make a mistake, you can use the delete key.  It will erase all the
highlighted characters and let you begin typing from the beginning.

To enter a double word command, just select the word on the first wheel, then
use the SPACE BAR or CURSOR CONTROL keys to movbe to second wheel.  Again,
select the word you want and press RETURN when you have the right combination.
For example, if you want to enter "congratulate Jareth," do the following.

1. Activate the left wheel.
2. Type CO to CONGRATULATE.
3. Press the SPACE BAR to activate the right wheel.
4. Type J to select JARETH.
5. Follow all commands with a RETURN or by pressing the button on the joystick

To make it easier to play Labyrinth, methods for saving the current state of
the game both automatically and whenever you wish you have been provided.
One thing to note: while the load and save game menus are on the screen the
clock is stopped.  You can use these commands to pause the game if you like:

AUTOMATIC SAVE

Every time you enter a scene, the program will automatically store the state
of the game in the current slot.  This means that if there is a power failure
you may always continue the game at the beginning of the last scene you 
entered by simply reloading it and selecting the appropriate slot.

NORMAL SAVE

During the game, you can use the SAVE GAME command (found on the left word
wheel) to save the current of the game.  A menu like the following will
appear.

            !-----------------------------------------------!
            !           PLEASE CHOOSE GAME TO SAVE          !
            !           OR PRESS SPACE BAR TO CANCEL.       !
            !                                               !
            !                F1 - JIM                       !
            !                F3 - GEORGE                    !
            !                F5 - JERZA  (HIGHLIGHTED)      !
            !                                               !
            !           PRESS SHIFT PLUS YOU SELECTION      !
            !           TO ERASE AND RESTART THAT GAME.     !
            !-----------------------------------------------!


Notice that the name "Jerza" is highlighted in this case, to show which slot
is currently selected.  There is a -> to the left of the selected slot.  
Saving the game in a slot other than the current slot will allow you take a
"snapeshot" of that state of the game.  The snapshoot won't store all
information, such as where the goblins might be, but all inmportant 
information, such as your inventory items, you will be saved.  If you choose
F1, the menu will look like this the next time you select SAVE GAME:

                 !----------------------------------------!
                 !       PLEASE CHOOSE GAME TO SAVE       !
                 !       OR PRESS SPACE BAR TO CANCEL.    !
                 !                                        !
                 !             F1 - JERZA                 !
                 !             F3 - GEORGE                ! 
                 !             F5 - JERZA                 !
                 !                                        !
                 !       PRESS SHIT PLUS YOU SELECTION    !
                 !       TO ERASE AND RESTART THAT GAME   !
                 !----------------------------------------!

When you continue playing, the current slot will continue to be automatically
updated as you enter new scenes.

Loading a Saved Game

During the game, you can use the LOAD GAME command (also found on the left
word wheel) to restore a previously saved game.  A menu like the following
will appear:


                   PLEASE CHOOSE A GAME TO LOAD.
                   OR PRESS SPACE BAR TO CANCEL.

                          F1 - JERZA
                          F2 - GEORGE
                          F5 - JERZA  (HIGHLIGHTED)
 
                    PRESS SHIFT PLUS YOUR SELECTION
                    TO ERASE AND RESTART THAT GAME.


If you select the current slot (f5 in the example above), the game will start
over at the beginning of the current scene.  If you select any other slot,
that game will be restored, and that slot will then become the current slot.
Pressing f1 in the example above will load in the slot one's game and make
it the current slot.  The next time LOAD GAME is selected, the menu will look
this:

                      PLEASE CHOOSE GAME TO LOAD
                      OR PRESS SPACE BAR TO CANCEL.

                          F5 - JERZA (HIGHLIGHT)
                          F3 - GEORGE
                          F1 - JEZRA

                      PRESS SHIT PLUS YOUR SELECTION
                      TO ERASE AND RESTART THAT GAME.


Sicne slot one will now be automatically updated as you move to the next
scene, you may want to make a snapshoot of the game and store it in either
slot two or slot three before you continue with the game.

RESTARTING THE GAME

To restart the game press CONTOL and R.

o Leave time-wasting situations as fast as possible
o Be nice...but assertive.  Everthing you do (or don't do will affect your
  game).
o Try creative, sometimes strange ways of solving a problem.
o It's generally harder to go backwards in the game to obtain something you
  need that to go foward.
o If you find yourself in a "loop" take some time to think about what you
  might have forgotten.
o If you wish to stop playing for a while and continue later, save the game
  first.  The automatic save will only take you back to the place and time
  you entered the last scene.
