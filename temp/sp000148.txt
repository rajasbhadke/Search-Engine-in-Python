         THE ANARCHIST GUIDEBOOK

             by Pete Winslow


          After you pay your taxes, buy all your licenses,

       submit to the draft and spend 40 hours a week at the

       office, you've still got maybe half an hour a day for
                                                    anarchy.


       Some of the things you can do are

        not read the newspaper

        not buy any advertised product

        jaywalk

        play the accordian badly on street corners

        write a subversive children's book

        eat something inedible like treebark erasers or
                                                dynamite

        go into a supermarket with various obscure items and
                                   place them on the shelves

        paint meat different colors

        organize protest marches at classic music stations   
                                    to demand top 40 tunes

        and enlist support for all candidates who campaign   
                                     in Uncle Sam costumes.


     After you have more experience with anarchy

       you can improvise.
