					D term 90 
 
  Underneath the Outer
      Layer of gray matter
  Lies the spot where the pain scratches
  Away... there, to the rear.
      Now it found
  An icepick;
              cold&
              sharp it pecks
  away at my brain
                   (where I know there are no nerves
                    and therefore this isn't happening the
                    way I feelthinkbelieve it is)
  like a sandpiper
           on the shore
  For it digs, I have no clue.
  Or maybe it's just me, mad at myself
                       for what I did
                             to you.  
  But what is a Gelatenous Oozer 
      doing in my output stream?
  Thots of one sliming its way
      thru the neural nets that are me
  Rise now, when an icepick
     Chips
           away at my natural self;
  A cancer, left to prowl thru
     what's left 
                 of my ruined mind...
   That battle-scarred, uneven terrain where Hamitt
  balked and down-shifted his rig to avoid capture
  but was lost anyway when they were just waiting for
  him on the other side.

  But 'twas the wrong night 4 the' grumblebums
  to be passive, and so they leaped and danced and
  softly stroked 1 another in public places,
  emitting the occasional soft moan or whimpering
  cry of ejaculation.
     Did it start? asked the Lateman as I 
  clocked out the wrong partner and quickly
  strode off to the plaza for to fetch another
  half of the human copulating unit.
