Duh, yeah, I got this one cable coming out of my TV. It pisses me off cause it 
gets in the way all the time. Sometimes the TV don't work at all.

Well, seriously, who watches The Great Northern Cable Network? (Pm 8:30-9) 
Channel 15. It is s0000 cool.

Cable lives.

Ok, since i live in a st.paul suburb I am getting cable last. But what is 
pissing me off is the fact that they are going to rip up $10,000 worth of 
landscaping that my parents put in. Granted they will be putting it back but 
they are not counting growing time it takes to get it back to where it was 
before! Man, what a group of idiots! if they had any* brains they would go 
on the othr side of the street where there is no* houses..

Anyone just getting Cable 

     There's "The Personal Computer Show" on cable, 2-3 times a week. Last time 
I saw it was on a Sunday eve. 9:30. (Rogers Cablesystems, ch.34). They move it 
around a bit, but if you can find it it's pretty interesting at times. It does 
tend to get a little sappy, the hosts look like PM Magazine rejects, but some of
the demos aren't too bad. And, they have a
drawing for a >FREE< computer each month. That makes it worthwhile.

Hiya,

What I need is a working SPECTRUM decoder box that can by-pass all scrambling
modes. Does anyone know where I can get my hands on such a nice little piece 
of equipment?

Do any of the national electronix companies have any that anyone KNOWS that 
works? (like the kind in the back of VIDEO REVIEW etc blah blah blah)

Thanks, -ALX

HOW TO DECODE SPECTRUM VIDEO IS VERY SIMPLE! ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BUILD A 
STABLE FREQUENCY GENERATOR (USING 7555 TIMER CHIP) THAT CAN GENERATE A 
FREQUENCY OF, I BELIEVE, 15,700 HZ. YOU JUST FEED THIS FREQUENCY INTO THE 
HORIZONTAL OSCILLATOR OF YOUR TV, AND YOU HAVE GOT YOURSELF THE VIDEO!

DOES ANYONE OUT THERE KNOW HOW TO UNSCRAMBLE THE CINIMAX SIGNAL PUT OUT BY THE 
COMPANIES, I KNOW IT IS UNSCRAMBLED AT THE HOME AS YOU NEED A SPECIAL BOX TO 
RECIEVE THE CHANLE.

ALSO AS OF RIGHT NOW I HAVE REMOVED THE FILTERS FROM MY CABLE BOX TO ENABLE 
CERTAIN CHANLES TO PASS THROUGH AND ON INTO MY HOUSE, I HAVE FIXED THE FILTERS 
SO THAT THE SIGNAL CAN PASS RIGHT THROUGH THEM, AND THEN RE-INSTALLED THEM, NOW
IF A CABLE MAN COMES BY AND CHECKS IT, EVERY THING WILL LOOK FINE AND DANDY, 
BUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS THERE ANY WAY THEY CAN SIND A ELECTRIC CURRENT 
THROUGH THE LINE AND PICK UP ON MY MODIFIED FILTER???

ANYONE KNOW?
