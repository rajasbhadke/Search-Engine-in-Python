| Introducation |
+---------------+

        GATO is a real-time simulation of a World War II atack submarine. All
objects (ships, island, torpedoes) are tracked simultaneously with an accuracy
greater then one ten thousandth of a unit in an area of 500 million square
units.         "Three Dimensional" object perspective provides depth of field
may evade and flee - or attract the sub - if you are detected.         Each
mission begins with a coded radio message assigning your objective: an enemy
convoy or fleet to intercept, te position of friendly forces needing rescue or
resupply, or a coastal position for landing a spy or commando unit.        
Then, you are shomewhere in your patrol area in the Pacific - and you are on
your own! The success of your mission, and the safety of your submarine and
its crew, are in your hands.         You will navigate the submarine in a
patrol area divided into 20 quadrants, some of which contains islands, as
shown on your Patrol Area Chart and Quadrant Chart screens. Your primary
strategic objective is to efficiently complete as many missions as possible
with the supplies your carry on each patrol. YOu may choose to recieve your
next mission assignment message at any time.          You may set the level of
technical difficulty, and chance will play some small part at critical
moments. But the main factor for the success is the captain's skill operating
and navigating the submarine to achieve mission objectives, using radar,
charts, and all the other realistic GATO-class sub capabilities. You learn and
use the strategic, tactical, and operations skills of a GATO-class submarine
captain to win.         Your record of enemy tonnage sunk is automatically
entered in the Captain's Log and can be saved for future games. It all goes
into your efficiency rating at COMSUBPAC - Commander Submarine Force Pacific
Fleet - If you return from your
mission...

| Operating Information |
+-----------------------+

      +--------------------+
      | Keyboards/Joystick |
      +--------------------+

        Before starting the game, set the Caps Lock key so that all the letters
are in CAPITALS. You only need to press a key once to activate its function.
If you have a joystick hooked up to your computer it will be active
automatically. See Part 1 for keyboard and joystick operating
instructions.


      +---------+
      | Screens |
      +---------+

        There are 3 introductory screens (the title screen, author/copyright   
screen, and main menu), and 9 game screens (date inquiry, game control        
 parameters, mission assignment, main control screen, chart, quadrant, radar, 
  damage, and captain's
log).


Date Inquiry:

        Ships sunk will be logged with the month and day that you enter here.  
The year will always appear as
1943.


Game Control Parameters: (GCP)

        This screen appears after the Date Inquiry; It may also be selected    
during play by pressing the [TAB] key.



1. Level of Difficlty - (0 to 9, 0 = Easiest; 9 = Most Difficult)

Ship Traces show on quadrant charts at difficulty level 5 or lower, and on
patrol area chart only at the levels less then 3. At levels about 7 the Morse
code message is not printed and you can only listen (it helps if you know
Morse
code)

2. Sound On/Off - (1 for shound, 0 for no sound)

3. Time of Day - (1 for day, 0 for night)

4. Player Number - (1 through 4. This is NOT the answer to "How Many Players?"                     but to "Which number player is up next)

        Up to 4 players are allowed - one player at a time. Each player should
be assigned a number (1 through 4). Each time a player completes a mission (or
is sunk), the next player "up" must enter the GCP [TAB] to "log on" his/her
player number. The program then assigns that player a seperate Captain's Log
for tallying
scores.

5. Reset Captain's Log - Erases the scores in the low for whichever number
player is shown in #4. Each player's Captain's Log is automatically reset when
that that player is sunk...it goes down with the
ship.


Mission Assignment:

        Messages are assigned at the beginning of each game or at the request
of the player (press M). A message is "recieved" in Morse code and printed on
your screen on letter at a time as it is being deciphered. Should you perfer
to recieve the message quickly, turn the sound OFF, and the message will
appear on the screen all at
once.


Main Control Screen:

        The main screen shows the submarine instrument panel, with the view
from the bridge or through the periscope. Crosshars will appear when the
periscope is
up.


      +------------------------------+
      | The Instrument Panel Display |
      +------------------------------+

Depth:

        Down to 399 feet, as measured from the sub's deck. The guage stops when
the sub goes beyond this depth (although the radar screen will show acutal
depth reached), and the sub will be crushed due to pressure if depths below
399 are maintained for more then a few
seconds.

Speed:

        Between 0 and 20 knots, or nautical miles, per hour (1 nautical mile -
1.15 land
miles.

Heading:

        Present course in degrees (magnetic compass bearing). the subs
direction is due North at a heading of 0 degrees, due East at 90, due South at
180, and due West at
270.

Fuel:

        Remaining diesel fuel in tons. A flashing light will show when the fuel
level is critically
low.

Batt: 

        Currect charge of batteries for electric motors. A blinking light and
beeping sound indicate when the battery charge is dangerously
low.

Charging:

        A light indicates that the batteries are charging. 

O2:

        Remaining air (breating oxygen), which is used at a constant rate when
the sub is below 20 feet. A triangular pointer slides up and down to show the
amount of air in the
tanks.

Torpedoes:

        The number of torpedoes remaining. A circular light indicates that the
outer torpedo doors are open. Square indicator to the right show shich torpedo
tubes (1 to 4) are ready to be
fired.

Power:

        Shows current mode of propulsion, either ENGINE or BATT, or that the
diesel engines and electric motors are
OFF.

Damage:

        A light indicates that the submarine has sustained damage. When you
sustain new damage a beep will sound. Press the [D] key for a damage
report.


      +----------------------+
      | Submarine Operations |
      +----------------------+

        The submarine itself is run with the controls described below. 

Speed:

        Number keys 1,2,3,4, and 5 set forward speed. 0 stops the engines or
motors. Your actual speed depends upon whether you are using diesel or
electric power, as well as damage conditions and drag from open torpedo doors
and raised periscope. 9 reverses
engines.

Power:

        YOu may switch between electric ([B]attery) and diesel ([E]ngine) power
by pressing the [B and [E] keys. You have a much greater range and speed while
using diesel power, but you cannot run the diesel engines at a depth below 20
feet. If you don't switch to electric power when diving below 20 feet, power
goes off. If that happens, turn on the electric motors, press a speed key, and
center the drive planes.         With each increase in speed, especially when
submerged and under electric power, and even greater increase in drag occurs
and battery or fuel consumption increases dramatically. (Silent running
nderwater is possible only at 1/3, with low noise at 2/3
speed.)

Periscope:

        The [^] and [6] keys send the periscope up and down respectively. When
the scope is up a crosshair appears in the middle of the screen. You can use
the periscope at depths of 0 to 45 feet. You may look in the different
directions, Forward, Port (left), Starboard (Right) and Aft (backward), by
typing the firest letter of each of thses directions. (The scope view is 90
degrees wide and each command turns the scope 90
degrees.

Torpedoes:

        Before firing a torpedo (which is done with the X on the keyboard or
button 0 on the joystick), you must open the outside torpedo doors by pressint
the [T] key. A light indicatesthe doors are open (Your speed will then
diminish slightly due to an increase in drag.) To close the doors press the
[T] key again. (At great depths doors will not open due to pressure.)        
You begin with a supply of 24 torpedoes. After each torpedo is fired the
number in the square indicator disappears and the tupe is temporarily out of
commission until the crew in the torpedo room can reload it. The number
reappears in the square indicating when each of the 4 forward tubes is loaded.
        Torpedoes travel at a speed of 60 knots and can take several seconds to
reach the target, so you must aim ahead of moving ships at long range - and,
of course, the periscope must be turned forward. The vetical crosshair is
aligned on the target by using left or right rudder. (The horizontal crosshair
never moves. It is used for range estimates.)         At low difficulty levels
you will usually sink the enemy ship with one torpedo hit, if not, his speed
and maneuverability will be
reduced.

Oxygen:

        The oxygen supply is used at depths below 20 feet. When you surface and
turn on the diesel engines, the air compressor starts automatically and
refills the tanks within a few
minutes.

Damage Report:

        The sub's damage can be checked by pressing the [D] key ([D]amage). The
affected area will be highlighted in red on the sub diagram and a trouble
light will appear next to the name of the damaged are on a checklist.        
Damaged submarine functions are crippled or rendered useless. There are
certain areas which are more critical than others such as the control room,
torpedo room, or the bridge. When heavy damage accumulates, chances of
survival are slim, and you should return to the subtender for
repairs.


      +------------+
      | Navigation |
      +------------+

        Navigation and game control are accomplished with the following functions.

Radar:

        Radar (the [R] key) shows the relative angle and range between the sub
and other objects such as ships and islands. Ships are tracked as single dots
which move acress the radar screen, and islands are displayed as circles. The
top of the screen shows what is in front of you, what is on the right of the
sub, and so on. The sub's radar has a range approximately 10 percent londer
than that of the periscope or visual sighting from the conning tower. the
radar schope is positioned atop its own mounting tube and may be used to a
maximum depth of 45 feet. To clear the radar schope press the R key. Press the
[Space Bar] or any unused key to return to the main program. (You may fire
torpedoes, dive, or surface while using radar.) Remember, both you and the
other ships may be moving.


Chart of Patrol Area:

        The patrol are chart (the C key) displays your position (in blue dots)
and traces your present course witin the entire patrol area. It is most useful
to see which quadrant you are in and how deep you are into enemy territory, as
well as island posittion and general patrol area geography. the subtender (in
blue) and enemy ships (in red) are also displayed at game difficulty levels
less than 3. Press C again to clear your trace. Press any unused key to return
to the main
screen.

Quadrant of Operations:

        The quadrant chart (The Q key) traces your position an course in the
quadrant where you are currntly located. (Allow at least ten points to be
plotted if you want an accurate course trace.) Subtender and enemy posi|ions
are shown at a game difficulty level of 5 or lower. the position of any island
is alos shown. Shoals and reefs are indicated by a dotted red line. The chart
changes automatically when the sub moves from one quadrant to another. Press Q
agaon to clear your trace. Press any unused key to treturn to the main
screen.

Mission Assignment Messages:

        Pressing the M key brings a new mission assignment message. This is
normally done when your current mission is complete, but you may call for a
new mission at any time. The patrol are will change accordingly.         
Messages are preceded by the leve of classification, and the Date Time Group
(DTG). This DTG gives the day of the month (entered at the beginning of the
game), and Zulu tim (Greenwich Meant Time, Greenwich,
England).

Islands:

        Take care when approaching islands. If you get too close you may run
aground on a shoal. In that event, you will drift free on the tide in a short
time. Reverse engines to back away from the island (hold 9 key down until off
of shoal) before going forward on a new
course


Damage Repair and Resupply:

        When you have accumualated significant damage or are low on supplies,
you should return to the allied subtender, which cruises among four
allied-controlled quadrants (1,2,6, and 7). When you approach, the subtender's
speed will decrease to about 3 knots. Once you are close enough, and parallel
course and speed, damage will be repaired, torpedoes replaced, and fuel tanks
refilled.         Do not shoot your own subtender! YOu will have no way of
resupply, and it will get you in hot water with
COMSUBPAC!!!

Captain's Log:

        Use the L key to display the Captain's Log - the record of each ship
sunk and the toal tonnage accumulated for all the sub's missions since the log
was last cleared. The log is not reset when you begin the game, so you may
continue to play where you last left off (unless you were sunk). You may clear
the Log with the game control. The Log is also cleared when the list of known
enemy ships is exhausted. Press any unused key to return to the main routine.
(The program pauses when you display the
Log.)


      +--------------------+
      | Beginning the Game |
      +--------------------+

        When you have recieved your first mission assignment and have pressed a
key to begin, you will see the main screen with the instruments indicating
full supplies and zero depth, speed, and bearing. You will be in a friendly
quadrant, usually quadrant 7, which you can verify by pressing the [C] key to
view the patrol area chart. The sub and (at difficulty levels less than 3) the
subtender will be plotted as blue dots on the chart. Enemy ships will be
plotted in red (at level 2 or lower).         The patrol are is divided into
20 quadrants. Of these, 1,2,6, and 7 are occupied by allied forces. Quadrants
11 and 16 are relatively nuetral. Enemy ships are not often found there. These
of the are is dominated by the enemy. Your missions are to infiltrate this
region to cut off enemy supply lines, rescue and resupply allied forces, and
perform reconnaissance and espoinage support.         Use the chart to
determine the courese necessary to reach your objective, and use the main
screen display to monitor your use of the controls as you set the sub in
motion on the proper course. Use the charts to track your progress until the
objective is in
view.

        The X coordinate is represented by the 5 Quadrants illustrated at the
botton of the Chart and numbered 0 to 25,000 (from left to right), each
quadrant having a value of 5000. The Y coordinate is represented by the 4
Quadrants illustrated at the left of the Chart and numbered 0 to 20,000 (from
bottom to top), again, each quadrant having a value of 5,000.         You do
not have to tel the system where you are, just where you want to be. For
example, if you are in Quadrant 1 (as seen fromthe Chart screen), and want to
get to the uppter right hand cornder of quadrant 8...press [Z], enter the
password [JYTR] and press [RETURN], enter the X coordinate [14,500], and the Y
coordinate [9,050] (typed in as: 14500,9050), and press [RETURN]. The Chart
will now show you postioned in your new location.         You may choose any
number from 0 to 25,000 for X, and any number from 0 to 20,000 for Y. Numbers
higher than those specified for X and Y will not be accepted; if you make a
mistake the system wil give you another blank field to enter the correct
coordinates. It will take some time to orient yourself on the Chart so keep
experimenting - you'll get it down in no time. Oh yes...if you try to use the
RSD function to escape an enemy who has you spotted with sonar...forget it!
You got yourself into that mess, you'll have to figure a way out of it... the
hard
way.
