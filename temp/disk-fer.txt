                           Disk-fer Terminal Software
                                   Written by

        The main point of this software is to make the world of piracy a whole
lot easier and more efficient of the computers time of disk-space and of YOUR
time.  You need not be presant during the x-fer which can and has lasted up to
1 hour and 10 minutes.  You dont need two extra disks for any ]PARTS or
anything of the sort. Instead you need Disk-fer and a blank disk.

        Operation of Disk-fer is as follows.  When you bootup the program you
might be confronted with one of many things.

1)- It could be in lowercase (if you can't read lowercase) in which case you
    hit 'F' to configure the system.

2)- The slot could be configured wrong in which case you need to hit 'C' to
    change the slot.  If it hangs the system as a result of a bad slot # you
    need to mod the program BEFORE you run it.

    To make this mod from the monitor type:

*905:N0   (where 'N' is the slot #)

if your slot # is 2 then there should be a $20 there.

3)- It comes up Disk-fer with the right slot and all!!!!!!!!!!!


        After you get it configured for your system you should see a bunch of
commands staring back at you!

P)-     Toggles between on hook and off hook. An inverse PHN on the status bar
        will be lit when the cat is online.

V)-     Toggles between MODEM and VOICE mode.  Modem mode will be forced at the
        Begining of a X-fer.  And VOICE mode will be forced at the menu.

C)-     Changes the Apple-cat slot.  An intesesting little thing that happens
        on my computer is that when I change the slot to my printer card and
        the printer is off, the carrier light flashes on and off at the same
        rate as the video circuitry updates the screen. Leaving broken
        characters on the screen.

M)-     Toggles Between ORGINATE and ANSWER mode of the modem.  During a B)oth
        trade the computer to send first is the one that is in ORGINATE at the
        start of the X-fer.

F)-     Reconfigure Disk-fer.  This command is prompted by a message reading
        LOWERCASE (Y/N)... Quite obviously you answer this question Yes or No
        Then it asks you if you want a configured copy saved on disk. the
        configured copy contains the current password of the system and the
        current slot of the apple-cat. Your lowercase status is also saved on
        disk.  The file saved on disk is called 'Disk-fer' and can be BRUN as
        your running copy of the program

D)-     Dos command.  This option allows you to enter a dos command to be
        parsed by the current DOS. (any DOS command can be entered)

E)-     Edit password.  This option edits the current password of the system.
        you may enter lowercase/cntrl/normal chars to be used as your password.
        The password is used to keep unwanted people (Software Underground
        Members) out of your system.

S)-\
R)-+\
B)-++\
L)-+++\
K)-++++\These five options are the Transfer/Recieve options. I will explain how
        use them in general then in detail. When you select one of these
        options the copmuter comes up with 'Enter password :' at this point you
        can either type:

<ESC>   to abort....
<RET>   to transfer when both Apples are in 'local mode' (see below)....
        Hitting return will just jump to the transfer routine that you chose at
        the Menu.

        A two character password entered at this prompt puts the Apple into a

        remote computer.  This option is used to call up a 'Disk-fer BBS' which
        will be waiting for calls to send disks, if of course the two passwords
        match. Those two passwords are:

        The computer that is the 'BBS'
        The password that you type after the command.

                          Sending and receiving files.
                          ------- --- --------- ------

S)-     Send the diskette in drive one. This command MUST be executed along
        with the 'R' command.

R)-     Receive a disk from the lines to drive 1.

B)-     Receive a disk and put it on drive two. And Send the diskette in drive
        two. The order of operations is decided by the ORG/ANS mode. The
        in ORG sends first.

L)-     Lop-sided send.  Send both the disks in both drives.  (Note, to many of
        these X-fers will cause the computer to self-destruct to prevent you
        from being LEACHED upon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

K)-     Lop-sided receive. Receive disks in both drives.  These are the best
        X-fers that the program does!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.

        (Note: if the computer is not in Unattended mode these X-fers will
        'never' abort by themselves. They will just keep hacking away unless
        a sync error occurs and the receive skips a block. These errors are
        possible but not likely.  If the transfer ends on its own. Then you can
        be 98% sure that the disks have been sent correctly.

        When the X-fer ends both sides will wait for you to hit a key.
        the first person to hit a key will be in control of both computers
        He/She (Wo-man's LIB) will be sent a small menu at 300 baud.

B)ell or H)ang up??

        You can either page the owner of the computer with the B)eep option
        or you can H)ang up the other computer so that you can call back
        This menu is nice if your freind wants to go to bed while you download
        the programs in his drives. You can hang up his computer so it won't
        tie up the lines all night.
        At any time during this little menu you can hit escape to enter the
        Main menu.

        (Note: If your computer is in Unattended mode it will not jump to this
        menu. but it will go to wait for another ring.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Unattended Mode
                                ---------- ----
        The Unattended menu is reached by hitting 'U' and it is exited by
hitting 'U' also.  In this menu the fone will never be kept off hook for more
than a second.  When you hit one of the five send/receive commands the computer
comes up:

'Waiting for ring...'
 XX                    (XX is your current password)

        When the computer receives a ring or you hit '+' it will wait 8 seconds
for a carrier. Then it will wait 8 seconds for the correct password to be sent.
If either of these timing requirements is not met then the computer hangs up
and awaits another call.

        If the mode chosen for unattended mode includes a receive mode such as
R, K or B and the apple receives a complete diskette in a drive then it will no
longer await a ring because it would just receive a program on the same disk
that had just been written to.
