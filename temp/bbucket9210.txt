This list contains those BBS in northwestern Oregon that don't fall
within the geographical area  of the Bit Bucket BBS List (Portland, OR),
the Salem BBS List, or any of the other lists that are part of
OBBSLST.TXT. This list is arranged by location rather than name. I
cannot afford the time or money to verify this list regularly, so
each entry contains a "Status" field showing the most current information.
