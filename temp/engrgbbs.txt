The Computer Plumber BBS is pleased to present the following
directory of Engineering Oriented Bulletin Board Systems.

This list contains some of the bulletin board systems which
may be of interest to you.  If you know of a bulletin board
system that is strong on engineering or scientific subjects or
have more information on those listed, please leave a comment
to the sysop on The Computer Plumber BBS at 319-337-6723.

There are many different types of Engineering Bulletin Boards,
just as there are many different types of engineers.

There are three types of boards listed in this directory:
   - Engineering-related BBSs,
   - Product support boards, and
   - Other BBS resources of use to engineers.

BBS entries below marked with an asterisk (*) do not yet
have a description included with this directory.
