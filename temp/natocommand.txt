
NATO COMMANDER (War Strategy Game for 1 or 2 players)
Compatible: 64K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, KB input, joystick optional


     Barely a week after being sworn in as NATO's new commander you begin to receive some very disturbing reports from East Germany. The situation quickly escalates as workers take to the streets, rumors of "reunification talks" surface, and Warsaw Pact forces crunch toward the frontier. This time the Russians really are coming!

     In "NATO Commander" your task is to slow the WP advance until the West's air superiority and reserves can turn the tide. Eight unit types ranging from mechanized infantry through tactical nukes, and control down to the brigade level offer numerous options. However, these soon shrink to a precious few once the political importance of cities, the need to protect SAM and air bases, and the strategic significance of the "Fulda Gap" are assessed.

     A scrolling situation map displays major terrain features, NATO and WP forces, and important cities. It is also the medium, via a cursor, for issuing orders to selected units. Incidently, since combats are resolved on an on-going basis, if you do nothing the WP will simply march across the map.

     Smooth running and easy to play, "NATO Commander" is, none the less, very challenging. If you've ever considered trying a wargame, but wanted something you could really 'get your teeth into; this is the one to go for.
