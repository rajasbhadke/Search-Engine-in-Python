default accounts: sysop/sysop & test/test
if the system is running Mutants Link, there is an account ML pw: !@*&#@&AY.

the password file is c:\bbsv6\bbsusr.dat min most cases.  If you can get 
the sysop to give you forum op access, you can attach this file to a 
message, and download it  Another trick is if you are a forum op, you can 
setup a chargew for posting a message.  Make it -32000 credits.  Then 
post a few messages.  Eeach time you will GET 32000 credits.  Then just 
erase your messages and set it back to no chrage for a message, and there 
is no log of you getting the credits.

Another trick, if you decide to brute force hack, always hang up after 2 
attempts.  On the 3rd attempt, it will log the hack attempt to the audit 
trail.  Just try twice, then hang up, and call back.  No problem.
