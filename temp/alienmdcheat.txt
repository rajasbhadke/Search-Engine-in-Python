Okay, save your game on your character disk. The main data block for position one is $0004. The rest of the positions continue in block increments of 4 (i.e. position 2 is at $0008, position 3 is at $000C, etc).

Okay, find your position on the disk w/ a block editor.

Number of Cartridges: Byte $010 & $011
Energy: Byte $00A & $00B
Key Cards: Byte $008 & $009
Level: Byte $022

The way the data is stored is very odd since that if you use certain numbers, your guy will die. For example, if you use $FFFF (65535) for your energy, your man will die after one hit. Strange? I have found lower values to work. Using $4360 (17248) seems 
to work. Or you could try $270F (9999). I dunno.

You must edit the values in reverse order.
        Example: To make your energy 17248, take the hex equivalent, $4360 (or $43 60), take the last byte and place it before the first to get $60 43. These bytes should go at $00A and $00B, respectively.

There are only four digits allowed for key cards. If you try to edit the key cards to 17248, A.M. will take the rightmost four digits and you will see 7248.

To change the level, simply place the respective level number at byte $022.
