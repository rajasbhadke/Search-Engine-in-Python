TO LOAD THE GAME:

The following instructions will help you as you investigate THE CASE OF THE
MANDARIN MURDER. It is particularly important to make a Save Disk so that you
can save your game. To do this, follow the instructions under "Create" as soon
as you boot PERRY MASON.

NEWDATA:

Enter NEWDATA when you first load the game to obtain any instructions that may
have changed since the publication of this textfile.

CREATE:

Note: The program will erase the contents of any disk created as a Save Disk.

The create command will create a Save Disk, which will enable you to save at
any point in the game. You must create a Save Disk before you can save a game.
This point should be done as soon as you boot PERRY MASON. To do this:

     1. Enter CREATE. Follow all the instructions on the screen.
     2. The words "CREATE complete" will appear when the Save Disk is ready.
     3. Remove the Save Disk and replace the game disk in the drive.

SAVE:

You can save at any point in the game, and restore to that point later on. To
save a game:

     1. Enter SAVE
     2. Follow all instructions on the screen (you can type up to 30 characters
        identifying your location when you save).

When the save is complete, you may continue investigating your case.

RESTORE:

You can restore to any point you have saved on the Save Disk at any time during
the game. To do so:

     1. Enter RESTORE.
     2. Follow all instructions on the screen. PERRY will resume from the point
        you selected, and you can continue your game.

Note: If you change your mind after typing CREATE, SAVE, or RESTORE, type "*"
      to cancel the command.

                         STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*


OBJECTIVE:

Your primary objective is to gain an acquittal for your client; secondarily,
you should try to bring the real murderer to justice. Bear in mind that you
must remain conscious of your client's best interests at all times. Novice
defense lawyers often let damaging evidence against their client slip into the
court record when they mistakenly concentrate on convicting the real criminal.

USING PAUL AND DELLA:

Be selective about what you send Paul to investigate, as each job takes time.
Also be aware of Della's limitations. She is too busy to take shorthand notes
during the trial, so you should take notes of the significant details which
come up during direct and cross-examination yourself.

Use Paul to investigate places or people which make use of his detective
skills. Della is more helpful in sticky personal matters. She is especially
good at persuading reluctant people to submit depositions on the defense's
behalf.

DIRECT EXAMINATION STRATEGIES:

Do not be afraid to object to a question when you belive the answer will
present evidence damaging to your client and there exists grounds for the
objection. Remember, however, that objections are interruptive, and are often
perceived by juries as attempts to withhold evidence from the court. Use your
discretion in deciding not only when to object, but also in determining the
proper legal grounds for objection.

CROSS-EXAMINATION STRATEGIES:

The following are a few questions to help you decide whether or not to cross-
examine a witness:

     Has the witness hurt your case?

     Was the witness' testimony believable?

     What do you expect to get out of the cross?

     What is the risk involved if other damaging evidence surfaces?

Consider both the incriminating evidence brought forth by a witness and the
witness' believability. If both factors rate high, then consider the amount of
ammunition you have to crack the witness' testimony. What is the risk involved?
Do you stand to gain or lose in the cross-examination? Be careful with expert
witnesses. Questioning them too harshly will not assist the defense of your
client.

INTRODUCING EVIDENCE STRATEGIES:

Introducing key items into evidence will greatly assist the defense of your
client. Remember, however, to introduce each item at the appropriate moment.
The following may be a useful step-by-step guide to cracking a witness:

     1. Ask a question which you know will provoke a dishonest response from
        the witness.

     2. Introduce a key item into evidence which discredits the witness'
        testimony.

     3. Show that item to the witness. If you simply show the item to the
        witness before provoking a dishonest response, you lose an opportunity
        to force the witness into making contradictory statements, which scores
        points with the jury. Remember, however, that not all witnesses can be
        cracked. Attempting to discredit some witnesses - especially expert
        witnesses - will anger the jury and discredit your defense.

*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*


PAUL DRAKE:

Paul Drake is a top-notch detective, experienced in investigating nearly any
situation, no matter how dangerous or complex. If at any time you would like a
report on a certain character or place, type PAUL, followed by a comma, and
then INVESTIGATE, followed by the name of the character or place. For example:

     PAUL, INVESTIGATE VICTOR KAPP or
     PAUL, INVESTIGATE THE MANDARIN RESTURANT

While Paul is out investigating, continue pressing your case. Paul will return
with his report when he has completed his examination.

DELLA STREET:

Della Street is a highly skilled legal assistant, available to assist you in
any telephone investigation you deem necessary. Once in the courtroom, Della
can also summarize topics covered in the direct examination.

To ask Della to telephone a character or place, type DELLA, followed by a
comma, and then CALL, followed by a person or a place. For example:

     DELLA, CALL JANE WINSLOW or
     DELLA CALL DR. ERICHSON

Continue presenting your case until Della returns with the report from the
phone call.

To ask Della to summarize the direct examination of a witness, type:

     DELLA, SUMMARIZE

Della will then summarize the topics covered by the prosecution for your use
during your cross-examination.

To ask Della to assist you in formulating a cross-examination strategy, type:

     DELLA, TIP

Della will then suggest a brief strategy for approaching the witness currently
under cross-examination. She will also include a list of questions which you
may ask the witness.

                           THE DIRECT EXAMINATION

*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*


During the direct examination the prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Burger, will
call a witness to the stand for questioning. You, as defense attorney Perry
Mason, can either object to Burger's questions or allow the witness to answer.
Either choice will carry weight in determining the outcome of the trial.

DIRECT EXAMINATION PROCEDURES:

Following the text in which Hamilton Burger calls his witness to the stand, or
following a witness' answer to a question, *** will appear. Press any key to
continue. Burger will then ask a question. When the cursor appears, you can
either object to the question by typing:

     OBJ or OBJECTION

or allow the witness to continue by typing:

     ANSWER OR LISTEN

Answer can be abbreviated to A.

Type REPEAT at any time during the direct examination to get Burger's last
question to reappear on the screen.

To enter commands such as:

     SAVE, RESTORE or EXAMINE

type the command when the cursor appears, as you would at any other point in
the game. Some commands will cause the last question Burger asked to scroll off
the screen.

OBJECTING TO HAMILTON BURGER'S QUESTIONS:

If you type OBJ or OBJECTION, Judge Northrup will either overrule your
objection, or ask you to state the grounds for the objection. Permissible
grounds for objecting are as follows:

- IRRELEVANT      (Question is irrelevant). Use this objection when you believe
                  Burger's question asks for evidence that would have no
                  bearing on the trial. For example: JULIAN, WHERE WERE YOU
                  BORN?

- HEARSAY         (Question asks for hearsay). Use this objection when you
                  believe the question asks for evidence based on a statement
                  made by someone other than the defendant, and is beyond the
                  witness' direct experience. The statement may be oral,
                  written, or non-verbal conduct. For example: JULIAN, DID
                  MARGOT TELL VICTOR ABOUT THE GUN?

- LEADING         (Question is leading the witness). Use this objection when
                  you believe the question suggests a specific answer. For
                  example: JULIAN, DID THE DEFENDANT STEAL THE MONEY?

- OPINION         Use this objection when you believe the witness does not
                  possess the necessary expertise to answer the question. Only
                  witnesses who qualify as experts may offer opinions in court,
                  and they may only offer opinions in their areas of expertise.
                  For example: COULD ANYONE FIRE THE GUN FROM CLOSE RANGE? is a
                  question which could only be asked of ballistics expert Bill
                  Dorset, as it concerns his area of expertise. This objection
                  may also be used when you believe the witness' answer cannot
                  be substantiated by facts. For example: SUZANNE, DID VICTOR
                  LOVE LAURA?

- UNQUALIFIED     Use this objection when the question asks for a fact, but the
                  witness is unqualified to give the information. Note that
                  this objection differs from the opinion objection in that it
                  concerns witnesses offering factual information in an area
                  outside of their expertise, while the opinion objection
                  concerns witnesses offering opinions in areas outside their
                  expertise. For example: BURNS, DID THE GUN KILL VICTOR?

- BROWBEATING     Use this objection when you believe Burger is intimidating
                  the witness or using unseemly conduct. Often browbeating
                  arises from a series of intimidating questions designed to
                  make the witness suffer emotional stress. For example:
                  MILLER, DIDN'T YOU DESPISE THE VICTIM?

                           THE CROSS EXAMINATION

*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*


After Hamilton Burger has finished questioning a witness in the direct
examination, you will have the opportunity to cross-examine the witness. During
the cross-examination, you may ask any question that pertains to the subject
matter introduced during the direct. If you ask a question outside of the
subject matter covered in the direct examination, Burger will object, and you
will have to withdraw your question.

CROSS EXAMINATION PROCEDURES:

At the end of the direct examination, Hamilton Burger will signal that he is
finished questioning: YOUR WITNESS, COUNSELOR. When the cursor appears, you may
begin your cross-examination by typing in a question. If there are no
objections to your question, the witness' answer will automatically follow your
question. Hamilton Burger objects to your question and the objection is
sustained, your question will be withdrawn and the witness will not answer.

When the cursor appears, proceed to your next question. You may continue to ask
as many questions as you like, until you decide that you have gotten all
possible evidence in favor of your client, without introducing evidence that
may damage her case.

To restate your previous question, and therefore press a witness for the truth,
type:

     REPEAT or CONTINUE

at any time during the cross. To end the cross-examination, type:

     END or NO FURTHER QUESTIONS

The witness will step down from the stand, and Burger will call his next
witness.

INTRODUCING EVIDENCE INTO COURT:

To introduce an item from your inventory into evidence, type:

     INTRODUCE <an item> AS EVIDENCE

For example:

     INTRODUCE THE CIGARETTE AS EVIDENCE

USING EVIDENCE:

To use the evidence to make a point in the courtroom, type:

     GIVE or SHOW <item of evidence> to <witness>

For example:

     GIVE THE CIGARETTE TO MARGOT

LISTING ALL OBJECTS ENTERED IN EVIDENCE:

The command EXAMINE EVIDENCE will give you a list of the objects in evidence.

Occasionally you may wish to adopt certain poses and change the expression on

do so, type:

You may also:

     STAND, SIT, FACE, WHIRL TOWARDS, etc. <jury, witness, judge, prosecution,
                                            or courtroom>

The following chart will assist you in solving THE CASE OF THE MANDARIN MURDER.
When questioning witnesses you must phrase your questions in the format
outlined in the chart (chose one from each column):

As the chart illustrates, when phrasing your questions you must choose from all
the words listed in columns A, B, and C (Each of these three columns contain
ALL the possible words you may use). The possible verbs (column D) and object
phrases (column E) are listed in the word list. Additional rules:

1. The first time you address someone, you must begin your question with his or
   her name, followed by a comma. For instance, you might begin your
   interrogation of Burns by asking:

     BURNS, WHAT IS YOUR OCCUPATION?

If you instead typed

     BURNS WHAT IS YOUR OCCUPATION?

your question would not be understood by the game. After you have addressed the
character once, it is not necessary to address him or her again until you wish
to speak to a new character. For instance, the next question directed to Burns
might be:

     HOW MANY GUESTS ENTERED THE BUILDING?

2. You may use one prepositional phrase in column E. For instance, you may say:

     DID YOU STUDY BALLISTICS IN SCOOL?

You may not, however, use more than one prepositional phrase. For instance:

     DID YOU GO TO THE APARTMENT ON FRIDAY NIGHT?

would not be understood by the game.

3. Use single verbs in column D. For instance:

     COULD MARGOT KILL VICTOR?

is an acceptable sentence. Compound verbs, however, should not be used. For
instance,

     COULD MARGOT HAVE KILLED VICTOR?

would not be understood by the game.

4. You may use the first name, last name, or both first and last names of the
   subjects in column C. Please note, however, that the subjects in column C
   are the only subjects which may be used.

5. Here are the only exceptions to the above rules:

You may type:

     DESCRIBE <the object>
     EXAMINE <the object>
     TAKE <the object>
     GO TO <the object>
     PAUL, INVESTIGATE <the object>
     DELLA, CALL <the object>
     DELLA, SUMMARIZE
     DELLA, TIP
     SURR
     INVENTORY

NOTE: Column C may contain any character or piece of evidence. Column D may

                APPENDIX B - BUILDING SENTANCES WITH THE CHART

*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*:-:*

1. Choose a question phrase from column A and column B:

     WHEN DID
     COULD
     WHO WERE
     WHAT WAS
     HOW MANY

2. Choose a subject from column C:

     THE DOG
     CROSSMAN
     THE DOCUMENT

3. Choose one verb from column D:

     LOOK
     TAKE
     ADMIT

4. If needed, construct a phrase for column E:

     - Find a noun on the noun list
       APARTMENT   GUN   ARGOS

     - If needed, find an adjective from the adjective list
       LAURA'S   BROKEN   FRIDAY

     - Choose one preposition from the preposition list
       TO   IN   AT

     These can be combined into an object phrase
       ON THURSDAY NIGHT
       IN VICTOR'S APARTMENT
       THE GUN


     DID YOU GO INTO THE APARTMENT ON FRIDAY NIGHT? would not work as the
sentence contains two prepositions from the preposition list.

     DID YOU ENTER THE APARTMENT ON FRIDAY NIGHT? would work. Note that the
second sentence replaces a verb and a preposition (GO and INTO) with a single
verb (ENTER).

     HOW MANY GUESTS SIGNED-IN ON FRIDAY? would not work, as signed-in is a two
word verb. Remember that two word verbs and compound verbs (like WERE TAKEN)
are not understood by the game. Only single verbs from the verb list are
accepted.

     HOW MANY GUESTS REGISTERED ON FRIDAY? would work. Note that the second
sentence replaces a two word verb (SIGNED-IN) with a single word verb
(REGISTERED).

     WAS THE FRONT DOOR UNLOCKED would not work, as UNLOCKED is not one of the
adjectives listed on the adjective list.

     Resort to the describe command: DESCRIBE THE FRONT DOOR. This would work.
If you want information about a particular topic (the front door, the statue,
the gun, etc.) the DESCRIBE command is especially useful. Instead of asking for
specific information about a particular topic (WAS THE GUN LOADED, WAS THE
STATUE PURPLE) ask for general information about the topic using the DESCRIBE
command. In most instances, this will prompt the witness to tell you all he or
she knows about the topic.

Perry -

Here is some information I dug up for the Kapp case. These are all the
important people involved as far as I can tell. If you ask me, Victor Kapp was
a real snake, with enough enemies to fill up Dodger Stadium. If you need
anything else, you know where you can find me.                          -Paul

LAURA KAPP - released from the institution only to find her world turned upside
             down.

VICTOR KAPP - The dead restauranteur. I guess he got stiffed for the last time,
              huh Perry!!

SERGEANT HOLCOMB - Mr. Long Arm of the Law himself. He'd rather arrest you than
                   the murderer any day!

RUSSELL MILLER - the resturant critic who finds himself in an occasional cash
                 bind. I don't like him. What a wimp!

JULIAN MASTERS - His money made Victor's dreams come true. My operatives tell
                 me Victor didn't need him for the Mandarin. I wonder why?

SUZANNE MASTERS - Julian's wife and Laura's friend, a kept woman who's keeping
                  a few secrets of her own.

ED BURNS - door man at St. James Apartments

MARGOT DUBOQ - What a curvy little croissant!! Who knows what her relationship
               with Victor was all about? A slippery one, Chief!

BILL DORSET - police ballistics expert - a good man.

JACK CROSSMAN - medical examiner - tops in his field.

LT. TRAGG - Chief of Homicide. He may work for the prosecution, but I know he
            likes and respects you.

The Argos Cafe - 1330 La Brea Ave.

                                ONE STAR
                          (our lowest rating)

     The Argos Cafe is restauranteur Victor Kapp's latest attempt to ingratiate
himself with Los Angeles society. It features "Greek-Italian specialties" -
whatever that may be - and a sixty page wine list almost as exclusive in its
selections as the Sacramento telephone book. And the food! Have you ever seen
moussaka spumoni on any menu, anywhere? Or bahklava torellini? I finally
settled on a feta cheese lasagne, which didn't arrive for an hour, and by that
time I'd drunk so many kirs that I barely noticed when one of the waiters
spilled gazpacho all over my tie. I vaguely remember that the lasagne was baked
to the consistency of a man's shoe. A very fine shoe, mind you, reminiscent of
Italian leather, but a shoe nonetheless. So if you're in the market for a new
pair of oxfords, by all means, try the Argos; if you're an investigator for the
ASPCA, the Argos kitchen is probably hiding something you should know about,
but if you're looking for a meal stay as far away from 1330 La Brea Avenue as
you possibly can.

Good Morning! Rumor has it that heiress Alexis Chandler has finally agreed to tie the knot with Latin Lover Roman Romaine ... by the way, where did film star Colleen Gaughan find that perfectly awful hat she's been sporting? Tres tacky Colleen, but unfortunately entirely in character ... V.K. spotted last night at the Bradford Ballroom with M.D. ... I wonder if L. knows, the poor dear...or (gulp!) J.M., that grptesque beast ... say, does anyone care anymore about Liz and Dic, or am I the only one left ...
