         THE INSPECTOR SOFTDOC
         ---------------------
    BROUGHT TO YOU BY DR. ELECTRIC

              **********

THIS SOFTDOC IS BASED ON THE SOFTWARE
VERSION OF THE INSPECTOR FOR THE
APPLE II+.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
-------------------

THE INSPECTOR IS A SIMPLE TO USE
UTILITY WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO EXAMINE AND
EDIT DATA THAT IS EITHER IN THE APPLE'S
MEMORY OR ON 3.3 DISKS. ACCORDING TO
THE INSTRUCTIONS YOU CAN ALSO EDIT DATA
ON DISKS WITH A NON-STANDARD DOS, BUT
IN MOST SOFTWARE WITH NONSTANDARD
SECTOR SIZES THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

APPLE II+
16K RAM CARD W/INTBASIC LOADED
1 DISK DRIVE

ACCESSING THE INSPECTOR
-----------------------

TO GET TO THE INSPECTOR, YOU MUST DO
THE FOLLOWING (AFTER IT'S LOADED):

1) CALL-151
2) TYPE 'C080' THEN C/R,
3) TYPE 'D800G' AND YOU'RE IN.

INSPECTOR DISK COMMANDS
-----------------------

<V> = DOS VERSION

SELECTS THE DOS VERSION TO MATCH THE
VERSION YOU ARE USING ON THE DISK.
YOU CAN TOGGLE BETWEEN 13 AND 16 SECTOR
DOS.

<P> = PERIPHERAL SLOT

SELECTS THE SLOT YOUR DISK CONTROLLER
IS IN.

<D> = DRIVE NUMBER

TOGGLES BETWEEN 1 AND 2.

<T> = TRACK

SELECTS TRACK # TO BE READ. PRESS 'T'
THEN NUMBER TO READ AND C/R.

<S> = SECTOR

SELECTS SECTOR # TO BE READ. PRESS 'S'
THEN NUMBER TO READ AND C/R.

NOTE: ALL TRACK, SECTOR AND BUFFER INFO
MUST BE ENTERED IN HEXADECIMAL.

<R> = READ

CAUSES PROGRAM TO READ SPECIFIED TRACK
AND SECTOR. ANY ERRORS ENCOUNTERED ARE
DISPLAYED IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND PART
OF SCREEN.

<;> = SCAN FORWARD

CAUSES PROGRAM TO READ NEXT SECTOR.

<-> = SCAN BACKWARD

CAUSES PROGRAM TO READ PREVIOUS SECTOR.

<A> = ASCII/HEX DISPLAY

TOGGLES BETWEEN ASCII AND HEX DISPLAY.

<X> = E(X)CHANGE

EXCHANGES FLASHING AND INVERSE WITH
NORMAL ASCII CHARACTERS. AN ENTIRE
SCREEN OF FLASING '@'S GETS HARD TO
READ, SO THIS COMMANDS ACTS AS A GOOD
FILTER.

<E> = EDIT

SELECTS THE EDIT MODE SO CHANGE, INSERT
OR DELETE INFORMATION IN MEMORY FROM
EITHER THE HEX OR ASCII DISPLAY MODE.

FOR HEX NOTATION USE AS FOLLOWS:

1) TYPE 'E' TO GET INTO EDIT MODE.
2) TYPE THE # OF BYTE LOCATION YOU WANT
   TO CHANGE.
3) TYPE <SPACE>. THE CONTENTS OF THAT
   LOCATION WILL BE DISPLAYED.
4) TYPE IN THE NEW DATA.
5) HIT C/R.
6) TO KEEP EDITING SUCCESSIVE BYTES,
   KEEP PRESSING <SPACE> INSTEAD OF
   RETURN.

FOR ASCII NOTATION USE AS FOLLOWS:

1) TYPE 'E' TO GET INTO EDIT MODE.
2) TYPE BYTE LOCATION TO BE CHANGED.
3) TYPE 'L' IF YOU WANT TO INSERT LOWER
   CASE OR TYPE 'N' IF YOU WANT TO
   INSERT NEGATIVE ASCII (FLASHING) OR
   THE SPACEBAR FOR NORMAL ASCII.
4) ENTER THE ASCII STRING INTO THE
   DESIRED LOCATIONS.
5) RETURN TO EXIT EDIT MODE.

<CTRL-W> = WRITE

WRITES DATA IN BUFFER TO TRACK AND
SECTOR SPECIFIED.

<B> = BUFFER LOCATION

SELECTS STARTING DATA BUFFER LOCATION.
I.E. IF BUFFER IS SET TO $0800, THEN
DATA READ FROM DISK WILL BE STORED AT
$800-$8FF. TO SELECT BUFFER, DO THE
FOLLOWING:

1) PRESS 'B' TO SELECT BUFFER MODE.
2) SELECT BUFFER PAGE YOU WISH TO SEE.
3) HIT C/R AND DISPLAY WILL SHOW
   CONTENTS OF THIS BUFFER. INSPECTOR
   WILL NOW USE THIS ADDRESS TO READ
   AND WRITE FROM.

NOTE:READING DATA INTO BUFFER $0000
WOULD HAVE UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS... SO
THE READ AND MAP COMMANDS ARE DISABLED
WHEN THIS BUFFER IS SELECTED.

<CTRL-I> = INCREMENT SECTOR & BUFFER

INCREMENTS SECTOR AND BUFFER AT THE
SAME TIME. GOOD FOR READING A LOT OF
SECTORS AT ONCE.

<M> = MAP

TRACK $11, SECTOR $00 WILL BE READ.
THIS CONTAINS THE VTOC (VOLUME TABLE OF
CONTENTS). A SECTOR MAP WILL THEN BE
DISPLAYED SHOWING ANY USED OR UNUSED
SECTORS ON THE DISK.
         '-' UNUSED SECTOR
         '#' USED SECTOR

<N> = NIBBLE READ

SELECTS NIBBLE READ MODE WHICH IS MADE
UP OF TWO FUNCTIONS:
      1) GRAPHICS DISPLAY
      2) NIBBLE DISPLAY MODE
TO ACCESS THIS FUNCTION, DO THE
FOLLOWING:

1) PRESS 'N' TO GET INTO NIBBLE MODE.
   THE TRACK WILL BE READ AND IN A
   SECOND YOU'LL SEE A GRAPHICS DISPLAY
   OF THE TRACK NIBBLES. THIS MIGHT
   LOOK CONFUSING AT FIRST, BUT SOON
   YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL APART 13 AND
   16 SECTOR DISKS. SELF-SYNC BYTES ARE
   SHOWN AS HORIZONTAL WHITE LINES-
   SINCE 13 SECTOR DISKS HAVE MORE SYNC
   BYTES, THERE WILL BE MORE LINES.
2) HIT C/R, AND YOU'LL SEE A NIBBLE
   DUMP. YOU CAN SCROLL BACKWARDS
   BY HITTING SPACE TO STOP, THEN THE
   LEFT ARROW KEY. PRESSING 'Q' WILL
   TOGGLE BETWEEN FAST AND SLOW DISPLAY
   SPEED. HIT C/R TO EXIT NIBBLE MODE.

<^> = READ NIBBLE FOR NEXT TRACK

SAME AS <N> BUT INCREMENTS SECTOR
FIRST.

MEMORY COMMANDS
---------------

<H> = HEX/ASCII DUMP

DISPLAYS THE HEX/ASCII INFORMATION THAT
IS IN MEMORY.

1) PRESS 'B' TO SELECT BUFFER MODE.
2) SELECT BUFFER TO VIEW.
3) PRESS 'H' FOR HEX/ASCII DUMP.

YOU CAN THEN PRESS ANY KEY TO
STOP/START SCROLLING, 'Q' TO TOGGLE
BETWEEN FAST AND SLOW SCROLLING, OR GO
BACKWARDS BY STOPPING THE DISPLAY THEN
LEFT ARROW. C/R TO EXIT THIS MODE.

<F> = FIND

SELECTS FIND ROUTINE. THIS COMMAND
ALLOWS YOU TO SEARCH ALL OF MEMORY FOR
EITHER A HEX OR ASCII STRING. TO USE:

1) PRESS 'B' FOR BUFFER MODE.
2) SET BUFFER TO $0000.
3) SELECT EITHER HEX OR ASCII DISPLAY
   BY PRESSING 'A'.
SUPPOSE YOU WANT TO FIND THE STRING
'HELLO'.
4) PRESS 'E' FOR EDIT MODE.
5) ENTER LENGTH OF STRING IN BYTE $00.
   IN THIS EXAMPLE, 5.
6) ENTER STRING TO SEARCH FOR STARTING
   AT BYTE $01. IN THIS EXAMPLE,
   'HELLO'.
7) TYPE 'F' TO START THE FIND ROUTINE.

ALL LOCATIONS WHERE 'HELLO' IS FOUND
WILL BE DISPLAYED. ANY KEY WILL STOP/
START LIST. MAX LENGTH OF STING IS 9
BYTES ASCII, $0F BYTES HEX.

WARNING: DO NOT CHANGE ANY BYTES IN
BUFFER $0000 ABOVE BYTE $0F. THE APPLE
USES THIS MEMORY FOR IT'S OWN POINTERS.

<L> = LOCATE

LOCATE IS VERY SIMILAR TO <F>, EXCEPT
IT IS USED FOR FINDING STRINGS ON DISK.
TO USE:

FOLLOW THE SAME PROCEDURE AS IN <F>,
BUT TYPE 'L' INSTEAD OF 'F'. A FLASHING
'L' WILL APPEAR TO THE RIGHT OF THE
DRIVE NUMBER. WHEN A SECTOR IS FOUND TO
CONTAIN THE STRING, THE APPLE WILL
BEEP. PRESSING 'L' WILL TOGGLE THE
LOCATE MODE ON AND OFF.

MISC. COMMANDS
--------------

<CTRL-Z> = USER COMMAND

THIS COMMAND IS INCLUDED SO THAT YOU
CAN UTILIZE YOUR OWN SUBROUTINES. WHEN
PRESSED, IT CAUSES A JUMP TO $0300. ANY
SUBROUTINE CAN BE LOCATED HERE, A
SCREENDUMP FOR INSTANCE. A SHORT
SCREENDUMP ROUTINE WILL BE SHOWN AT THE
END OF THIS SOFTDOC.

<CTRL-C> = RETURN TO BASIC

THIS RETURNS THE SYSTEM TO BASIC.
