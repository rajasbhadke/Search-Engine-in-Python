THE PROMISE OF PLENTITUDE

I have fucked
         bankers minister's sons poets bricklayers train drivers anarchists 	
            teachers cops accountants insurance agents junkies socialists
                in love
                  in passion
                    in hatred
         photographers schoolgirls schoolboys builders hippies dancers
            busdrivers speedfreaks musicians gamblers dreamers	
                out of boredom and despair
                   out of curiosity and companionship
         footballers astrologists socialworkers tram conductors nurses 	
            electricians glassfitters alcoholics publicservants dealers
                for fun
                  for drugs
                    for revenge
                      for control
         surfers computer operators actors activists stockbrokers witches 	
            intellectuals pranksters shopassistants writers and criminals
                out of loneliness
                out of necessity
                out of desire

But I've not yet fucked a judge up the arse with a dildo.
