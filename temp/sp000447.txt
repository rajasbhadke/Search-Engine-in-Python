     * In  last week of July MAGATE specialists was working in
Ministry on  the   Environmental   Protection   and   Regional
Development of  the Republic of Latvia.  They help to organize
governmental control  system  for  transport  of   radioaktive
materials, also  Latvia will receive about 200-300.000 USD for
it.
     * Polish-Russian  border  (Mamonovo 1) will expand by the
end of autumn 1994. Before this time Mamonovo 1 was opened for
Polish and Kaliningrad citizens only. After the expansion all
russians will be use this punkt.  In perspective,  Mamonovo  1
will be  the punkt of expensive new road project "Via Baltica"
which will  go  from   Berlin   to   Kaliningrad,   Riga   and
St.Petersburg.
     * Experts  of  International  Monetary   Fund   work   in
Lithuania from  last week of July'94.  The visit of IMF is in
the plan of 17-monthes IMF program in Lithuania,  also experts
work on  the  project of new economical memorandum between IMF
and Lithuania.  Possibly,  the memorandum will work  from  the
beginning of 1995.

FIELD TRIPS
* Lower Elbe:  A combined long-boat and bus trip during  which
some ecological  problems of the Lower Elbe will be explained,
local conservation areas and their management  plans  will  be
illustrated. * Nature Conservation Area Haseldorfer Binnenelbe
including the Elbe Foothills:  The  nature  conservation  site
belongs  to the "Important Bird Area Pinneberg - Elbmarschen".
Following  the  controversial   dyke   construction   on   the
Haseldorfer   and   Wedeler   Marsh,  it  was  promoted  as  a
conservation site of national importance, now to be maintained
and developed as a wetland area. * Hamburg Wadden Sea National
Park / Neuwerk Island: The marsh island Neuwerk is part of the
Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park.  Extensive salt-flats spread
out from the island's central point (which is surrounded by  a
dyke);  the western part of the island is a protected area for
birds and is managed by the  "Verein  Jordsand".  *  The  Elbe
above  Geesthacht:  Above  Geesthacht through to the border of
Czechoslovakia, the Elbe remains one of the least restructured
rivers  in Europe.  Thus just as major comprehensive plans are
afoot  to  revitalise  and  protect  the  river,  wide-ranging
widening  and extension plans also exist.  Hence the future of
the Elbe remains unknown.

                    IPPNW PRESS-RELEASE

Physicians demand the immediate elimination of nuclear weapons

Berlin, In  memory  of  the  49th  anniversary  of  the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,  the German Section of  the
The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War
(IPPNW) call on the nuclear powers to  finally  eliminate  the
48,000  nuclear weapons still in existence,  with an explosive
power eqivalent to 900,000 Hiroshima  Bombs.  Michael  Roelen,
Executive director of IPPNW Germany states: "Either we get rid
of nuclear weapons or they will get  rid  of  us".  In  Europe
alone, including the American bases in Germany, there are more
than 700 American nuclear warheads, as well as a secret number
of French and British.  Since the first nuclear test "Trinity"
on July 16th 1945 in Alamorgodo in the desert of  New  Mexico,
the  five  nuclear powers - USA,  the United Kingdom,  France,
China and the former USSR - have conducted 1,936 nuclear tests
over  49 years,  in the atmosphere and underground.  The total
explosive power of all tests up to now is equivalent to over 1
billion tons of TNT. These tests spread radioactivity all over
the globe that will continue to exist for  many  thousands  of
years.  These  and  other  radionuclides  create  great health
problems.  According to  IPPNW  estimates,  the  radioactivity
breathed  in by humans will have produced 430,000 fatal cancer
cases by the end of the century.  If the next century is added
on then the sum rises to 2.4 million. Nuclear tests are a sign
of contempt for health and  the  environment.  From  a  health
point of view,  the worst affected have been minorities, rural
people;  people  deprived  of  their   rights,   because   the
government  wanted  to erect their testing facilities on their
land.  The International  Physicians  for  the  Prevention  of
Nuclear War supports the initiative of member countries of the
WHO and the UN to ask the International Court  of  Justice  to
declare  nuclear  weapons illegal.  The physicians call on all
the member states of WHO and UN to adopt this initiative.  The
Executive  Director of IPPNW Germany states:  "It is now time,
49 years since the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that the
people  force  the  nuclear  powers  to  reduce  their nuclear
arsenals to zero."

           14th INTERNATIONAL COASTAL DAY 1994

"WATER BETWEEN LAND AND SEA - ESTUARIES UNDER PRESSURE"

International Conference from 14th to 17th  September,1994  at
the  Zoological  Institute and Zoological Museum University of
Hamburg
organized by:
*WWF-Germany, Coastal & Marine Unit
*Norddeutsche Naturschutzakademie
*Verein Jordsand zum Schutze der Seevoegel und der Natur  e.V.
BACKGROUND

The North and Baltic Sea Coasts often stand in the front  line
of attack - from nature and economics. In our river estuaries,
the conflicts between economics and  nature  conservation  are
clearly illustrated.

As many  large  harbours  are  situated  there,  estuaries are
directly influenced by the  effects  of  all  developments  in
maritime  operation  and  harbours.  Extended deepening of the
river-bed will be continued in the rivers Elbe, Weser and Ems,
the same fate may await the Odra. Efforts costing millions are
employed to channel the  lower  reaches  of  rivers  and  huge
amounts  of  sediments  - sometimes heavily contaminated - are
moved around every year in  order  to  make  the  river-mouths
"suitable"  for  shipping companies.  Some rivers have to cope
with enormous contaminant loadings.  Dykes and  dams  uncouple
estuaries from the ecologically-important influence of the sea
and have also contributed to the drastic change  in  the  once
vital river landscape. Just a few examples of the diverse uses
which are required of river-mouths.  Until now, however, their
ecological  value  has  been  either  underestimated or hardly
considered. This will also be one of the themes of the Coastal
Day.

To develop estuaries in an environmentally sensitive manner is
a complex process and requires a  fine-tuned  approach  rather
than  forcing  it  into  stone  and  steel  corsets.  How  can
estuaries  be  integrated  into  conservation   concepts   for
protection  of the Wadden Sea?  What new schemes are necessary
for coastal protection  and  agriculture?  Is  there  still  a
chance  for  ecologically-oriented  planning  in  the  coastal
region? What possibilities are there to achieve a reduction in
shipping  activities and contaminant loads in rivers?  Are not
the shipping and harbour industry undermining their own  basis
if  they  continue  to set their sights on river deepening and
unrestrained competition?  What  management  plans  should  be
adopted  for estuarine development in the future?  In order to
answer  these  questions  accurately   and   com-prehensively,
national  and international experience must be drawn together:
from organisations, management, science, politics, from theory
and  practice.  You  are  warmly  invited  to  share  in  this
discussion,  to gather information and to take part in further
steps towards possible solutions.
