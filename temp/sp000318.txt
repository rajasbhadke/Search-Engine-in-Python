I am proposing the start of a new internet mailing list, called
Digital Anarchy. Briefly, the philosophy of digital anarchy is
that the beauty of the internet, usenet, and other forms of mass
telecommunications is total freedom and lawlessness that exists.
In fact, the internet is the only place in the U.S. where such a lack
of government intervention and censorship exits. 

But how long will our freedom last? How long will it be until
the government decides to show its ugly head in cyberspace?
This mailing list will open to the discussion of the following
issues, and all related issues:
1) Usenet censorship (e.g. alt.sex.*)
2) monitoring of the Usenet by the government
3) monitoring of private e-mail by the police for suspicious or
illegal activity.
4) Should minors be allowed internet access?
5) What are the responsibilities involved in participating in the
usenet/internet culture?

The discussion is open to all; i.e. whether you are for or against
any of those five issues, or anything related, then your views
are more than welcome.

Also, I would like to post in the mailing list any news (current 
events) from T.V., newspapers, or magazines related to this topic
that catches the eye of anyone who subscribes to this list.
This group will be unmoderated and uncensored. Members of the
government and police are also welcome to participate.

Please send all subscription requests to either 
simitzis@ele.uri.edu
or
digianarch@aol.com

Thank you.
