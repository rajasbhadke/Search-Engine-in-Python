Evil Sergeant Garcia has kidnapped a beautiful senorita and imprisoned her
in his Fort.  As the masked crusader, Zorro, your mission is to find the girl
and rescue her from his clutches.  Garcia's guards will do everything they can to
slow you down.  Be prepared to do battle!  You'll climb ladders, explore dark
passages, leap from rooftop to rooftop, bounce on improbable trampolines.
 
In every screen there are puzzles and perils.  Mapping is advisable, since you travel
through many screens more than once.  Work back and forth, from screen to screen,
finding crucial objects and clues.  And don't be surprised if some objects you find
seem to have magical properties!
 
 
Game Controls and Indicators
 
Joystick Operation:
 
In a swordfight, push the joystick toward Guard to push him off the screen or a ledge.
 
To defeat a Guard, press joystick button when both swords are down (forming a V).
 
Pause game by hitting space bar. Hitting space or joystick button will resume play.
 
Pick up and drop objects by pressing joystick fire button.
 
Sound effects toggle by pressing S key.
 
Scoring:
 
Defeat Guard----------------------------------------5
Get object from Hotel Storage Room----------------200
Take Money Bag, various other things----Current Bonus
 
Bonus Points:
 
The game begins with 2,200 Bonus Points.  The longer Zorro takes to complete a task,
the lower the Bonus counter goes (it never goes below 1,000).  After the first
task, the Bonus counter resets to 9,900 for each remaining task.
 
Hints:
 
Zorro can only carry one object at a time (except the hanky, which goes into a
pocket).
 
When Zorro picks something up, his sword is put away; he doesn't drop it.
 
Check Hotel from time to time for new objects.
 
There can be as many as six different ways to leave a screen.
 
It's a good idea to make a map to help keep track of Zorro's progress.
Indicate on the map objects he's found and where he found them.       
 
Also, if you haven't seen my cheat yet, get out a sector editor and change:
 
Track $0C  Sector $6  Bytes $99,9A
                      From  $C6,BB
                      To    $EA,EA
 
This'll give you unlimited Zorros to work with!
