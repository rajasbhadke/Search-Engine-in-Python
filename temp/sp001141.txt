THE ITALIAN JOB

Florence has to be one of the most beautiful cites 
in Italy if not in the world.  Nestled in a Tuscan 
valley it lies half way between Milan and Rome.  
Thanks to the hospitality of some friends in the 
Anarchist Movement of Florence (MAF) three members 
of the Workers Solidarity Movement were recently 
able to visit this city.  During the week we spent 
there we were able to be tourists by day and meet 
with anarchists by night.

On the Friday night that we were arrived in Florence 
the MAF organised a meal and an informal question 
and answer session in their headquarters.  Apres the 
beautiful food and some glasses of wine we learnt 
more about each others' activities and current 
situations.  The questions we were asked ranged from 
the Irish government's current relationship with 
Sinn FŽin to the possibilities for increased class 
struggle with the cease-fire?  We were also asked 
for our views on the Internet and the attempts by 
the US government to have some control over it.

COBAS

We found out about the Cobas, which is a loose 
umbrella group of unofficial trade unions.  They 
grew from broad disaffection with the official trade 
unions in 1987-88, initially in the railway, 
education and health sectors.  In 1991 they went on 
to organise what by now has become a famous one day 
general strike against the Gulf War.  It was 
fascinating to talk to someone who was involved in 
this movement.  The talks went on until the early 
hours.  A great deal of thanks must go to our tired 
translators on that night.

The Social Centres

On Saturday night we were taken on a whirlwind tour 
of the various social centres which exist in 
Florence.  These Centres are all in occupied 
buildings and operated by various groups with 
different political agendas.  The local councils 
have kicked out people from these squats but they do 
not seem to do it with any great persistence.  

The first Social Centre I visited was the 
'Autonomist', centre which had a famous rock group 
playing.  The gig itself was free although you were 
asked to contribute some small amount of money at 
the door.  Outside it looked like a deserted factory 
with some great graffiti on the walls.   Inside you 
had a bar serving draught beer, a great sound 
system, a separate area for art, design and street 
theatre props.  The place was alive with about 300 
young people, loud music and about 12 dogs!  

Next up we went to a house/villa on the edge of the 
public park which was used by the Greens, 
anarchists, and people who campaign for the rights 
of American Indians (as some Italian company is 
trying to build an observatory over their lands).  
There weren't as many people here but there was 
still a live rap band, a gallery displaying some 
interesting art and a lot of young people simply 
drinking and inhaling.  There were some political 
books and pamphlets on display along with bootleg 
tapes of concerts.

The Blues Brothers, Che and me

Finally, we went to a Leninist Social Centre in the 
south of the city.  Here a concert had just finished 
and hugely loud rock music was being played by a 
very lively DJ.  There was a bar and, as in all the 
Centres, the drink was cheap.  Young people sat 
around and shouted at each other to be heard while 
one amorous couple got to know each other better.  
On the walls there was the flag of Cuba, the hammer 
and sickle (naturally) and posters for every anti-
imperialist struggle from Palestine to Guatemala.  
Upon this scene of late night/early morning revelry 
the handsome features of the Che Guevara, coupled 
with the Blues Brothers looked down from the walls.  
I wondered what Che would  make of it all ?

The Social Centres were a great experience to see in 
operation.  Coming from a country that brings the 
law down on your head with furious vengeance should 
you dare think of occupying unused buildings, I was 
impressed at the new breath of life these places 
had.  I can think of many buildings in Dublin that 
could be used in this way.  The Centres provides a 
place where young people can go and not be told how 
to dress or be charged exorbitant money for drink.  
Politics don't seem to get debated on Saturday 
nights (if it gets debated at all, I cannot say).  
Importantly, the Centres provide a place where you 
know there exists a culture which is at least anti-
authoritarian.

Anarchists in the unions

On Sunday we met with anarchists active in the CGIL 
(a major union federation) who are in official trade 
union in Education.  They see getting anarchists 
elected as shop stewards as important in an attempt 
to deal with the heavy bureaucracy which exists 
within the official trade unions.  They too are 
faced with big unions who have a leadership 
completely divorced from the issues affecting the 
ordinary member.  Their aim is to build a rank and 
file movement .

Gratzi,  heres to the future 

So after a week of sunshine, art , culture and 
politics we returned to Ireland.  We were treated 
with great hospitality and shown warm friendship, 
especially by the comrades of the MAF.  I returned 
hopeful, knowing that the passion for true freedom 
and anarchy burns not only in some Irish hearts but 
also in the hearts of friends in Florence.

         CGT Doubles vote in Union Elections

THE ANARCHO-syndicalist union in Spain, 
(Confederacion General de Trabajadores (CGT)
 has doubled its vote in the 
latest elections for union representatives to RENFE, 
the State rail company.

The way representatives are elected in Spain is to 
allow the workers to vote for which union they would 
like to support them, and the union then gets that 
proportion of representatives.

CGT is now the second largest union with 31% of the 
vote, after CCOO (Comissiones Obreres), the 
communist-dominated union. The rise of the anarchist 
vote is due to its more militant stand compared to 
other unions, in its fight to stop the privatisation 
of RENFE and its demand to keep it as a single 
company.

The CGT has also increased its vote recently in the 
SEAT factory in Martorell, Spain, from 7 to 12 
delegates, due to its superior strike support work.

          Australian Anarchism

ABOUT 350 people turned up for the 'Visions of 
Freedom' anarchist conference in Sydney, Australia, 
last January.  Workshops dealt with anarchist media, 
workplace organising, womens struggles, 
privatisation, and more.  During the conference a 
small computer centre connected to the Internet was 
set up.  The entire Spunk Press archive (which 
includes articles, pamphlets and policy statements 
from the WSM) was available to participants on 
either computer disk or on paper.

           **  Anarchism in France  **

The following piece is taken from a report sent by an 
American member of the Industrial Workers of the World 
(IWW) to their public mailing list on the internet 
recently (IWW-NEWS@org.com).  It provides a personal 
snapshot of part of the French anarchist movement.

The main 2 groups I encountered were the Federation 
Anarchist Francaise (FAF) which is the oldest and 
largest French  anarchist group, and operates a 
beautiful bookstore in the Bastille district, as well as 
a real FM radio station (Radio Libertaire, 89.4 fm),  
and a popular newspaper (Le Monde Libertaire); and I 
also spent a lot of  time with the French CNT*, which is 
the second largest French anarchist group (even though 
it's only really been around for about 5 years) .

CNT has it's offices in a beautiful black and red 
building on rue de Vignolles.  It's opening new sections 
in France almost every week,  currently has about 500 
members in Paris, and about another 1000 across  France, 
though membership is growing rapidly. "

  ** The Spanish CNT and the struggle in Puerto Real  **

(£1.50 inc. p+p from the Solidarity Federation, PO Box 
73, Norwich, NR3 1QD, England.) 

FOR ABOUT TWO years from July 1936 huge parts of 
republican Spain were anarchist dominated.  Millions 
were involved in collectives in cities like Madrid and 
Barcelona, on the land and in anarchist militias 
fighting Franco at the front.  Factories, bus companies, 
hospitals, gas works and much more were taken over and 
run by the workers.  In 1939 the republic fell and the 
movement was smashed.  Anarchism, though a nice idea now 
remains little more then a historical curiosity- 
right??? Wrong!!!!

Puerto Real

In Spain there are two large syndicalist unions in 
operation today, the CNT and the CGT.  Between them they 
organise tens of thousands of workers.  Both unions have 
organised highly successful strikes and demonstrations.  
This pamphlet is based on a talk by Pepe Gomez of the 
CNT's Puerto Real/Cadiz section given in London in 
October 1993.  It is based on the long running battle 
between the CNT and the shipyard bosses.  This struggle 
has continued since 1978.

Gomez places great emphasis on the way the struggle 
has been broadened beyond just the shipyard workers.  
Activities have been directed throughout by village 
assemblies.  These involved shipyard workers and workers 
from a wide range of other industries, in fact most of 
the local community; employed and unemployed, men, women 
and children.  

This meant that the fight went beyond the shipyard 
gates.  Other issues around education, health services, 
the campaign against a new golf course, against 
privatisation of a local cemetery and local taxes.  The 
emphasis was on direct democracy and direct action.  The 
basic tenets of anarchism were used and to good effect.

Juan Carlos not welcome here 

In 1987 a visit by the Spanish monarch became a major 
focus for action.  This involved occupations,  sealing 
off parts of the shipyards and barricading roads.  The 
state responded by drafting in police reinforcements.  
The union and the community organised their own defence 
with slings, stones and any handy missiles.  Other 
sections of this pamphlet deal with women's organisation 
during the strike and relations with other unions, whose 
members consistently supported the CNT in the 
assemblies.

Anarchism delivers

This pamphlet is only a few pages long but a great 
read.  It provides proof positive that anarchism can 
still be a powerful force and presents strategies that 
can deliver the goods.  For example, after the 1987 
flare-up the workers gained major concessions.  Eight 
new ships were brought in to be refitted, and an early 
retirement scheme with a pension linked to salary 
increases was conceded by the shipyard bosses.

The other major point is to show the importance of 
linking limited disputes with wider issues and involving 
the whole community.

          **  The Spanish anarchist unions  **

After Franco died in 1975 the National Confederation of 
Workers (CNT) began to blossom once more.  Within a 
matter of months its membership had increased from a few 
hundred activists to 150,000.  Unfortunately the union 
split when a dispute arose over whether to sit on the 
state regulated workplace committees which negotiate 
with the bosses.  

Those who stood for election to the committees 
formed the General Confederation of Workers (CGT).  The 
CNT refused to participate and remained affiliated to 
the International Workers' Association (the anarcho-
syndicalist international). 

There are also unions which do not declare 
themselves anarchist but whose policies and structures 
show a major libertarian socialist influence.  These 
include the unions of the dockers (Co-ordinadora) and 
the rural workers (SOC).

 It is important to note that in Spain many workers are 
not union members.  However almost all workers vote to 
elect representatives onto workplace committees.  
Anarchists form a majority on the committees in some 
major workplaces, and a sizable minority in many more.
