The printouts are from a collection dating from 1983-1985, and were

IBM PC-XT. The Bulletin Board Systems and other services were located
throughout the United States, and captured by Jason Scott, who can
attest to their authenticity.

 First off to the message posted a while back about conferencing and talking to 
 which ever people on the line you want: When on a conference if you say 
 something to one person everyone hears unless you have control and you call
  a person and you aren't in conference mode yet.It has nothing to do with the 
 type of computer you have.Conferencing has nothing to do with computers that 
 you own,unless you have a blue-box on disk. Secondly,to the message referring 
 to a platinum or gold box,I,personally have never heard of either.I'm not
 going to doubt you ,YET,but please tell us all exactly what this type of box 
 does.Get a little more technical...

 Ok...To the Line Breaker, or whatever his name is, you are not the sysop of 
 the Safehouse, as anyobdy with a shred of intelligence know that the much
 revered Apple Bandit runs the board, By the way, if you;re having trouble
 getting on, it;s because Bandit is putting ProDos on the board, and it should
 be back up early next week.

 Gold boxes: Well, my trusty H.A.C.K. thingy by the all - knowing Grey Wolf 
 lists the Gold Box here...He also gives the numbers for detecting traces... 
 We all know how much Grey Wolf knows, eh?

 Those numbers said to detect traces don;t do that, they supposedly detect
 if there is a bug on the line. You cannot detect a trace, because they don;t 
 really put anything detectable on the line.

 Call Revelstone, (612) 831-1492 and tell them Doc Discord sent you, and you;ll

 TRUE I HATRE ALL THESE NEW FUCKIN BOXES AND I WISH SOMEONE COULD MAKE ANOTHER

 ANOTHER CONTROLL AND THEN WE HOOK ANOTHER ONE UP AND CONNECT THEM BY LOOPS ITS 
 PRETTY HARD TO DENY THAT THE MASTER DOES HAVE SOMETHING WHICH HE CAN START 
 CONFERENCES.HE SAYS ITS HIS PHONE.(HOW ABOUT A PLATINUM PHONE?) HE CLAIMS HE 
 CAN CALL THE CONFERENCE LINE DIRECT AND START ONE ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR 
 A BLUE BOX.I DONT KNOW HOW HIS PHONE AAAT AND HE DOESNT REALLY KNOW EITHER BUT 
 ALL I CAR ABOUT IS THAT HE CAN START AS MANY CONFERENCES AS HE WANTS WHENEVER 
 HE WANTS WITHIN ABOT 30 SECS PER CONFERENCE. I HAVE PERSONNALY HAVE BEEN ON ONE 
 WHEN WE STARTED TWP CONF AND WE CONNECTED THEM BY LOOPS.THE CONNECTION WAS VERY 
 GOOD AND YOU COULDNT TELL WHICH CONFERENCE SOMEONE WAS ON.THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS 
 THAT A FRIEND NAMED LON COULDNT GET THIS FUCKIN TONE OFF SO WE HAD TO DROP THAT 
 CONFERENECE.WE USED THE OTHER ONE FOR ABOUT 9 HRS IN WHICH IT TRADED MANY HANDS:

 I would really love to see those platinum box plans...You made my day with that

 speed dialing, and quick fingers...Hell, I have started them in 30 seconds 
 myself...To Keymaster:     No offense, but since "hack-Man" was so kind enough 
 to inform all of the users on COSMOS that he was there, the number was 
 changed. I would NOT consider him very reliable. Also, ther is no such thing as

  Well, it seems that I haven't been `round here a while (haven't had much
  to say) well now I do. It seems that The Franklin Scientific Institute has sent 
  me a catalog with many various kits on all subjects (chem,bio,elecetc) and one 
  of these kits brought some interest to me....It is a starter kit desighned to 
  produce bird noises,buzzes and all sorts of SOUNDS. It uses a chip (I believe 
  the one used in a old TAP b.b schematic) To produce the sounds and seems very

 So until then, just stop arguing. Also, I called Master and he says he Cannot 
 reach inwards with it, it doesn not produce 2600Hz, he cannot reach 
 rate+routes,etc. all he can dial with it is the conference #'s. he says 
 he has modified his phone. I WILL NOT COMMENT AT THIS TIME.

 % in to joining the board. Also       %
 % The Safe House is a very LOW        %
 % KEYED board. No one has every       %
 % been busted. The information        %
 % on this S.H. would blow your        % 
 % mind. I know about the other        %
 % S.H. I've even tried to talk        %
 % to the Sysop but I have not         %
 % been able to reach him. One         %
 % of us has to change our name.       %
 % Because a lot of my new members     %
 % think that's my board. and they     %
 % sign on to be disapointed. The      %
 % Safe House that your friend runs    %
 % is very small compared to ours.     %
 % we cover all of the underground     %
 % subject. Everything from phone      %
 % company procudures to credit card   %
 % buying. you name it and we can      %
 % tell you about it.  I'm sorry       %
 % about the confusion. Maybe this     %
 % will clear it up. If you want       %
 % more information on joining the     %
 % S.H. in NY leave me E-mail. I will  % 
 % tell you how to join. My S.H. is    % 
 % going off line for about a week     %
 % we are changing the system over to  % 
 % a 45 meg system with a complete     %
 % libarbry of system files. (about 1  % 
 % meg alone.) I'm looking for a new   %
 % board also something like the one   % 
 % we are on now. But it will carry    % 
 % about 100 sub-boards. Well it's     %

 This is to all who want to join the New York based Safe House. We are looking 
 for a few good people. To be exacted '10'. To join you must have some kind of 
 phreaking or carding history. Also you must have atleast 5 good refences 
 from others on the board. If you have been busted before by the phone feds 
 forget it. Also all information will be checked out within 5 hours. For more 
 information leave your real first name and a voice number to be reached at. I 
 will be back on this board by 10/4/84.

Blue Beard:
           The CN/A for 813 on my list is: 813-228-7871. I don't know if it 
works,but give it a try...Also, explain how a phone can be modified to produce
mf's? I'd be really interested in finding out how...You can't just install MF 
chips, because that required totally different schematics & a different key 
pad. Please explain how you did this.

     I AGREE...I THINK THIS DEBATE SHOULD BE ENDED NOW, BUT... 
     IS THIS 'BOX' PLATINUM OR PLATILUM?

     ALSO, WHY DIDN'T THE MASTER HIMSELF POST THIS INFO INSTEAD OF USING A 
 MEDIATOR OF SORTS?

     OF COURSE, HE COULD BE ON SOME ANCIENT SXS AND BE ABLE TO DIAL CONFERENCE
 NOS. DIRECTLY OR HE MAY HAVE FOUND A 'NORMAL' CONFERENCE NO. THAT CAN BE 
 DIRECTLY DIALED.

     WHO KNOWS? HOPEFULLY SHARP WILL SOON.
