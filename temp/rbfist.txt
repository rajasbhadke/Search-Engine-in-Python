My mistake?  In what, voicing my opinion when it was asked for in one of Dead
Meat's messages.  Stated something like: ....What do you guys think, post a
message about this...  It was to everyone.  First you feel it's wrong for
Dead Meat to voice his opinion, then you now feel it was wrong for me to
voice mine when it was asked for specificly about anything on this topic?
Still you just said something like "I guess it was alright for you (speaking
to Dead Meat) to voice his opinion".  So it still sounds like your not really
completely sure it's alright to voice one's own opinion if your a nobody like
me?  (taken from your message that said something pretty clear like "I really
don't care what the bulk of you have to think")  So not only do you half?
approve of anyone voicing their own opinion in the U.S.A. (especially the
ones that don't have some sort of status in the world?), but you won't even
care what they have to say.

My message was a type of physicological evaluation of your other messages,
Dead Meat just said post your opinion of the topic being discussed, which
amoung other things was if you where imature or any of the other things you
guys where talking about.  I'll give an explanation for my post.  #1: hot
head by blowing up at something that didn't look like you should of blown up
at (because it wasn't even directed at you specifically, Dead Meat said it
was to all), and the temper you seem to have comming from your messages.
(which I was right about?  You just said you have cooled down or something?
So you must of been mad for a couple of days?)  #2: imature the way you used
phrases to call the guy names.  Some of them were pretty funny, but childish
to me.  #3:  The ego you seem to have by thinking of yourself like you have
control of every single connection.  (taken from your message that said
something to the effect of ...I'll cut off your connections..., like that was
going to make him shut up instantly.  And the ego added on by being a sysop
that i've seen a number of sysops have to much ego about themselves just
because they are a sysop (not speaking about the sysop of this board).  If
someone asks for an opinion from anyone on the board, i'll give mine.
Everyone else is invited for theirs, and some posted just like I did, just
not speaking about exactly the same thing. This is the U.S.A., so I feel free
to voice my opinion, why should I be inhibited?  I'm usually at school and
don't have the time to call boards, but it's the holiday now until the 18th.

MM

ps. and you go and ask me for my voice # in email to yell it out over the
phone or what??  That will solve it?

I'd like to see who would of won the first two bets.  This is great soap opra
entertainment!  I'll take the money if Dead Meat doesn't want it. haha.  Did
he win or loose the first two bets he took on?  I'd suspect he won by the
message you just left?  You aren't going to answer his questions that he
answered? Pretty unfair if you ask me!  (Ok, so nobody asked me this time,
but you keep putting my name into your messages, you can expect some sort of
a reply about it.)  Like Dead Meat said, this is a free country isn't it?

But I asked for anyones opinion of the subject because other users can see it
from a different light, so they can see different things, and speed along the
discussion.

You told me you where 8 years old when you first used an Apple ][, but didn't
buy one until later, so where did you use one in second grade?  Back then the
first Apple ][ computers where only in H.S.'s.??

Did you play the star trek game on a Disk II drive or from cassette?

The Martyr only said the message I posted on the modem board and then soon
deleted after agreeing with him was in bad reference, but the one uploaded to
the board he though higher of and never said it was wrong to upload.  Just
the other one which is gone, so not many users saw it.  The HST Rom bug was
going around faster than you think I believe, and if I had not said something
about it two weeks later someone else would of typed up a text file about it.
Mine was in a professional attitude and first line says mainly for sysops or
close, since I don't phreak anymore, I am not on tons of IIe 9600 or IIGS
9600 boards to leave this to the sysops.  Then only a select few of the
sysops would know about it.  If you want to discuss this, please read the
previous messages completely, they will futher answer why it was left...

Well boys and girls, as you can see Dead Meat doesn't want to end it.  He
would like to keep you all entertained.  He has become the show off of the
board. Well good for him.. I simply asked if we could stop this.  He found
and posted some very lame reasons why we should not end it.  I even asked him
E-Mail if it could be ended, I GUESS NOT!

Can you belive this guy?  He just can't stop calling people names can he?  He
sounds very imature.  I'd be glad to discuss this out here for all users to
give comments on both sides, but he sounds like he knows he's wrong and
doesn't want anyone to know it?

   Well some people have very little control of themselves, and have a lot of
growing up to do.  Just let him ammuse himself by spewing forth a torent of
lame insults.

ps.  What's the deal with The Dee Jay and the martyr?  Did they get into a

I see.. let me calculate this.. Mobius/Dave doesn't like me, obviously.  See
the thing about Dave, Macro Mike, is he is real easy for me to reach and talk
to.  (not to swear at)  As you seem to be wrapped up in.  All of you are
being very one tracked and mindless.  Listen to what you people are saying,
though..**ANYONE** that swears is immature?  Well, thats obviously not true.
Its to respond to people making fun of/insulting me.  If you were on the
street and said that "I was immature", I might tell you to "Fuck Off" and so
would many, many others on this board.

Get your mind off that.

Macro Mike is wrong --> I can prove it.  He HAD HAD to involve himself in the
fight by replying to Dead Meats question:  He was the first to spew off the
insults toward me.  Before that it was between Dead Meat and I.  He involved
himself, and I felt it was needed for a defense.

Secondly, "but it sounds like he know he is wrong but doesn't want anyone to
know it."  Thats an OUT AND OUT LIE..  I posted a long time ago admitting I
was wrong to DEAD MEAT, not to Macro Mike.  MM started with me.


** Go back, I am sure most of you haven't read this.  Then you set up your
next line of defense with NO facts.. 

Now Mobius, Dead Meat and MM are playing the immaturity game.  They will not
let it go.

"I didn't say one swear"

Just let it slide...

He said "lame reasons?"  I was just asking if he really started when he was 8
years old.  I wasn't trying to continue the discussion except to find out who
won the first two bets (not that I want his money) but he wouldn't say.  Like
he said, he asked me to end it, so I have agreed with him to end it because
he asked nicely and i'm a nice guy, so consider it ended.  (But I must say I
wasn't trying to entertain anyone besides getting to the truth for my own
reasons.)  Have a good one everybody!

Yeah, a little name calling battle I would say.  Dave gave Sorceror's
Apprentice and Necroprancer his pass on Brave New World, and they got in and
fucked around with his user list..And Dave let out some personal info on
Mike.. And now Dave AND the Martyr are both leaving the modem world...Fuck

I don't think Dave/DJ did.  I still think he shouldn't have talked bad about
me, but we were both a little wrong in this case.

Anyway, its all over.  I have Ray delete my account and make it Billy
Pilgrim's, so I don't care any more.

BNW is now private. If you want to get on it, leave e-mail to Billy (the new
sysop), the number is private also.. so it is invite ONLY now.

[No Ralph, it has nothing to do with SA/Dave.  I'm dropping out like I said.]

I'm beginning to think less and less of this guy.  Here are a few quotes he
left me from the email I just got.  He said:

"coward
coward
coward
coward

.. I cannot say it any more.  Or it would fill all 80megs."

And you want to know why?  Because he asked me for my voice phone number over
a week ago and he is mad I won't give it to him.  Anyone can get his voice
phone # by running a CNA on his board's #, or asking any sysop that doesn't
like him. Sure he offered his voice phone # to me, but he knows i'm a little
to old to be pranking him.  I left him a detailed explanation with a few
reasons why I didn't want to give him my phone #, and he took that as being a
coward?  I'll stand up for myself guy and say I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE MY
PHONE NUMBER.  It's that simple.  With your past posting telling all about
the rag files you have made, there is no way I would trust you with my
parents private unlisted phone #.  I wouldn't fully trust anyone LD if I
didn't know them, and we don't know each other, so you can forget my phone
number. I backed up everything I said with an explanation a few messages ago
in both email and on this public board, and your responce was "Fuck off".  I
think you should think about what I said because others are agreeing with me
privately and publicly as you can see.  It has nothing to do with disliking
you, it's just a conclusion that people can draw from your messages.
Wouldn't you say someone that couldn't control what they said and call other
people names time and time again is a little imature?  I would, and so would
most of the other users who you don't know.  Dead Meat agreed with me when I
posted a response, he asked everyone to post a response.  In your email you
also said "try not to respond to this, you pussy."  Sounds imature to me...
Since you seem to be hard to deal with in private email without having to
call people names, I will leave all my replys in public...  How about if we
post a voting topic on this and see what the other users say about it since
it will be anonymous?  I'd be glad to sit here on the public board and
discuss it with you...

        I have been around a long time,  in the past 4-5 years of modemming i
have seen rise and fall of many groups/networks/people.  It mostly stands
from people dropping out,  the main reason..  "The modem world does not wish
to 'grow-up'"    I myself am currently semi-retired from Apple/Modem/Pirate
world.
 I am venturing on into a more sophisticated world (the macintosh).  Seeing
most of those who have macintosh's are usually 18 and over they are much more
mature than the averages person in the Apple II modemworld (where the average
age seems to be about 15).   Maybe i would have stayed with Apple II,  maybe
it will grow up some day.  But for now,  the war's rage on,  the rags still
continue,  and the assholes still are around.    Take notice people,  why
bother with the rags and wars?  Why not just write some great software,
pirates some cool wares, and be happy and helpful,  instead of being
tight-asses?     In other words,  work harder and maybe you will grow up. 
Just as a note,  for those of you 15 and under, "What would your mommy say?"

***** RAG FILE: Brian Fist *****

 Ok DewDz and DewDettes,

 here's the scoop on your's and mine, favorite (K)rackist,
Brian Fist:

  Yesterday just before i called, i was sitting on the
couch watching the okra, cough cough, opra show, and i hear
"Ring Ring Ring" and thought "HiP" one of my idols, Heh, at
any rate, i stumble to my feet and low and behold it's our
favorite m0e dum princess 'Pirette', and the reason for
paging me, "BRIAN FIST IS A ASSHOLE!@#", i thought to
myself, "SHIT, i've known that for 2 years", so enter chat
mode, and it's a extremly hip feeling let me tell you, and
karen sez, "Pick up the fone!", so i went voice, and she
tells me that BF is bagging on me, ok what else is new, i
guess when someone's culturally disadvantaged like himself,
they have to bag on someone, and usually someone of a
higher intellilect. So i say ok, i better call MAD and
check dis out, and sure enought i see things like "Nibble
counts are shit" and ralph has to call people to help him
crack wares. Well this was nothing new, and after i posted
my sentiments at the time i hung up and was talking to
pirette, and decided to call BF, and here's the highlights:


 Discman : "Is dennis there?"
 Dennis  : "This is he"
 Necro   : "my name's Discman and i got your number from
            hansel and he said you could help me crack a
            ware?"
 Dennis  : "Whats the program?"

 Discman : "Ummm...Let me look" (Thinking of a ware??)
           "Thunder chopper!"
 Dennis  : "Well, thats from actionsoft, a subsiderary of
            Sublogic, and they use there own disk format,
            it's not 18 sectors and it's not 16 sectors,
            the only way is if i had a bit copy or the
            original"
 Discman : "Ahhh, there's no way huh? well what programs
            have you cracked?"

 Dennis  : "Legacy of the Ancients, Beyond pinball. And now
            im working on a 18 sector to 16 sector to 18
            sector converter."

 Discman : "I also got this other one, it's called Earl
            Weaver's baseball from electronic arts?"

 Dennis  : "Can you copy it?, if you can and it boots, your
            all done, and it's ready to go."
 Discman : "Let me try, what can i use locksmiths?"
 Dennis  : "Ya, fastcopy"
 Discman : "It got a error on track 6?"
 Dennis  : "How bad?"
 Discman : "the full track@!"
 Dennis  : "Ok, get out a nibble editor, like copy II+ and
            we'll see if there's any data on there."
 Discman : "Ok, im there, and it sez D5 AA 96, ect."
 Dennis  : "Do you see a D5 AA AB?"
 Discman : "I see a D5 AA AD?"
 Dennis  : "Ok, what about after that?"
 Discman : "it's all E4's"
 Dennis  : "ok, there's data there, do you have Advanced
            demuffin?"  
BF's Mom : " Get off that Damn phone!
 Discman :  "Ya, whats that do?"
 Dennis  : "It's cracks disks."
 Discman : "Oh, ok, i've got it up, written by the stack,
            he must be GREAT!"
 Dennis  : "Ok, enter monitor, now type B925:18 60 <CR>,
            B942:18 60 <CR>, and ^Y return"
 Discman : "Ok"
 Dennis  : "Now make it start at track 6, sector 0, and
            stop at track 6, sector F."
 Discman : "Ok, now copy disk?"
 Dennis  :  "YA."
 Discman : "Ok, it copyed it"
 Dennis  : "Ok, try and boot it."
 Discman : "Ok. the ea title screen came up and it
            rebooted?"
 BF's Mom: "Get off the phone!"
 Dennis  : "Mom, i'll be off in a minute, i kracking, Sorry
           about that, Do you know how to find nibble
           counts?"
 Discman : "No"
 Dennis  : "Shit, can you call me back in 10 minutes?"
 Discman : "Why?"
 Dennis  : "Cuz i gotta call my friend."
 Discman : "Who??"
 Dennis  : "The b0x."
 Discman : "Is he good?"
 Dennis  : "Ya, he write's wares, and i don't know anything
            about EA nibble counts."
 Discman : "What wares is he writing"
 Dennis  : "California games IIgs."
 Discman : "Oh, well, don't they have cracks for EA wares
            in hardcore computist?"
 Dennis  : "Ya, but EA's are all different"
 Discman : "Well i got a bunch of files on how to crack
            EA's?"
 Dennis  : "What ones?"
 Discman : "Arcticfox, Marble Madness..Ect."
 Dennis  : "Well look at those and see if there the same."
 Discman : "Ok, this one works!"
 Dennis  : "Ok, well it's done, do you know how to make a
            page?"
 Discman : "No, do you think you could?"
 Dennis  : "Ya, I guess i could, Hansel and i will
            distribute it around for ya if yu want?"
 Discman : "Ok. do you know how to put pages on?"
 Dennis  : "Intercept."
 Discman : "Whats intercept?"
 Dennis  : "it put's title pages on."
 Discman : "Oh ok, well i'll give you a call in a little
            while,ok?
 Dennis  : "Ok, bye."



    Well there you have it, our her0 caught in a unknowing
trap, "NIBBLE COUNTS ARE SHIT", well dennis, how come you
had to call the b0x to find out about one? Explain that?
"I KRACKED LEGACY OF THE ANCIENTS", but dennis, i thought
you only converted it, i'll send you my converter to if
you'd like to see it, but the thing i enjoyed the most was
listening to his mom in the background saying to get off
the phone, that had to have been the most hilarous part of
it, and thru all this pirette was on my 3 way, and i was
waiting for her to start laughing, fortunately she didn't
otherwise BF might have gotten wise, oh well.

 Dennis did you make that page? Ya probally, you are so
fucking lame,  you contradicted everything you bragged
about your self, what a sad case you are son, well i case
were one in the same, when you come up against something
you can't do, which is a majority of the time you call the
b0x, what a dewd you are.  YOUR LAME D00D!
