An example of anarchosyndicalist organisation:

'At a conference of local unions in Barcelona, the leadership sought and
obtained the support of the unions to continue to collaborate with the
government of Catalonia after the May Days.  However, the unions refused 
to withhold financial support for the Libertarian Youth, who opposed the
policy of collaboration vigorously in their publications.  And the unions
also refused to call upon the transit workers not to distribute these
opposition publications in the public transit system, or the milk drivers
to stop distributing the Libertarian Youth papers together with the daily
milk.

And then I saw a Libertarian Youth conference which was prepared to vote
almost unanimously to condemn without debate the policy of government
collaboration.  However, the chairman insisted that supporters of
collaboration be given a chance to speak and be heard.  I saw six young 
men go to the platform and argue earnestly and eloquently for their
viewpoint.  There were no interruptions, no booing.  The vote remained
almost unanimous in favour of opposing collaboration.'
