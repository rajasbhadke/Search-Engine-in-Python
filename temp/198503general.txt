 Well, yours truly, Simo Jester of the Elk River DECA took first place 
statewide in Restaurant Marketing and Management, Master Employee level at the 
State DECA finals. This means that I get to compete in nationals in May down 
in sunny San Francisco! Getting the award rounded off three days of fun and 
competition. There were a couple of dances (44th Street played at one of 
them), preliminary awards sessions (I took a first and second place spot in two
events here), partys (toga in 1430), etc... The final awards ceremony was held 
at the Carleton Celebrity room last (tuesday) night. Some of the speakers 
included Carl Pohlad, owner of the twins, and several other people. Winning 
the first place trophy in my event was great... it gave me a chance to hug all 
the good looking girls in Elk River DECA, for one thing... Well, enough 
bragging (well, actually more than enough)... I had a great time, and heartily 
recommend DECA to all people... Simon Jester

  2) How bad are the legal risks involved? Do the cops hide in the bushes and 
wait, or is law enforcement infrequent?
  3) Is there a lot of driving involved? (I don't want to run down the family

fun began when we were talking to Broadway Hacker at FM 103 NY radio) and we 
got a sweet 15 second broadcast. Was fun...really fun. We were screaming 
control and all this stuff...what a blast. Then an operator just like the one 
on Midnight Star's album (real southern accent - TSPS operator) came on...and I
suddenly was "Mr. Jones" and all this.. she was really not sure whether it 
was legit or not... eventually the controller got seperated because he got 
interrupted by some hotshot Supervisor. So much for that call. Just one of 
many exploits. Anyone know of other services offering conference capabilites? 
Unfortunately, Canada is no longer safe (as of January, 27th or so ESS VII )...

  In response to the earlier message about your "boyfriend" and whether or not 
you should do it together. I think it would be better for both of you to wait 
until you can think rationally before you decide to take the leap... Remember, 
there is only one first time, and if you waste it on someone who you don't 
really love, it will wreck it for later on in life. And since you are only a 
Sophomore, (Sophomore means "smart-fool"), I think it would be best if you just
stayed young a little bit longer and left the serious lovemaking for married 
life later on. If your boyfriend can't handle your decision, then he must only 
be after you for what you are on the outside, when it is whats inside that 
matters the most.

  You can do what you want to do, but remember that whatever you do could come 
back to haunt you later. For example, V.D., pregnancy, etc. So it is best to 
wait until you can handle it, (marriage), and stick to getting through 
High-school. H.S.

  hasn't the mac factory been running at full speed so far? that factory is 
very fast and efficient. well if ibm dropped the jr. then apple is going to 
be doing some good business.

  why did they drop it? i thought that after they replace the bad keyboards 
that they were doing fairly well?

  Just because IBM has dropped the PC_Junior does not mean that they're out of 
the home computer race. They still have the PC,XT,AT ect... though they are 
pretty expensive i wouldn't count them out, they will also most definitly start
to manufacture a different type of computer to try to establish themselves once
more in the home computer market.

well, lator

   NO, IBM AND COMMODORE USERS/LOVERS.....   APPLE ISN'T GOING OUT OF BUSINESS...

NO, THEY AREN'T SLOWING PRODUCTION BECAUSE OF SLOW SALES....

  THEY CLOSED ALL MACINTOSH FACTORIES FOR THE BASIC REASON APPLE HAS DECIDED
GREY/BEIGH IS A DULL-DREARY COLOR AND THEY HAVE ALSO DECIDED THAT THE MACINTOSH
SHOULD BE WHITE ENOUGH TO BLIND YOU.......

  THAT'S RIGHT...LOOK FOR BIG DISCOUNTS IN THE MACINTOSH AREA>

  As Doc said, 'Down with Big Brother'? How can that be? Winston had always 
loved Big Brother.  Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.

The Quote that people have been seeing late "Down with Big Brother," has 
been put up because myself in accordance with this bbs agree that the statement
by Mr. Smith supports this bbs, MCMLXXXV - a step beyond 1984, a paradise, no
big brother. 

  Winston Smith is the lead character in the novel 1984. 

  I will put up some other quotes soon!
