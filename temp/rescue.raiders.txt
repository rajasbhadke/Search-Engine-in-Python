SOFT-DOCS FOR:  >>> RESCUE RAIDERS <<<
--------------------------------------

                Rescue Raiders is a game by Sir-Tech in which
the object is to gain control of the enemy's base. You
accomplish this by using some of your many weapons, which will
be described in full detail later on.
                In Rescue Raiders you use the joystick as well
as the keyboard.  First let's examine the joystick commands:
                The joystick directly controls the helicopter,
thus pushing up on the stick will result in the helicopter
moving up, and obviously the same with the other directions. By
depressing Button 0 your helicopter will shoot bullets, and by
depressing Button 1 you will drop one of your bombs. you depress
both of them at the same time you will release a guided
missle. When you start off you have a certain amount of bullets,
bombs, and missles for "AIR-TO-AIR" combat. You have two
sidewinder missles, ten bombs and more than enough bullets. If
at any time you run out of any of these you can replenish your
supply by returning to your own base and landing on the
platform.

          Now for the keyboard commands:
          -----------------------------

             C) Status display
            *M) Group of 5 Men (Fighters)
            *E) Group of 2 Men (Electricians)
            *T) Tank
            *D) Demolition Van
            *A) Armed Vehicles
            SB) Drop a man out of your helicopter
           ESC) Shows score and pauses game
            *H) Buy another helicopter

              (NOTE: The asterisks denote that there is a charge
for the item. See price list below.)

          Your Status:
          -----------

                Every so often you may wish to refer to your
status display.  You do this by pressing the 'C' key. At the
top of your screen will appear your status. You will first
see a row of money bags, you will see a number of large and
small bags (four small bags equals one large). As you buy
more items your money supply diminishes. After a quick pause it
will show you how many bombs how have aboard. Then it will show
you many missles you have, how many men you have aboard (if
any) and how many helicopters remaining. There is also a radar
at the top of the screen. It's basically self-explanatory, the
only thing you may want to know is that the large white squares
are helicopters.
          When you hit 'C' you will see directly below the radar
your fuel line. Check this occasionally because your fuel
diminishes quickly. Remember that if you run out of anything you
can always replenish your supply.

          Purchasing Items:
          ----------------

                To buy an item, any item, just press the letter
you wish at any time. Obviously as you buy more items you lose
more money. You should always keep track of how much money
you have.

          Description of items:
          --------------------

         -Armored Vehicles- These have one guided missle on them
and use it as soon as the enemy helicopter
comes within range. Although the missle
doesn't always hit the enemy you stand a
good chance. The problem with these is that they
can only be used once each.
         -Demolition Vans-  You need to get one of these to the
enemy's base to win.  Make sure that you have plenty of tanks
around it because they can
be destroyed by anything.
         -Electricians-     They are exactly like men, but if
you let them walk to one of your turrets, they will repair
it as long as they are not attacked while they are doing it.
         -Men-              Men are deployed in groups of five
and then can be picked up by landing near them and letting
them walk into your helicopter.  Then by hitting the space bar
while in the air you make them parachute out. (Note: You may
only carry five men at a time and when you release them some
may not open their parachute).
         -Tactical Stations-These stations lie on six different
parts of the screen.  The first three are yours and the others
are the enemy's.  These act like exterior defenses in such that
if the enemy's helicopter crashes into one of your stations it
explodes.  The same thing happens if you crash into his. To take
over a station drop off one of your men and he will enter the
station.  To simply destroy it shoot the balloon-like object a
couple of times or simply blow up the building with plenty of
bullets or bombs.
         -Tanks-            Probably the most effective item
that you have but you can only have five on the screen at once.
         -Turrets-          There are four of these on the
screen two belonging to you and the other two to him. You must
destroy these before your helicopter can get past. Tanks are the
only things that can destroy these so send them out
first.  <END>
