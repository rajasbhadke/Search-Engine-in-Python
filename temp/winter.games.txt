~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Figure Skating Tips:

 closed, the jump will be awkward. The opposite is true if you are skating BACKWARDS: trigger the jump when the skaters legs are CLOSED and the jump will be perfect. Practice makes perfect, so keep trying!

FORWARD SKATING performers can do a Double or Triple Axel Jump or turn around and begin skating backwards. Remember: be skating forwards when the timer runs out--if you're skating backwards you'll fall down!

BACKWARD SKATING athletes can do a Double or Triple Lutz Jump, a Camel or Sit Spin, or turn around and begin skating forward.

When you do SPINS, try to make six rotations. If you turn fewer than six times, your exit will be awkward, more than six turns will make you dizzy and you'll fall.

DON'T FALL DOWN!

You'll fall down if you try to move directly from a jump to a spin, a spin to a jump, a jump to another jump, or a Sit Spin to another Camel Spin. Skate backwards in between movements; skate forwards before you do an Axel Jump.

CAMEL INTO SIT AND SPIN: You can move directly from a Camel Spin to a Sit Spin - a very elegant combination worth 1.2 points!

FIGURE SKATING SCORES:

You begin with a score of 0.0 The best score is 6 points. All scores are displayed in tenths. And don't worry--your score can't go below 0.

After you successfully complete each Figure Skating movement, your score is added like this:

Movement attempts will be added to your score only if they're successfully completed.


-------------
Speed Skating
-------------

Speed Skaters can move at 30 miles per hour -- much faster than athletic track runners. In fact, Speed Skating champions are the fasted self-propelled human beings over level earth!

In Speed Skating, two racers skate side-by-side, in separate lanes, as fast as they can go!

+  You will be skating against a computer player on the top half of the screen. Your skater is on the bottom half of the screen. Press the FIRE button or SPACE BAR on the keyboard to begin the countdown.

+  When then countdown reaches "GO", begin skating by moving the joystick to the LEFT and RIGHT or pressing the keys 'J'
and 'K', to move your skater's legs. The trick is to make the skater's legs move back and forth as in real skating.

+  Continue skating by moving the joystick back and forth or pressing 'J' and 'K' in rythmic strokes to move your racer's legs. Build your natural skating rythm faster to get up to speed -- and GO FOR IT!

+  The skater with the fastest time wins the race. (duh)

+  When the race is over, press the FIRE button or SPACE BAR to begin the next event.


---------------
Hot Dog Aerials
---------------

This demonstration sport tests your guts, grace, and precision on skis. Strive for a performance of athletic artistry as you flip through the air in a dazzling series of daredevil moves.

+  Push the FIRE button or SPACE BAR to start a jump.

+  Push the joystick in one of these six directions or press the appropriate key on the keyboard to begin a movement:

--------------------------------------------------
     Daffy  U                      O  Back Scratch
              \                  /
                \              /
                  \          /
 Back Flip  J <-----  LAND  -----> K  Forward Flip
                  /          \
                /              \
              /                  \
 Mule Kick  N                      <.  Swan
--------------------------------------------------

+  To do one movement after another, move the joystick or press the appropriate key when the Hot Dog skier is in mid-air. Timing is crucial.

+  To get out of a move or begin another move push the joystick to the center (LAND) position or press the SPACE BAR.

+  Hold each movement (except the FLIPS) until you choose a different move.

+  Go into the landing position before you hit the ground, or you'll fall.

Scores:
~~~~~~~
The score is based on both style and difficulty, and is displayed after you land. The maximum is ten points.

awkward movements. Watch your landing! If you fall, you won't receive a score.

    STUNTS                           POINTS
    ---------------------------------------
    1 Stunt                            6.3
    1 Flip                             7.2
    2 Stunts (same)                    8.7
    2 Flips (same)                     9.2
    2 Stunts (different)               9.6
    1 Stunt and 1 Flip                10.0
    2 Flips (different)               10.0

    +  1.4 point penalty for each awkward movement.


--------
Ski Jump
--------

Every gust of wind chills your body as you look down from the top of the jump tower to the runway far below. The judges and spectators look like insects from this height. GO! Your coiled body lurches forward and suddenly you're into another world!

You crouch down low, in a tucked position, to accumulate as much speed as possible. At the take-off, you leap out, push up, and lean forward, over the edge or your skis, to reduce wind resistence and increase the length of your jump.

+  Press the FIRE button or SPACE BAR to begin your approach.

+  When you reach the takeoff point, press the FIRE button or SPACE BAR again.

+  In the air, watch the upper right-hand corner of the screen for the faults. Correct faults quickly to get maximum style points and distance.

   If your knees are BENT, move the joystick UP or press the 'I' key to correct.
   If your're too far FORWARD, move joystick LEFT or press the 'J' key.
   Too far BACK, move joystick RIGHT or press the 'K' key.
   SKIS CROSSED, move joystick DOWN or press the 'M' key.


If you don't correct your faults in time, your ski jumper's wild antics will
cause wind resistance and lose style points.
Ski jump scores are based on distance and form.

DISTANCE: is based on the timing of the takeoff, and the aerodynamics of the jumper in the air.

STYLE: You'll get more points if you recover quickly from faults and don't fall.

Scores
~~~~~~
Your maximum is tallied by multiplying your DISTANCE (X) 3 (+) STYLE POINTS. A
respectable Ski Jump score would be a flight of 60 meters and 20 style
points for a total of 200 points.


---------
Biathalon
---------

Race over a cross-country track on skis with a .22 caliber rifle slung over your shoulder. You have only a few cartridges to fire at the required targets, so steady your sights and develop an eagle eye before you fire away!

+  Press the FIRE button or SPACE BAR to start cross-country skiing.

+  Move your joystick LEFT and RIGHT or press the keys 'J' and 'K' to move your skier's legs in steady, rhythmic kicks and glides.

+  On LEVEL GROUND, keep up a steady pace by moving your joystick back and forth or pressing 'J' and 'K'.

+  For UPHILL terrain, move the joystick faster or press the keys faster to increase speed.

+  DOWNHILL stretches go fastest if you're using the double-pole technique. Pull the joystick back or press the 'M' key when the skier's hands are in front, to get the maximum push down the slope.

+  SHOOTING: You are issued FIVE cartridges to shoot at FIVE TARGETS, and every miss is a five second penalty. The gun must be loaded and the shell ejected for each shot. Pull the joystick BACK or press the 'M' key to open the chamber. Push
the Joystick FORWARD or press the 'I' key to load the shell. Push the FIRE button or SPACE BAR to shoot. Repeat for the next shot. The skier's heart rate affects your accuracy -- so cool down, and take careful aim before you fire!

+  The winner is the skier with the fastest total time.


-------
Bobsled
-------

Prepare to careen down a track of solid ice -- while you crouch in a precision built machine of steel and aluminum. You'll fly around hair-raising turns, then plummet down the bumpy straightaways at speeds exceeding 90 miles per hour!

+  Press the FIRE button jor SPACE BAR to begin the race.

+  Move the joystick LEFT and RIGHT or press keys 'J' and 'K' to guide your sled, pull BACK on the joystick or press 'M' to brake.

HINTS: Steer hard! To avoid capsizing at the turns, try to anticipate the pull of centrifugal force, and steer hard in the OPPOSITE direction.

Watch your speed! The power bar at the bottom of the screen shows how fast you're going. The faster you go, the harder you have to steer to keep plummetting toward the finish.

+  The winning bobsled's score is based upon the fastest time through the tracks.
