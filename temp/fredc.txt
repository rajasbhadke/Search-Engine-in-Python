 JOIN, SPLIT AND INDENT PARAGRAPHS
 In order to join or split paragraphs you must be able to insert and delete chara
 
 These are the steps to follow to JOIN PARAGRAPHS:
 1.  Place the cursor on the first letter of the bottom paragraph.
 2.  APPLE //e -- Tap the DELETE key until the paragraph is moved
                  up to where you would like it.
     APPLE ][+ -- Tap <D>elete
 
 These are the steps to follow to SPLIT A PARAGRAPH:
 1.  Place the cursor in the space directly AFTER the last letter
     or character that defines the end of the first paragraph.
 2.  Press the RETURN key twice to separate the paragraphs.
 
 These are the steps to follow to INDENT A PARAGRAPH:
 1.  Place the cursor on the first character of the paragraph.
 2.  Press the space bar (or press TAB for 5 spaces).
 
 
 CHANGING UPPER/LOWER CASE
 1.  Place the cursor at the beginning or end of the block which
     you wish to change.
 2.  Type the <C>ase command.
 3.  Use the left or right arrow to move across the block to be
     changed.
 
 Upper case letters will change to lower case, and vice versa.
 
 CENTERING A LINE
 You may automatically center a line of text, provided:
 a.  The line preceeding it ended with a RETURN
 b.  The line to be centered ends with a RETURN
 
 Steps
 1.  Place the cursor on the line of text
 2.  Type <X>
 3.  The line will center and cursor will move to the next line.

 BLOCK MOVE
 
 Moving blocks of text is very easy.  However, it will move only 250 characters a
 
 1.  Move the cursor to the space immediately after the last
     word you want to move.
 
 2.  //e: Hold Open Apple key down; ][+: Hold Shift key down.
 
 3.  Tap the left arrow key until all text you wish to move has
     disappeared.
 
 4.  Move the cursor to the new location of the text.
 
 5.  //e: Hold Open Apple key down. ][+: Hold the Shift Key down
 
 6.  Tap the right arrow key until all the letters you want     are recovered.
 
 NOTE:  This moves only up to 250 characters at a time. See DOC.B for ways to COP

 FIND;    FIND and REPLACE
 
 These are helpful and important advanced features.  You will probably not use th
 
 There are three ways to use the find and replace feature:
 
 1)  FIND -- to quickly search out words and phrases in a document.
 
 2)  FIND and REPLACE -- manual
 
 3)  FIND and REPLACE -- automatic
 
 
 FIND a WORD or PHRASE:
 1. Move to the <B>eginning of the file.
 
 2. Type the <F>ind command.
 
 3. At the prompt at the bottom of the screen, type a delimiter
    (an exclamation mark, slash, etc.;  see below)
 
 4. Write the string (word or phrase) you would like to find
 
 5. Enter the delimiter again.
 
 6. Press the RETURN key.
 
    In other words, if you were looking for the word 'Apple', you
    would type
      <F>ind:  !Apple! RETURN
 
 7. The program will scan the file and will stop at the first
    occurrence of that string.  If you want to find another
    occurrence of the string, press the RETURN key.   Press any
    other key to stop.
 ..page
 MANUAL FIND AND REPLACE
 
 FIND AND REPLACE allows you to quickly and easily make numerous identical change
 
 Here are the steps for a manual find and replace:
 
 1. Move to the <B>eginning of the file
 
 2. Type the <F>ind command
 
 3. Type a delimiter after the prompt (See below for legal
    delimiters).
 
 4. Enter the string (word or phrase) you want to find.
 
 5. Enter the delimiter again.
 
 6. Enter the new string.
 
 7. Enter the final delimiter.
 
 8. Press the RETURN key.
 
    Example:  <F>ind !Aple!Apple!
 
 FrEd will scan the file from the cursor forward.  When it finds the next occurre
 
      [F]ind:  RETURN=Proceed / Y=Replace
 
 9. Press either:
 
 a)RETURN to continue the search without replacing the search string.
 
 b)Y to replace the search string with the new string.  After the change is made
    [F]ind:  RETURN=Proceed
       Press either:
       RETURN to continue the search.
       ANY OTHER KEY to stop the search.
 
 The ESC key can always be pressed to terminate the FIND operation.

 AUTOMATIC FIND AND REPLACE
 
 When you use the manual FIND and REPLACE you are prompted at every occurrence of
 
 However, when you use the automatic FIND and REPLACE FrEd will scan the entire d

 Be careful when using the automatic FIND and REPLACE.
 
 The CASE of the letters will make a difference.  If you ask for a search for the
 
 The SPACES will make a difference.  If you ask for a replacement of the word HE
    HE     will become       SHE
    THEY   will become       TSHEY
    THEM   will become       TSHEM
    THERE  will become       TSHERE, etc.
 You can avoid this problem by using spaces in your search string.   (! HE ! SHE
 
 
 DELETING WITH FIND AND REPLACE
 
 You may also use find and replace to delete up to 255 characters. 1. Mark the be
    with a marker, such as %% or $$.   Refer to the next section
    for information on the special search symbols.
 
 2. Move the cursor so it is above the section to be deleted.
 
 3. Type the <F>ind command.
 
 5. Enter this information  <%%=%%<<
 
 6. Press the RETURN key.

 DELIMITERS and SPECIAL SEARCH SYMBOLS
 
 
 FrEdWriter recognizes several different delimiters so you can conduct very sophi
 
 
 THIS CHART SHOWS THE POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS:

      #      $               %        &
 
      &      '(apostrophe)   (        )
 
      *      +               ,        -
 
 
 FIND AND REPLACE EXAMPLES
 !cat!dog!          All occurrences of 'cat' will be found,
                    you'll be asked if you would like it to
                    be changed to 'dog'.
 <Th??g<            Any five letter word will be found that
                    begins with a Th and ends with a g
 <??t<              Any three letter word will be found that
                    ends in 't'.
 &later.(&now.(&    Any sentence ending with the word later will
                    be found.  You'll be asked if you would like
                    the word 'later' changed to 'now'.
 <>< <              All RETURN keys (inverse Ps) will be found.
                    You'll be asked if you like the RETURN deleted
                    and a space inserted. (Useful feature for
                    telecommunications!)
