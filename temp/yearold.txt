  "FOUR?!"

  NRA Responds to Abysmal Results of Year-old Gun Control Scheme

  Washington, D.C. -- The Clinton Administration has not turned its
  back on armed criminals.  It is in wholesale retreat.

  That's the reaction of the National Rifle Association of America to
  Attorney General Janet Reno's report of the results of one year of
  the Brady Act.  Attorney General Reno told reporters today that the
  national waiting period scheme prompted a total of four
  prosecutions of prohibited persons attempting a gun purchase.

  "Four prosecutions!  It is an outrage and still another sign of
  utter ineptitude," said Mrs. Tanya K. Metaksa, Executive Director,
  NRA Institute for Legislative Action.  "You reduce crime by
  arresting, prosecuting and imprisoning criminals -- not by meekly
  saying 'no' to the rare criminal who attempts a commercial
  purchase."

  "The Clinton Administration is in wholesale retreat from the
  violent crime front," she continued.  "In its first two years in
  office, the Administration has allowed the prosecution of armed
  criminals to plummet 23%.  Today, they have the audacity to point
  to four prosecutions prompted by the Brady Act."

  Mrs. Metaksa noted that the bulk of persons initially identified as
  prohibited from purchase under the Act are later found to be
  qualified.  "There are people being wrongly denied their
  constitutional rights due to misidentification and unpaid parking
  tickets.  That must end."

  She noted also, "On constitutional grounds, Brady is broken.  Five
  federal courts have struck down portions of the Brady Act as
  unconstitutional, and states are moving to fix it themselves." 
  Mrs. Metaksa said more and more states are opting for the NRA-
  backed instantaneous background check already on-line in Virginia,
  Florida, Delaware, Wisconsin, Illinois, South Carolina, Colorado,
  Utah and Idaho.  "It's fast, fair and effective.  Above all, check
  results prove that it is only the rare criminal who attempts a
  commercial purchase.  But when he does, the NRA-backed instant-
  check prompts instant arrest, while the wait prompts flight."
