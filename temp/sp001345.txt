                          AFA CONTACTS

                         --------------

  In the fight against fascism in Britain, Anti-Fascist Action has

a record that is second to none. Our unique combination of physical

confrontation and ideological struggle has produced results time

and time again.

  We say no platform to fascists - no meetings, no marches, no

paper sales, no leafleting - and we mean it, as the fascists know

only too well. Our aim is to cause the maximum disruption to

fascist activities.

  But that doesn't mean that AFA only needs street-fighters. Far

from it. Everyone has a role to play in AFA, wether they feel

confident in physical confrontations or not.

  None of our successes in physically confronting the fascists

would have been possible without the contribution of non-

combatants. From legal observers to scouts, from leafleters to

people who can write articles or speak at meetings, AFA needs

people with a whole range of skills if it is to continue to

succeed.

  There's a lot to do, so don't wait around. Join today.
