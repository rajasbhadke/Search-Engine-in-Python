       I see you...all of your kind.
    And every last bit of 
          You
                      is within my
    Sight.
         You and your Kind
    Disgust 
           Me; the only prejudice
    In 
           Me.

       I Hate You
           and Your Fears
           in Your Shells...
    You are too frightened
       to Break Out;
    You just
             Drift
       across the Landscape,
    Feeling that you
       have no Control...

  Grasping too tightly to such an 
    Unimportant Aspect
  Is surely the way
    Not to get it;
  Those of Us who
    Don't care about
       That
  Gain It.


          I stand here, 
      Feet set firmly on this 
              Grey Sand,
          You move whenever 
      The wind buffets You; 
          I plant my steps
      Carefully -

             I think I'll go and explore the mountains
...perhaps one of you wretches will blow by. 


  I can satisfy my Desires,
  I can do what I want;
  If you like, I'll teach you
  How to wield your own hammer
  And that Shell.
  Will Break.
