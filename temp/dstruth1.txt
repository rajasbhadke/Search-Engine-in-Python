...Ahem! Rod Serling..youre pissing me off.  Youre the one who sits around
and complains about badly cracked games..hah  Bad Neuromancer.. bad Might
and Magic.. Bad Test Drive and Carmen Europe. well you can crack them, if
you think you can do a better job.  For YOUR info.."I cracked THEM!" and I
took out the protection as much as i could see!  If you cant crack, don't
complain..
USAlliance will be putting the patch for Neuromancer up on their BBSes, and I'll
 upload the newest games I do for them as I finish so you can have a see
of them the second after I send them to Blue Adpet for him to stick his credit
screen on..  All I want is the games, i dont care what the credit is. Blue <Alan
> is a good friend, and Im doing this favor for him.. And you talk of
title screens?  It doesnt matter how lame they are, as long as the game works
fine.. so stop your bull complaining, and start playing.

Is another Bad Crack from Tom.. If I was USAlliance, I'd fold up today and forge
t about it. Im' tired of non working games. I got one from First class
to, Soko ban. After playing it for a while , the graphics get really screwed
up. I've downloaded 3 copies of that ware, from here, the Barrier, and Planet
of Doom. These bad cracks are making me mad. For Gods sake even Ultima 5 is
bad and trhat is another group..but I think there's a patch for that one. Tom,
test out your games before releasing them, if I was Blue Adept, I'd find a bette
r cracker if these bad wares keep coming out.

I think Blue Adept is Undertakers cracking name.  He is in the USAlliance. All
I want to know is when is my good Neuromancer going to be out? I might as well
but trhe damn thing, its' been out in the Software City store at the mall for
a long time now..

My friend calls a couple boards in area code 201, and Blue adept is on one
of them. And tom doesn't call out of Arkansas!

  I thought I had settled that with Matchpicker on Barrier, but now I get
this on here as well. As I said before, Blue Adept <Alan> is a good friend
of mine, who lives real close to me, <about 30 mins> since I live in Blakely
and he lives in Mountain Valley. Some nights he calls me up with something
new and I grab it during lunch or after work. Then I send it back and he gives
it out with a title screen.. I let him do what he wants it doesnt matter to me
all I like to have is the new games.

Someone asked about Neuromancer.. I <think> Alan knows what to do as far as
fixing it goes.. I haven't had a chance to send him to patch which will fix
side 4 yet, but I told him about what to do on the phone. Ill try to put it up
if I have a chance. Don't poke at Alan, he's a good kid, and is learning more
about cracking and will be really good if he keeps coming over on weekends..We'r
e having I big swap on Friday night..<I posted about it on General>. Blue Adept
did a few good cracks too, Paperboy, Gauntlet (with some
help), and a few things for the IIgs. Boy, I'd like to have one of those! Anyway
s guys, I'd like it if you'd stop roaring about bad wares. We'll try
to fix them when we have a chance.

 So these two guys are different? I always thought Blue adept was in
the US Alliance.  I saw a game called Street Soccer up on a board I call
I'm going to get it and put it up here if it isn't already up here.

     Isn't the ware called STREET.SOCCER.A the Street Spo

I thought you might find the above interesting.
It seems that someone else is doing the cracking for The Blue Adept.
