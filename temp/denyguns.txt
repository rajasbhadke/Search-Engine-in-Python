BILL TO DENY GUNS TO ABUSIVE SPOUSES.
WASHINGTON (AP)  October 20, 1993

Several women lawmakers rallied around New Jersey Rep. Robert Torricelli 
yesterday as he offered a bill designed to keep guns away from people 
convicted of battering their wives or abusing their children.

"There is nothing between an abusing spouse and a handgun.  There is no 
restraint of law," the New Jersey Democrat said as he explained how his 
'Domestic Violence Firearm Prevention Act" could reduce the number of 
women and children killed each year.

Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., introduced the companion Senate bill.  
The federal legislation is modeled on restrictions already are on the books 
in Minnesota and California.

Currently, gun ownership is prohibited for anyone convicted of a felony or 
deemed mentally incompetent.  The proposed legislation would add to the 
list anyone convicted of misdemeanor crimes involving violence against a 
spouse or child, as well as those people under court order to stay away 
from a family member.

Torricelli called his legislation complementary to the Brady bill, which 
would give law enforcement officers five days to conduct background checks 
of potential gun buyers.  The Brady bill, which is soon expected to come 
before Congress, has the supportof the Clinton administration.

Torricelli said he became interested in this aspect of gun control after 
a Rutherford, N.J., a woman won a restraining order against her husband,  
only to be murdered by him in fornt of her children.

Note:  Remember Linda's post about the "Child Abusing" spouse that smoked
in front of her child.  According to this article, that person would be
prohibitted from owning a handgun.  (see first paragraph).

Again I state, if a bill such as this passes, then you will see the 
definition of "child abusers" include wide-ranges.  I forsee anyone
convicted of DWI or DUI being labeled a child abuser.  In fact it would
NOT surprise me to see anyone "convicted" or fined by the EPA to be labeled
a "child abuser"  (After all they "abused" Mother Earth, what do you think
they do to their own children)

Do you spank your children?  How about if you decide you do not want to
vaccinate your children?

The evil of this bill is their doublespeak and fallacious labeling.  Since
the majority of Americans do not abuse their child, they will see no wrong
in preventing a "child abuser" or spouse abuser from obtaining a handgun.
