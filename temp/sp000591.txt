                     *A RENT TRACT FOR LEW WELCH*

                           by David Meltzer

      At the first of the month I went to the Rental Agency.

      --Listen, I told her, -- I can't pay this month's rent because
   I quit my job because I have a great work that I am working on that
   demands a great deal of all my time. My job was a rock in my heart,
   a black cloud in my head, & I am a poet who needs time to be alone,
   to wander, study, loaf & drink, think, read, love my wife, learn
   about my children, & work every day & every night on my great work.
   I gave this month's rent to my wife for food, diapers & wine. Won't
   you just forget about the rent until my great work is done?

      --Sure, she said, writing out a check for $229 (the exact amount
   to tide us thru a month) -- & come back at the first of the month
   for your next check, she said & turned back to her ledger.
