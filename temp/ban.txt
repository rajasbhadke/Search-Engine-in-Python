     On November 16th -- the day many of you left to start deer hunting,
the City of Milwaukee Public Safety Committee passed a gun ban. Not only
did the Committee take advantage of the extended deer season to slip this
bill through, its chairman, Alderman Don Richards, would not allow people
who attended the hearing to speak unless had received prior permission
from Richards. The ordinance proposal (#901091) then went before the
Judiciary and Legislative Committee on November 20th, where it passed.

     The final step for this proposal is consideration by the entire
Milwaukee Common Council on November 27th, at 9 am. On that day unless
you get involved it may be approved.

     Although touted by Mayor Norquist as merely a ban on the carrying of
uncased gun upon city streets, this ordinance actually prohibits:

    * Carrying a loaded OR uncased gun anywhere "within the City of
Milwaukee," including in your home, whether the gun is intended for
self-defense of merely displayed in a rack.

    * Carrying a loading gun in plain view at your business location
intended for self-defense.

THE RESULT OF THIS RESTRICTIVE ORDINANCE WILL BE TO CLOSE DOWN MANY
LEGITIMATE FIREARM-RELATED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS:

 - Conducting the state-mandated Hunter Safety courses.
 - Continued operation of shooting facilities and ranges.
 - Gun shows and sport shows where guns are uncased.
 - The hiring of armed guards in private buildings.

YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES!  You can continue to complain about laws like this
being passed. Or, you can take action and help to stop this anti-gun
legislation.

Remember Mayor Norguist has asked the State Legislature to pass this type
of gun law at the state level. And the same politicians who keep pushing
for "gun control" schemes refuse to restore the police positions that
have been cut.

If you want to see the proposal stopped before it becomes law, then you
must:

       Street, on November 27th. (Call 278-2221 to be certain that ordinance
