     In the dark ages, All Hallows Eve night is definitely a good time to be safely indoors. Alas, such precautions do not save Save Gawain of the Round Table from the products of his own forebodings. With sleep the trap is sprung; and the poor knight finds himself launched upon a dream quest bound for the deepest pits of Hell itself! As Gawain in Broderbund's "Brimstone" you are emeshed in a web from which there is no escape save the words of a key phrase-- a simple bit of self-knowledge explaining just how you have come to such a sorry state.

     As the dream begins, Gawain stands before a fog enshrouded alter-Camelot. Here he first encounters the Lady Enitharmon, a sometimes helpful but usually passive dungeon master archetype. Otherwise, deceit is the only truth and soon the knight is dumped upon the icy plains near Ulro's very core. Here then is the true beginme you do a "RESTORE", and having to compete with nearly constant disk access to enter commands, then what is? Supported by yet another super-classy, beautifully illustrated, hardcover semi-novel, "Brimstone" is a game you will love to hate, if only because, once begun, it demands to be finished.


Available from Broderbund: 17 Paul Drive, San Rafael, CA 94903. (415) 479-1700. $44.95
