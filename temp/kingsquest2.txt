Softdocs by: The Bit Blitz

   A long, long time ago, when creatures of myth and magic walked
the  earth openly with lesser mortals, there dwelt in the kingdom
of Daventry a King name Graham. He  had one the crown by his  wit
and  courage, when he went forth to uncover and reclaim the three
lost treasures of Daventry. Now Graham ruled over the land,  with
the  aid of the  mirror that foretold  the future, the bottomless
treasure chest, and the invincible shield. The people of Daventry
prospered under the reign of the kindly monarch.

   Just one year after returning from his first victorious quest,
King Graham arose and looked into the mirror as he was wont to do
daily.  Much to his  astonishment, he beheld  the face of Edward,
the King who came before him in the succession.

   King Edward spoke, "Graham, your kingdom is strong now, thanks
to  the recovery of the three treasures and your wise leadership.
But it will soon grow weak again, if you do not provide and  heir
to  the throne. Marry, my son, and give your people a prince that
make their future secure."

   The vision faded.  King Graham  pondered how he  might find  a
bride  fit to reign over Daventry. He consulted with Gerwain, his
wise prime minister.

   "She must be good, and kind,  so that she will love my  people
and  they will love here," said Graham. "She must have the wisdom
to counsel me in my daily  problems, and a loving heart to  bring
me  comfort. I  wish my  Queen to  glow with  an inner  beauty of
spirit as well as beauty of face and formt."

   Gerwain suggested that Graham  host a celebration, and  invite
all  the maidens of  marriageable age from  his whole kingdom. He
could then observe and conserve  with the likely candidates,  and
see if any one of them fit his idea of a queen.

   The  invitations were sent  out, and the  whole kingdom turned
out for  the  celebration.  From every  corner  of  Daventry  the
maidens  came. Short and tall, slender  and plump, fair and dark,
pretty and plain. There were  maidens from all stations of  life,
from  Dukes' and earls'  daughters to the  village goose girl and
the scullery maid from the castle kitchens. They all had but  one
thing in common: They greatly admired the handsome King, and were
eager to catch his eye. Word had spread that the King was looking
for  a  bride, and  they  were all  thrilled  at the  prospect of
marrying the charming Graham.

   For two days the celebration wore  on, and though he tried  to
be  cheerful, Graham gradually became somber. None of the maidens
he had met quickened his pulse. One maid squinted, another triped
over  everything in sight. Another was too coy, and the one after
her giggled constantly. They all  had some fault, however  small.
It  was with great relief that Graham saw his guests ride away at
then end of the  celebration. He retired to  his room to  reflect
gloomily.

   "My  kingdom  is  home  to  hundreds  of  lovely  maidens," he
mourned. "Why is there  not one among them  who touches my  heart
and my dreams."

   As  he asked the  question, King Graham  was standing near the
magic mirror. He glanced  toward it, and  noticed that the  glass
had grown inexplicably cloudy.

   The  mist cleared,  All at once,  King Graham  beheld the most
beautiful maiden  he  had ever  seen.  She had  hair  of  glowing
auburn, and eyes of midnight blue. Her skin was the color of rich
cream, but alas, no roses bloomed in her cheeks, and the  corners
of her pretty mout drooped in sorrow.

   She  was standing at a window, motionless except for the stray
breeze that  stirred her  hair. A  tear fill  from one  eye,  and
sparkled  on her cheek like  a diomand on velvet.  She put up one
hand to brush it away, and Graham was struck by the grace of  her
movement.

   The  kings heart was suddenly enveloped in a strange fever. He
knew that this was the maiden for  whom he longed - this was  the
woman  who must be his  queen. He wanted to  find her and bring a
smile to her lovely face. He wanted to take her in his arms,  and
protect  her from  trouble forevermore. Eagerly  he consulted the
magic mirror.

   "Oh mirror  wis," said  Graham,  "I have  vowed to  make  this
maiden my bride. Where may I find her?"

   The  mirror clouded again, and a voice was heard. "This is the
maiden Valanice. She is from the kingdom of Kolyma, and is  known
for  her  goodness no  less than  her  beauty. The  jealous crone
Hagatha  whisked  Valanice  away   to  an  enchanged  land,   and
imprisoned  her in  a quartz  tower guarded  by a  ferocious wild
beast."

   "I must  rescue her  or  die in  the attempt,"  declared  King
Graham. "How may I find this enchanted land?"

   "You  must travel to the kingdom  of Kolyma," said the mirror.
"There you may search for the  keys which unlock the three  doors
to the enchanted land..."

   The  voice faded and the mirror  cleared. Graham stared at his
own reflection. Vainly did  he call for its  return, to give  him
more  clues to  the whereabouts  of the  magic keys.  Finally, he
shouldered his provisions, and set out on his quest of love.

   Only you, my  bold adventurer  have the power  to finish  this
tale.  Accompany King Graham on his quest to find the magic keys.
Encounter characters  of legend,  folklore and  fantasy.  Explore
underground  caverns, eerie  towers, and  ocean wonderlands. Help

   You  will be faced with challenges that would intimidate those
of lesser timbre. Summon all your strength and courage. Leave  no
stone  unturned, no avenue unexplored, and your perseverance will
be richly rewarded.

avenue.  The  more imaginative  your  solutions, the  greater you
reward.
