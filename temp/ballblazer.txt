The game takes place on a 54 X 21
intergalactic grid.  The object of the
game is to get the ball between the
goal posts on the end of the grid.
The farther away you are from the posts
when you shoot, the more points you
get.  You can also carry the ball in
for one point.  You can tell if you
have the ball or not if it follows you
and is flashing.  You can also steal
your apponents ball.

                               Ballblazer: The Game

     You're strapped in a Rotofoil.  So is your opponent.  The screen is split       so you each have your own view of the game.  You see your opponet's      Rotofoil. Your opponent sees yours.

     You face each other.  One of you starts the game and the ball is fired.         Go for it and get it before your opponent does.  Now find the moving      Goalbeams and blast the ball through for a score.  It's total speed, power      and points--one on one until time runs out.

     The one with the most points wins.  It's easy to play--difficult to      master.  But go to Step One and find out for yourself.

1)  Boot the disk (or 'Brun Ballblazer).
