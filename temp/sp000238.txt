Hi, folks.  I am writing as one of the few remaining NYC Food Not
BOmbs people.  We don't serve food anymore, but we do try to act as a
NYC contact for other FNB people.  Anyway, this posting is a call for
help.  If anybody is interested in doing FNB in NYC give me a call.
(Number's 718-398-4431, leave a message, I'm never home).  I don't
think any of the original FNB workers can organize the group anymore,
so I'd like to simply pass on our supplies to someone who has the
time and space to provide regular meals.  I can help serve, but I
don't have the time to organize.

Any suggestions would really help.  I am sure that there are
interested people in NY who I've never met.  This my call for help.
NYC FNB does sort of exist and we need the help of dedicated NY
anarchist, vegan, caring people.

(people who have never heard of Food Not Bombs can drop me a line.  I
don't want to waste the list's time, but I will send a short history
of FNB to anyone who asks.  )
