     Triumph

  -Sudden,
      (like Lightning)
  A point is passed
  When promise turns to
      Fulfillment;
  When rise turns to 
      Fall;
  When Struggle turns to
      Victory;
  When Life turns to
      Death.

  The moment passes quickly,
  But the Sensation -
        Lingers, as
  A lizard Sunning itself
        For the day -
        Compressed into a single Instant.
  A momentary interval of freefall
        Stretched off...
        Into Infinity.

  -With this infinitesmal slice of Eternity,
   Unbound joy is ours for the taking.
   Feeling as a Caesar -
       A million times a day without reflecting upon it,
   We stumble forward and count
            All as Failures,
                   Unless
  We are Told otherwise.
