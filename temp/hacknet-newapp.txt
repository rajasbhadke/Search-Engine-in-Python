HACKnet Net Application Form, 01-01-1996

___________________________________________________________________

è In order to apply for access to HACKnet, you'll need to complete
  the  following form  and file attach it to  a message  addressed
  to SoNiC, 13:602/2

í Answer questions truthfully and answer as many as you can.

è You may set yourself up with a fake node number eg 13:602/999 so
  that you can send the file attach and verify that your system is
  working.

í If you don't understand the questions in this form,  you may not
  be fully ready to join a message network. I suggest you take the
  time to learn procedures before applying.

è You  may begin  using your  new node number as soon as you get a
  nodelist containing your entry. Do not use it before then.

í You may,  if  you wish,  include  the form  in a message,  but I
  prefer the use of a file attatch, for simple filing.  You *must*
  use your own system.This is proof that your system is funtioning
  properly.

è Private details will  remain confidential.  The only information
  made availble to  the public is  the BBS name,  it's approximate
  location (suburb) and it's phone number  (phone numbers are only
  included in the full nodelist available to trusted nodes only)

í Process of verification:

  When you send in  this application,  it is first   passed to  the
  assistant international co-ordinator. He verifies the application
  and determines  if the applicant can join. If so, the application
  is then  passed along to the  international coordinator.  He will
  then add you to the nodelist and do all the 'paperwork'.  He will
  then send you your new node number etc. via YOUR system. Make sure
  you have a Bad Message Board and a Recovery Board defined (if your
  tosser supports them) otherwise you won't get your stuff.

è This form is arranged in sections. Part A and Part B are essential.
  Part C can be completed if you wish.
