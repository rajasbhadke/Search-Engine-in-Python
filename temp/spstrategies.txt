The printouts are from a collection dating from 1983-1985, and were
generally made on an Epson MX-80 Dot-Matrix printer connected to an
IBM PC-XT. The Bulletin Board Systems and other services were located
throughout the United States, and captured by Jason Scott, who can
attest to their authenticity.

ONE TIME ON A MA BELL'S BASTARDS GROUP CONFERENCE WE FOUND OUT THEY LISTENED 
TO ALL OVERSEAS CALLS. WE CALLED JOHN DRAPER IN HAWAII (THATS CAPTAIN CRUNCH, 
THE ORIGINAL FOR YOU 13 YEAR OLDS) AND HE TOLD US THAT BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY 
DRUG TRAFFICING BETWEEN THERE AND THE CONTINENTAL STATES, ALL CALLS ARE 
MONITORED. WE DID HERE LOTS OF CLICKING ON THE LINE. OH WELL...I DO HAVE PUZZLE
PALACE (AS ADVISED BY STEVE WOZNIAK) AND IT IS GREAT, MY DAD'D UNCLE JOHN 
WAS IN THE NSA. MY DAD SAYS JOHN WON'T ADMIT TO IT BUT HE CAN NEVER TALK ABOUT

BELEIEVE HE WAS.
