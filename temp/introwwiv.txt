     WWIVnews was the news-letter of WWIVnet.  WWIVnet is a small
     network of BBSes.  At its largest, it was about 1600-1700 BBSes
     around the country.  It had some international boards in it, but
     they were mostly in Canada and a few other countries with as many
     as ten boards or so.
     
     I know that East Ray bay was the first editor.  Omega Man was the
     last editor I know of it.  I think I have all the issues of it
     ever... but I am not positive of that.  If anybody has anymore
     issues of WWIVnews, please e-mail them to me.
     
     It should be noted that there was also an IceNEWS for IceNET.  I
     was directly involved in IceNEWS.  I had a few things published in
     WWIVnews, but my best bbs writing was in IceNEWS.
