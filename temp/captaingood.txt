
CAPTAIN GOODNIGHT (Arcade)
Compatible: 64K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, joystick input


     From the insideous Dr. Maybe's remote Fear Islands headquarters comes an ultimatum: "Deliver $200 billion in gold to my agents in 24 hours or face worldwide destruction." Your mission, as the redoubtable Captain Goodnight, is to outfight Dr. Maybe's mechanized minions and destroy the Doomsday Device.

     A long-playing combo of several earlier arcade hits, "Captain Goodnight and the Islands of Fear" features cleverly merged, expertly executed air, land, and sea action scenarios. Lives are unlimited; but each defeat sets you back to the beginning of the current scenario, costing precious minutes. Your "score" is the time remaining when you finally pull the plug. (Don't expect any medals for almost saving the world.)

     Unfortunately, the game is so difficult to win that, although high winning scores are saved, such competition is practically eliminated. This and the occassional forced defeat (to show off one of several rescue sequences) are definite minuses.

     Complete with map and official decoder wheel, "Captain Goodnight'" is fun to play, somewhat addictive, and often frustrating. If you can avoid ripping the diskett to pieces, this one is good for many stimulating replays.
