
THE CRIMSON CROWN (Picture-Text Adventure)
Compatible: 64K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive


     Old soldiers fade away but a juicy monster lives forever in sequels. Thus, having rescued Princess Sabrina and "destroyed" the evil vampire of "Transylvania" fame, you find that your work remains unfinished. Demonstrating a singular lack of good sportsmanship, the vampire has not only returned, but killed good King John, stolen the magical Crimson Crown, and now threatens to sieze the entire kingdom.

     Accompanied by Sabrina and her brother Erik, you set off on a quest to scotch the vampire and recover the crown (without which Erik may not ascend the throne). Since the vampire seems to be busy terrorizing peasants, there is plenty of time to deal with riddle-spouting gryphons, possesed cats, and bad tempered zombies; besides getting to know a friendly sage. Finding the enemy's stonghold is your main problem; and a wizard may help, if you retrieve a powerful artifact stolen by a wicked witch who lives in the west.

     This game has something for everyone, including well-done graphics and even a frog prince. Every bit as challenging as its predecessor, "The Crimson Crown" is picture-text adventuring at its best.
