Mindwheel (Text Adventure)
Compatible: 48k Apple II+, //e, //c
Requirements: One disk drive; Second drive and 80-column card optional

     Convinced that modern civilization teeters on the brink of disaster, you agree to become the subject of a uniquely hazardous experiment in mind travel. If all goes well, Dr. Virgil's neuromatrix will enable you to explore four dead, yet still powerful minds, journey back to mankind's dawn, and return with the Wheel of Wisdom.

     Each of the four minds, (a rock music star, a dictator, a poet, and a scientist) imposes its own reality and images. Your task in each reality is to locate helpful items and uncover clues to the Wheel's 'location'. As might be expected, the more interesting, more alien situations arise near the boundaries between minds.

    "Mindwheel" is called "an electronic novel" largely because it is an extension of a hardback manual/unfinished novel included in the package. While the nicely illustrated book is something of a treasure in itself, the game depends too much upon battering the player with hints and not enough upon good parsing and individual initiative.
