The following information file was pulled from the X_Net Node List.  I maintain
X_Net here in Austin, TX, but we have netted boards as far and wide as San
Francisco and Washington DC.  Currently X_Net is looking to expand by adding
good New Edge/Cyberpunk BBS systems nationwide.

If you run a BBS or know someone who does--and they can run Fido software--
you can contact me at:

stevem@cs.utexas.edu

And we can discuss X_Net or make arrangements to get you jacked in.

X_Net -- A Cyberpunk Echo Net

   X_Net is a New Edge/Cyberpunk echo running on a Fido-compatible network
   but on a pirate band.  It is not standard-Fido-compatible and X_Net
   boards   will not appear in the standard Fido nodelist.  The current
   version of the   X_Net nodelist is available on the Zen Wedgie BBS.
   It may be possible to run standard Fido echoes AND X_Net echoes
   together, but   this has not been tested.  I'm not too pleased with
   the standard Fido echoes,   so I don't think I'll pursue this.
   If anyone out there buys into the Fido   hype and wants to check out
   X_Net/Standard Fido compatibility: be my guest.   X_Net, however, will
   provide a forum for things that would NEVER appear on   ''legit'' Fido
   echoes.  Subjects like hacking, cracking, and illicit drugs most
   likely wouldn't find a forum on Fido.  So rejoice!  X_Net is here!

The following echo areas are currently supported:

   General              - general discussion
   Cracking/Hacking     - software protection, computer security issues
   Mind Expansion       - drugs, nootropics, philosophy, religion
   Virtuality           - VR, robotics, tech play
   Cyberspace           - electronic freedom, information access, EFF,
                          The Net
   MONDO 2000           - talk of the magazine and other like-minded zines
   Chaotic Discord      - chaos theory, discordian theory, other nonsense
   Multimedia           - anything involving the meshing of several media
                          formats
   Digital Innovation   - developing technologies, news on new hardware,
                          etc.
   Free Association     - general purpose mindless drivel
   Sysop                - X_Net business and news.

To be a member of X-Net, you must first agree to abide by the following
rules  and regulations.  Well hold you to these rules, so be aware.  Also,
a modified version of this rule list will be posted periodically on the
X-Net General echo  for the users to read.  Users will have to abide by a
set of regulations also.

                          X-Net Rules and Regulations

I.   To be granted access to X-Net and to retain that access, each sysop
and user person must
     read, understand, and abide by all the rules stated here (including
     this one.)
II.  Use of handles or pseudonyms is allowed, welcomed, and even
     appreciated on X-Net.
III. The Sysop of an X-Net board has the right to impose any additional
rules or regulations governing the
     use of X-Net on their board.  Provided that the addition of any such
     rules do not override or negate any of the original rules and
     regulations as stated here.
IV.  There can be no flaming on the net. Flaming is defined as taking
     argument for the sake of argument, or argumentative posting with
     intent to incite argument for the sake of argument.  Flaming is often
     the making of small-minded comments, the taking of cheap shots,
     hitting with low blows, and in general being a total nuisance.
     There is nothing wrong with a good solid logical argument, but
     flaming is forbidden.
V.   The Sysop of an X-Net board has the right to revoke any user or
     users access to the net without prior consultation or any
     justification whatsoever.  Don't piss off the Sysops, in other
     words--they're an unfed bunch of hungry mongrels.
VI.  Posts on X-Net echoes should correspond to the general topic of
     the given echo, unless the echo is intended for free-form
     posting/yammering.  Trash posting on X-Net echoes is not
     appreciated, and off-subject posting is irritating.  See Rule V.
VII. The use of X-Net for commerical purposes, to raise money for a
     business, or to turn a profit from the members of the net for a
     commercial enterprise is EXPRESSLY forbidden.  This is not to say
     that personal items may not be put up for sale on X-Net.  A great
     distinction is made between items sold personally, and items sold
     for a business venture.
VIII.A majority of other X-Net sysops may form a coaltion to force a
     given X-Net sysop to change, remove, or modify policy IN REGARD TO
     X-NET ONLY.  This includes the banning of a given user on said
     sysops BBS from X-Net.  A 51% or greater vote on the Sysop group
     of X-Net is binding.  If the sysop in question does not comply with
     the determined majority policy, the other sysops have the right to
     stop X-Net feeds to that node.
IX.  A majority vote of active X-Net sysops is sufficient to add
     amendments to the original rules and regulations of X-Net which
     apply to all X-Net boards (in contrast to rule III above.)  No
     amendments may be made which override any of the original rules.
X.   In the case where 50%-50% stalemates occur, the issue is dropped
     and may not come up again until there is sufficient cause.
XI.  Each Sysop on X-Net MUST carry the X-Net Sysopecho group.
