         [ Newsflash! ]

The real purpose of the National 
Enlightener is to take a objective
look at the pirate/phreak world.
With it's pirate/phreak cast as 
rock star syndrome.

We have nothing against anyone, but
find the actions of most of the so
called "elites" completely stupid. Not
to mention funny. So they are brought
to you along with our commentary,
whenever we find the time.

---------------------------------------
Giving credit where it's due:
-----------------------------

Mr. Xerox was a very good programmer &
pirate. His personality needs some re-
programming, but other then that. He is
(or was) good at what he did.

Zero Page, same thing.

Lord Digital, same thing. But looking 
at some of his old posts (2-3 years 
ago), and comparing it to what he has
had to say in the last 6 months or so,
We would be inclined to agree with The
(980 wpm) Infiltraitor, about him 
having grown up and found a new person-
ality. Now if only Mr. Xerox would do
the same thing.

The Wizard 414, & Broadway Hacker (like
many others) damn well deserve what 
they get.

Gadget master, same thing.

The Atom, same thing. But he doesn't 
really need our help in making him
look stupid.

The Infiltraitor, frankly, we don't
know what to make of this guy. Except
for the evident fact that he is a fast
typist. 

King Blotto, mixed review. On the one
hand, looking at some of his posts, We
are inclined to believe that he is a
perfectly mature, non-idiot, person. &
we almost find ourselves thinking him
likeable (like Lord Digital with his
new and improved personality), But 
then, he either slips back into his old
personality, or pulls a Jekyll & Hyde,
and where there was a intelligent person
30 seconds ago, there is now a 23 year
old man ranting and raving at a bunch 
of people, 5-10 years younger then he 
is, and calling them rodents and losers.
A perfect example of this is his reply
to the Atom. At first he brings up 
things we agree with 100%, but then he
takes a sharp turn into left field and
starts rambling about rodents, chicken-
shit's, and drinking the Atom's blood.
In our humble opinion, if he ever got
his head together, stopped ragging
and hating so many people, and let his
intelligent side come through more 
often. He'd be human.

---------------------------------------

Wrapping this up, we're not amateur 
phsycologists. Rather we are telling
it like we see it. 

Many of the people are good at what
they do (or did) (not you Atom), and
we can't fault their abilities. But on
the other hand, some of them should 
take some time out and get a new
personality.

ANother thing most of them seem to
thrive on is hatred and pettiness.
People who have never met, never 
talked, live on other sides of the
US, vehemently hating each other for
no reason. When they run out of 
"enemy elites" to hate, they turn
their ego's loose on all the "rodents"
of the world. And this is not our
imagination. We will show their 
posts in our next installment. 

Of course, any ELITES!@#! who happen
to read this, will ignore it, or call
us rodents. Since real elites, can't
take criticism. Anyone pointing out
the truth is a rodent.

Enough of this, until next time,

"I can't be wrong, I'm elite!"
