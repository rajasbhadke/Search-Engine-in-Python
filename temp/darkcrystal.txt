             HOW TO SOLVE THE DARK CRYSTAL
           ---------------------------------

NOW, AS BEFORE EVERYTHING IN "QUOTES" IS A DIRECT COMMAND, AND EVERYTHING
INSIDE A [BRACKET] IS A DIRECTIONAL MOVE. (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST). I'LL
START OFF WITH SOME BASIC STUFF AND THEN GET TO THE GOOD STUUF.

1ST- GETTING STARTED

1. TO ESCAPE THE GARTHIM JUST ENTER A DIRECTION, YOU WILL ALWAYS OUT RUN THEM
   AS THEY ARE SLOW!
2. THE 'CRYSTAL BAT' ALERTS THE SEKISIS OF WHERE YOU ARE, AND IN TURN, THE
   GARTHIM ARE INFORMED OF YOUR LOCATION
3. MYSTICS ARE YOUR FRIENDS
4. THE FOLLOWING ITEMS YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET AS THEY DO YOU NO GOOD: SLING
   AND POUCH
5. THERE IS >>NO<< SCORE IN THE DARK CRYSTAL ADVENTURE. THE OBJECT IS TO HEAL
   THE DARK CRYSTAL
6. SEE THE MOVIE (OPTIONAL) MANY OF THE HINTS ARE REVEALED AFTER SEEING IT.

---------------------------------------
         NOW HOW TO SOLVE IT
---------------------------------------

AT THE START OF THE GAME JUST TRY TO MOVE IN >>ANY<< DIRECTION. A MYSTIC WILL
APPEAR. AFTER HE LEAVES FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS [E], "GET SHALE", [W,W,W,W,N],
NOW YOU SHOULD BE AT URSU SO TYPE "SPEAK URSU" THEN "LOOK BOWL" THE GO
[S,E,E,N], AND "DIG", "GET FLUTE" AND TAKE ONE STEP [N]ORTH. (YOU WILL FALL
DOWN BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.) NOW GO: [E,N], "LISTEN BROOK", THEN [W]EST,
"CUT PAD", [E,E,E,E,N,N] AND "USE PAD" (AT SWAMP).

AFTER YOU GET OFF THE PAD GO [N,E]. YOU WILL GET CAUGHT UP IN SOME VINES. JUST
START TYPING DIRECTIONS UNTIL THE DRIVE TURNS ON AND THE PICTURE CHANGES....A
LONG ARM W/AN EYE WILL BE THRUST UP TOWARD YOU.....TYPE "SPEAK BEING", NEXT
TYPE "YES", AND THEN "MOON DAUGHTERS" (ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE). NOW TYPE A RANDOM
DIRECTION AS IT WON'T MATTER BECAUSE IT BREAKS INTO THE MOVE AND GIVES YOU
'BEFORE JEN CAN REACT...' MESSAGE. SHE WILL TAKE YOU TO HER OBSERVATORY, AND
THEN ASK YOU WHAT YOU WANT. TYPE "CRYSTAL SHARD" AND SHE WILL BRING YOU 4
COLORED SHARDS....NOW  "PLAY FLUTE", AND THEN "GET BLUE" (THE BLUE CRYSTAL
SHOULD PLAY BACK THE TUNE THAT YOU ISSUE) NOW GO [S]OUTH, !!GARTHIM RAID!!,
TERRIBILE GARTHIM STORM AUGRA'S LAB. SO TYPE "GO WINDOW", THEN [S,W] AND YOU
WILL FALL INTO A BOG...TYPE "HELP"; KIRA & FIZZGIG WILL HELP YOU OUT.

 NOW TYPE "TURN SHELL", "GET POUCH", "GO SHELL" AND YOU ENTER AT THE POD
VILLAGE.... JUST TRY TO MOVE AROUND UNTIL THE GARTHIM ARRIVE AND THEN GO:
[S]OUTH, (CHANGE DISKS), NOW GO: [S,W,N], AND "SIT DOWN", THEN "LOOK WALL",
(TAKE NOTICE OF THE SHAPES VERY CAREFULLY) NOW TYPE [N]ORTH, BUT BEFORE IT
MOVES YOU NORTH, A CREATURE WILL APPEAR AND SAY THAT HE WILL HELP YOU! (( HE
LIES!!! )) A TRAP!! DON'T FOLLOW HIM! (HE WILL GO SOUTH) NOW TYPE:
[N,N,W,S,S,E,N], NOW, DEPENDING ON WHICH VERSION OF D.C. YOU HAVE, YOU SHOULD
BE AT THE LAND-STRIDERS (TWO LONG-LEGGED BEASTS) SO TYPE "JUMP ON" AND GO
[W,W,W,W,W,S,W,S] AND YOU WILL BE KNOCKED OFF YOUR STEEDS. SO AS THE GARTHIM
APPROACH, TYPE "JUMP", THEN WHILE FALLING, "GRAB KIRA".

WHEN YOU ON THE GROUND GO [W]EST, AND THEN "SEND FIZZGIG" (IT WILL ASK WHERE
YOU WANT TO SEND IT) SO THEN TYPE "SEND BARS", DO ANOTHER RANDOM MOVE TO WASTE
A MOVE AND FIZZGIG WILL RETURN BEFORE YOU CAN REACT. NOW TYPE "USE KEY", "OPEN
BARS" AND THEN GO: [S,S,S,W,W,S] AND THE CHAMBERLAIN WILL APPEAR AND STEAL
KIRA & FIZZGIG. NOW GO [S]OUTH! (YOU WILL FALL IN A PIT WITH GARTHIM!) SO TYPE
"RUN", THEN "GO HOLE", "CLIMB", AND YOU WILL BE IN THE CHAMBER OF LIFE. (AUGRA
WILL BE HERE ALL WRAPPED UP, YOU CAN LEAVE HER AS IT WILL NOT AFFECT THE GAME
PLAY)

GO: [E,S,E,W,W,], "GO CURTAIN", THEN [N,N,W], & "GET SCEPTER", [E,E,E] AND
"USE HOOK" NOW GO :[E,U,E] (U=UP) AND YOU WILL BE ON THE BALCONY. NOW TYPE
"JUMP CRYSTAL", YOU WILL DROP THE SHARD.
OK, NOW YOU WILL HAVE A CHOICE:
A- SAVE KIRA
B- HEAL CRYSTAL

 TO THE QUESTION '..SAVE KIRA..' TYPE "NO" ( AND NO, I'M NOT HEARTLESS) NOW
TYPE "INSERT SHARD"<<--------YOU WIN..... OR DO YOU?

     ----> KIRA IS DEAD <----

LOGICIAL ANSWER: "KISS KIRA" HAVE FUN....
