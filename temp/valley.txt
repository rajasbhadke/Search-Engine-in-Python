Those who wish to make a comment or a correction to BOP may contact me
(Mark Christensen) at Storm Damage, a busy BBS but they have two lines.
I am also capturing the first few seconds of log on to help update my info.

Speaking of BBS lists - if you want to list with "Computer Buyer"

write to- Computer Buyer

   ATTN: BBS Listing   or use their FAX # - (602) 784-2275

                      - if you want to list with "Twilight Software"
                      - Note: apparently they will not have a new list
                      - until next summer

CALL: Twilight Software BBS   14.4 06/21/94 {844 1769}
Tell them about features, non-features, hours, baud and operating system.
Apparently they intend to distribute their BBS list at software outlets.

Fresh copies of BOP are usually found on :  ACM, Cheese Whiz, Coffee Club,
Ghost Rider, Mensa & of course Storm Damage

NOTE: Due to a poorly placed vacation the next BOP will probably be a
      quickie released about the middle of July.
