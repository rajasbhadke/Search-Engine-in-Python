CHOICE IS NOT  FREEDOM                         -by  Shannon  Adam
---------------------

I  would  like  to  have  a  few  of  those  time  lapse  cameras
aroundwhich  would capture the subtle and obtrusive changes which
areoccurring in WEST END.  We are in the  fishbowl  of  the  free
marketand are witnessing the rapid extension of limited freedoms:
thechoice of coffee, the choice of  cafe,  the  choice  of  which
realestate to purchase our investment properties from, the choice
ofwhich  suburb  to  move  to  when  the  rent  get  to  high  or
landlordsget "their kind of people" as tenants

Well, that is my point of view,  but  to  see  what  the  changes
and"gentrification"  look like from your angle, a few people have
puttogether a survey to  gather  opinions.   The  various  ideas,
andcomments  will  be written up and included in the next edition
ofthis paper

This survey is not being done by  scientists  and  you  will  not
bescientifically  selected.   In  fact  we  would be happy if you
wouldselect yourselves. If you are interested keep an eye out  in
localvenues/shops  etc.  and  you  can  add  your version of life
andchanges in West End

The survey is  not  right.   If  you  disagree  with  the  way  a
questionis  asked,  a  question  being asked, or the absence of a
question....  please make notes in the margins or  wherever.   We
wantto  get  inside  your minds.  We want to know what you think,
whatyou feel

But remember this is  not  surveillance.   It  is  fun.   We  are
yourfriends.   We  care  more  than  you  do.  We will look after
everything so there is not need to be politically active.  Do not
stoppatronising  cafes.   You really need a new car.  I think the
newDoc  Martens  are  essential.   Everyone  has  the  right   to
bepsychoanalysed

CHOICE IS NOT FREEDOM
