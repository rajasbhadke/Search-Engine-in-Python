CONTRAFLOW WINTER 93/94

  TEAMSTER AND BUTTHEAD
  
  Class war U.S union style erupted on the picket lines in North
Reading, Massachusetts on April 11, when police arrested 7
Teamsters (union) leaders as nearly 200 strikers clashed with
over 50 riot cops outside the gates of Roadway Express, one of
the companies hit by a strike during a National Teamsters
walkout. The strikers were trying to stop a scab truck when the
badgeless cops rioted, using attack dogs on the crowd and beating
a union member who was video-ing the cops assault. Over 80,000
Teamsters were on strike against national freight hauling outfits
over the issues of downsizing, layoffs, part-timing and
subcontracting to non-union firms.
    In January, Alaskan flight attendents negotiated settlement
in a three year struggle for contract. Using a technique dubbed
by the workers as C.H.A.O.S (Create Havoc Around Our System),
pressure was put on management through a series of rotating work
slowdowns and strikes that kept Air Alaska off guard and
undermined the airlines reliability with passengers.
