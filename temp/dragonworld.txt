To  practice any of  the 3 action games
that you'll  have to  play during  your
adventure  type  ACTION  at  any  time.
(Your place or status in the  adventure
won't be effected by playing the games)
 
Use  Joystick or  the Keyboard controls
are- I/J/K/M and SPACE to fire.
 
1]  BOGS AND BATS - Avoid the fireballs
and swooping  bats and  shoot all  bats
except  the largest  bat at  the end-it
will carry you to safety.
 
2]  MAZE   OF  MADNESS   -  Cross   the
labyrinth  of  pitfalls  and corridors.
If you fall  over a cliff  you have  to
start  again. The ladders  slant in one
of 2  directions and  may disappear  at
any time.
 
3]  DRAGONSTONES  -  is  played  to win
money.  You  win  Talmas  by  selecting
stones  of the right  color. To gamble,
pay 15 talmas  or get  credit for  that
amount  from the  proprietor. There are
4 levels of play.  At each level  there
will be 2 colors of stones, one winning
the other losing. The object is to  get
all  the  stones  of one  color  to win
talmas. If you  get all  the stones  of
the  losing  color and  then  catch the
stone of the small dragon flying across
the screen you'll win talmas.
 
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
 
          REPLENISHING FUNDS
 
When  you  list your  inventory, you'll
see how many  talmas you  have left  to
spend.  You can visit  the Gaming House
in the Bazaar to play Dragonstones  and
play  the game as often  and as long as
desired.
 
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
 
   THE DRAGONPEARL & SPECIAL POWERS
 
Up to 5 times during your adventure you
can use the Dragonpearl.
The Dragonpearl is  a opalescent  stone
that  contains the memory & perceptions
of the Last  Dragon &  those that  came
before  him. The holder  of the Dragon-
pearl possesses great power,  including
the  ability  to be  restored  from the
dead. Enter DP to use the  Dragonpearl.
The   quest  will   be  resumed   in  a
different,  safer  place.  Also,   seek
Hawkwind  at  his  home  early  in  the
adventure; his help will be invaluable.

THE LANGUAGE OF SIMBALA
 
Your commands should always start with
a verb and be followed by a noun.
Multiple nouns may be separated from
each other by means of a comma or and,
such as:
 
TAKE THE AXE AND THE SWORD.
TAKE THE AXE, THE SWORD, AND THE BOX.
TAKE THE AXE, SWORD, AND BOX.
TAKE AXE, SWORD, BOX.
 
(It's not necessary to end with period)
 
Several actions may be included in one
command, but they must be separated by
a comma or the word THEN. If, in a
string of actions, a noun is repeated,
the noun may be replaced with IT. For
example:
 
TAKE THE BOOD THEN READ IT.
TAKE THE BOOK, OPEN IT, THEN READ IT.
OPEN THE BOX AND THE POUCH, THEN CLOSE
THE DOOR.
 
TAKE ALL
will result in all articles being taken
Instructions should be specific. HIT
THE NAIL may elicit the response WITH
WHAT? The complete command would be:
HIT THE NAIL WITH THE HAMMER.
 
The instructions for complicated tasks
should be entered in logical order. For
example, you can't sail the boat with-
out first saying UNTIE ROPE...but if
you untie the rope before you enter the
boat, it will drift away.
 
To speak to another person enter:
 
TALK <name> or ASK <name>
 
If a person or creature speaks to you
start your answer with the word SAY
such as SAY NO (quotes aren't needed)
 
To get information say- ASK ABOUT <the
topic>. When you need Hawkwind's help
enter ASK HAWKWIND or TALK TO HAWKWIND.
