"Nor do piecemeal steps however well intended, even partially resolve
problems that have reached a universal, global and catastrophic Character.
 If anything, partial `solutions' serve merely as cosmetics to conceal the
deep seated nature of the ecological crisis.  They thereby deflect public
attention and theoretical insight from an adequate understanding of the
depth and scope of the necessary changes."

Murray Bookchin, In The Ecology of Freedom (Palo Alto: Cheshire Books,
1982) pg. 3

     To speak of "limits to growth" under a capitalistic market economy
is as meaningless as to speak of limits of warfare under a warrior society.
The moral pieties, that are voiced today by many well-meaning environment-
alists, are as naive as the moral pieties of multinationals are manipulative.
Capitalism can no more be "persuaded" to limit growth than a human being
can be "persuaded" to stop breathing.  Attempts to "green" capitalism, to
make it "ecological", are doomed by the very nature of the system as a
system of endless growth.
