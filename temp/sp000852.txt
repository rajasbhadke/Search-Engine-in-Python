"UNOFFICIAL" SAL NEWS 1994-12-15
======================================================

OCTOBER:	The EU-referendum of Finland was held and pro-EU won with 
=======		57% support. The whole year of 1994 was characterized with
		very strong pro-EU-propaganda. All of the 6-7 leading news-
		papers (reaching the great majority of Finns) as well as two
		state-owned TV-Channels and one commercial TV-Channel 
		(the all we have in finnish!) were PRO-EU.
			SAL was active in opposing the EU. However the co-
		operation between the EU-opposers was not very intense,
		because many of them were right-wing nationalists, rednecks,
		stalinists and even neo-nazis.


OCTOBER 	A special riot-police-forces are founded. The new unit has
NOVEMBER	been through special training and was given special equipment.
========	Such a unit has never existed in Finland before and police
		says it was founded because of left and right wing radicals.
		A more proper explanation may be that the police is afraid
		of possible riots caused by the unemployment (which is in
		Finland at the moment very high - 20%!!)
			One can also wonder, why during the present depression
		the police and the army get more and more funds and the 
		health care and libraries etc get all the time less funds.


NOVEMBER	During the year 1994 has the satanism and satan worshipping
DECEMBER	greatly increased. After a sensational TV-document made by
======== 	the Church (in Finland there is "state-Church") was shown
		there has been a lot of conversation around the matter.
		Very often satanists are claimed to be connected with	
		anarhcism. For instance, the document showed some symbols
		satanists are said to use, and these symbols included 
		circled A (symbol of anarchy), A-stars, peace symbols etc
			The thruth is however, that anarhists have little
		to do with satanists and in fact, the satanists are connected
		to neo-nazis, enemies of anarchists, and drug-sellers.

		In Helsinki and in Joensuu (eastern Finland) the street
		fights between black youths (especially the somali-refugees)
		and skinheads and other local youths have increased. These
		violent fights have now penetrated to the mass media.


6th DECEMBER	The Independence day of Finland. Neo-nazi-violence was	
============	expected, but (luckily) nothing happened. In the former
		years some neo-nazi gangs have attacked colored people
		and rioted on the streets breaking windows etc.
			Sad to say, as far as I know - there was neither
		any anarchist activity against the nationalism and patriotic
		spirit around the 6th of december.
