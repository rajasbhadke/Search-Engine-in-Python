	To get enough balls to solve the game, do the following:

1) Before booting the game, go into basic.
2) Type call-151 to enter the monitor.
3) Type # and return to install the Enter-Monitor CDA.
4) Stick in your Gnarly Golf disk and type 5 control-P <return> (boot gnarly golf)
5) Select 1 player.
6) When your ball is on the golf course, enter the control panel.
7) Choose the Enter Monitor CDA
8) From the monitor type 47C0:FF and return
9) Type control-Y and go back to the game

You now have 255 lives...if you run low again, just repeat the procedure.
Notice that this will make the display at the top where your # of golf balls
are look kind of messed up. If this bothers you, instead of typing FF to
give you 255 balls, type 63 to give you 99 balls.  By keeping the number to
two digits the display will not look messsed.
